Kaeck takes the furious black metal approach of Zyklon-B, Blasphemy or Impaled Nazarene and merges it with the melodic understructure of Immortal or Isengard, producing music with the intensity of war metal but the interesting song structures, melodies and instrumental and vocal variation that traditional black metal pioneered. The result is a more varied album than one might suspect, touching on a number of different techniques and approaches, with each song highly distinct from the rest yet very firmly anchored within the same style. Formed of members of Sammath, Kjeld and Noordelingen, Kaeck shows a way forward for black metal with the power of the past and the intensity of its current far-underground version working together toward a brutal and yet introspective form. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kaeck">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
