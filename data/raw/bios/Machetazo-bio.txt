Machetazo was born in the year 1994 in La Coruña, Spain. 

Firstly it was just a side project into noisegrind, until Dopi left his previous band. He decided to focus on Machetazo, taking it to an absolute level of dedication. He changed the musical orientation, skipping noisecore and turning it into old-school 80s grindcore with influences of nordic death metal. Imagine a mix between Terrorizer, Repulsion, Carcass, Autopsy, Nihilist, Carnage and Funebre and you get the point of what Machetazo is about.

The second demotape Realmente Disfruto Comiendo Cadáveres was the one who opened a lot of gates, catching the attention of Charlie Infection (ex-drummer of Psycho). He released it on 10"MLP and getting proposals for a few splits and the deal with the New York based label Razorback Records. 

During the first years Machetazo was mostly Dopi's project with various collaborators and members going in and out. After the release of the first album Carne de Cementerio Rober came at guitars as a definitive member. Rober and Dopi recorded the second album Trono de Huesos and just after the release Carlos came as bassist in the year 2001. Now Machetazo started to be a real band, a classic power trio, trying hard to survive in a country with zero support for underground extreme music and fighting trends and obstacles everyday. 

Machetazo had a strong reputation and feedback worldwide specially in the USA, Mexico and Japan. The high points in band's history were the split EPs with cult acts like Corrupted, Abscess or General Surgery and the special guest vocals made by Chris Reifert (Abscess, ex-Autopsy, ex-Death) on their album Sinfonías del Terror Ciego.
Finally they split in 2014.
