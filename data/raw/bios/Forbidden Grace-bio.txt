A young Italian black metal band, playing a rough and primitive sounding take on Scandinavian second wave style of black metal. The band has so far released one demo in 2006. Their bio from the MySpace site follows:

"Anno Bastardi MMVI: FG beast raises under the unholy spell of Lord Ematos & Hertier and their devotion for the old Scandinavian Black Metal wave united to their intent to celebrate the inner Darkness.
Various line-up changes during the time have prevented the band a regular activity, but one demo was released in the same year, titled 'Ethereal Winter'.
FG focus their own musical conception as a journey beyond good and evil, combining pure audio violence with cold introspections.
Assisted by Kobal & DevA rhythmics and Skogfrost leads, now FG propose themselves as the artefacts of the human Plague through more filled compositions, to reach its maximum manifest." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Forbidden+Grace">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
