ASHLER is a progressive-gothic-metal band formed in Quito, Ecuador, in 2005. 

Their music is a mix of progressive-metal and gothic rock, with female vocals on top of a very atmospheric sound with eerie melodies and dark, gloomy songs. 

ASHLER was formed in the middle of the world by the following members: Diana (voices), Luisfer (guitars), JC (guitars), Chuck (bass) and Santiago (drums). 

Shortly after being formed, the band recorded and produced their debut, the EP "January 13th", which received good reviews from the local metal community and press, later achieving the same effects internationally. It has 6 tracks including an adaptation of Benoit Jutras Incantation (Cirque du soleil). 

The group also has been part of several compilations like "Sexy Killer Records" (USA/UK), "Dark Notes from the Equinox" (Ecuador) and "Attests Rock and Darkness #13."

ASHLER has a high sense of its own aesthetic and creativity, and thanks to it, is obtaining, little by little, a special place within the world-wide scene. At the moment the band is pre-producing its first full length to be released later this year. 

The band's members cite, as influences, artists like LACUNA COIL, PINK FLOYD, KING CRIMSON, DEF LEPPARD among others.
