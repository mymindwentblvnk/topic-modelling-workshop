Dark At Dawn was formed back in 1993 by Torsten Sauerbrey, Peter Arenz, Michael Lowin, Thorsten Kohlrausch and Oliver Schoening. 

After two demo tapes and some local shows, they recorded a mini-CD called "Oceans Of Time" in 1995. In addition to that Dark At Dawn played the famous Wacken Open Air for the first time and supported Saxon in a couple of shows. "Oceans Of Time" was sold very well at concerts. Various radio stations in northern Germany picked up the band and added the songs to their airplay lists. In 1998 the band shopped around some new songs and demos to find a record company for the first full-length album "Baneful Skies" and finally inked a deal with Iron Glory Records. The debut album was recorded by Oliver Philipps and Christian Moos in the Spacelab studios and was released in late 1999.

In November 2000 Dark At Dawn recorded the second album "Crimson Frost" in the Stage-One-studio with Andy Classen. Dissatisfaction with their label was the reason to make only one more record with Iron Glory Records. This record was produced and mixed in the band's own MetalSound-studio.

"Of Decay And Desire" is the CD released in 2003. It was recorded in the MetalSound-studio, mixed by Andy Classen and was mastered by Mika Jussila at Finnvox Studios in Helsinki. AFM also decided to create a new band logo to underline the growing professionalism of the band. 

The self-titled album of Dark At Dawn has come with another portion of their talent. Again released by AFM Records the album sounds promising enough to be called 'the next masterpiece of the band'. 

They gave their last concert at Harz Rock Open Air on 07.07.2007 and disbanded afterwards.

Dark at Dawn reformed in 2012 and released a new EP "Noneternal" in October 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+At+Dawn">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
