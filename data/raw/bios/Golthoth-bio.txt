Golthoth is a black metal band from Treviso (north-east Italy), born in 2007. This project is born out of a previous band called Veediom (lately became Vediom), well known in the local underground and active for a long time with a lot of live performances since 2004. In 2007 a crisis brought the band to separate from the drummer Rise, so that he name was changed into Golthoth in order to leave behind a name no more bound to the whole band. With a new drummer the band followed a new direction, reaching a sound more extreme but even more articulated which is now their sound: a fast and aggressive black metal refined by some death-metal elements and melodic lines. Golthoth is now promoting their self-produced demo which has been recorded in the last Vediom recording session; four songs have been chosen to represent the actual line up and intents. The band is planning to enter the studio again in winter 2007 to record some brand new material. In autumn '07 the first Golthoth live session will begin...
