Evan Caminiti is a musician, composer and performer based in Los Angeles, CA. 

As well as working with Barn Owl and Higuma, Caminiti has recorded a series of solo albums including Psychic Mud Shrine (2009), West Winds (2010), and so on.  West Winds starts off with "Night of the Archon", some of which is not too far removed from the opening of Brian Eno's On Land. There is also "Thunder Breaks the Dawn" , "Path to the Sea", and "Glowing Sky" - the latter perhaps indebted to My Bloody Valentine and Lovesliescrushing, among others.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Evan+Caminiti">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
