From the bowels of the Waasland, longtime friends Mario (drums) and Jacques (bass) got hit by the idea to form a metalband that would organically combine all the goodness metal has to offer. Bene, not a stranger to the same local beer supplier, was soon solicited on lead guitar to join forces. The year was 2007 and for the first two years the band restricted itself to playing covers to sharpen their musical skills, and to gain insight in what kind of musical elements felt natural to them.

When it was time to embark on a songwriting adventure, Tom was drafted to add an additional layer of violence on rhythm guitar. As the songs took shape, there was originally no inclination to look for a singer. However, in the beginning of 2009, the decision was made to start the search for singer in earnest, which led them to former Octahedron-singer Kris. He quickly provided the songs with lyrics and vocals. Meanwhile, the band functioned under a host of provisional names, most of which had something to do with the bass player’s healthy interest in the female form. In december of 2009, I Inside was chosen to represent the band’s brand from then on.

Now I Inside is ready to hit the stages with their unique blend of crushing poundriffs, groovy rock-‘n-rollers and sweeping song structures. So you’d better keep an eye on I Inside!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/I+Inside">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
