Collision Process are a progressive metal band based in the UK's West Midlands. The band first came together instrumentally in early 2009 to write the music for their first self-titled EP, but it was the addition of lead vocalist Adam Cooper in early 2010 that completed the missing piece of the puzzle, and allowed for the vocal interplay between himself, singer/guitarist Jon Walters and bassist/backing vocalist Dan Willett that now plays a huge role in defining their sound, with abrasive screams weaving in and out between soaring harmonies and melodic call-and-response dynamics.

In the immediate future, Collision Process aim to increase their already growing reputation around the live circuit, also promoting their EP and their upcoming digital single 'Emperors'. A more long-term goal is to amass enough support and experience to write and record a full-length album as the band continues to grow. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Collision+Process">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
