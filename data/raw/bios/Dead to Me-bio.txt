Dead to Me is a punk band from San Francisco. The band formed in 2003, shortly after One Man Army broke up and founding members Jack Dalrymple and Brandon Pollack sought out other SF punks to shore up the lineup of a new band. Jack shares vocal duties with bassist Chicken, who ayed in Western Addiction. Chicken's cousin Ian Anderson is the drummer. Original Guitarist Kyle from Semi-Evolved Simeans left after breaking his ankle on tour, and Nathan joined shortly after. Jack left in 2008 after his wife had their first kid. Dead to Me was a three piece with Chicken, Nathan and Ian, however Nathan left to pursue a solo career.  Sam and Ken joined, making Dead to Me a 4 man band.

In 2006, the band released its debut album, cuban ballerina on Fat Wreck Chords. Many of Dead To Me's songs deal with addiction and recovery (Chicken had recently emerged from rehab), while others address strife around the world (ie. war in Iraq and expanding prison systems). It was produced by Alex Newport, who previously produced records for At the drive-in and the locust. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+to+Me">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
