Impellent and fast, but at the same time melodic and experimental: that is what describes Aetas Obscura’s Black Metal from Tuebingen/Germany the best. This is where hellish blasts with grim riffings clash with spheric melodies and keyboard sound carpets. This mixing of styles does not only succeed Black Metal Heroes like Dimmu Borgir, Naglfar or Nocte Obducta, but it is also flavoured with Iron Maiden and At The Gates.
After an early Demo in 2005, which is already out of stock, and after a change of structures within the band, Aetas Obscura released their first longplayer – War Without End – in early 2009.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aetas+Obscura">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
