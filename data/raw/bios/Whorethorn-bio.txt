Whorethorn are a Black Metal band from the U.K.   Formed as a one man band in 2005 by Malphas, released his first demo that same year.  The first demo contained just two tracks, both of them being ambient/drone pieces, a style scrapped by the band soon after it's release.  

In 2007 Malphas wrote and recorded his second demo entitled "Blood".  This CD contained both tracks from the first demo, plus eight more black metal tracks.  This is the only Whorethorn release to feature a drum machine.  Later this year Malphas was joined by two other members; Krayl and Baal assigned to play drums and bass for the band.
With this new line-up Whorethorn recorded their third and final demo, "Into The Night".  Into The Night was released early 2008.

Midway through 2008 Whorethorn recorded their first full length album, "Under The Veil Of Darkness".   This has recently been released by Salute Records.
