There are more than one bandnamed ARKS.

1) The Windy City's Arks first sailed as a three-piece in 2002, though the band didn't record until 2004's steady Or Else It's Not There EP. These days, Paul Hornschemeier (vocals/guitar), Lanny Oswalt (guitar), Mat Biscan (bass) and Glenn Rischke (drums) take responsibility for the systematically fractured punk racket jutting from the band's first full-length, The International (via Chicago-based imprint, Highwheel Records).
