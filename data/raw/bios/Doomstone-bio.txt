DOOMSTONE was a band that thrives on evil metal! Doomstone accept no imitations and play for only the darkest of souls! They gather inspiration from the true elders of real metal (Venom, Mercyful Fate, Black Sabbath) not from the lame and piss poor 'excuses' for 'darkness' of 'today's' Black Metal scene. They have nothing but black blood pouring through their veins so accept no imitations! As many of you know, Doomstone is yet another project from metal legend KING FOWLEY (DECEASED, OCTOBER 31) and we are humbled to be working with a true icon of the underground and testament to the Metal spirit. Doomstone delivers a sonic history lesson to inform the "kids" that 'evil' does not equate to image and lack of talent! There's "true" black metal, and then  there's "fuck you and the casket you were hauled in on" black metal. Doomstone resides deep in the sinister sounds of the eternal black heart of the 2nd of these 2 and are proud that they have the guts to go against the grain. A storm is coming... and that storm is Doomstone!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Doomstone">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
