TOBC is a one-man band formed in the first half of 2008. The man behind the project is Dominicus who draws influences from everyday life and is inspired by many other bands.

Formerly the band was a multi-genre project which could be associated with various kinds of metal music. Although under the strong influence of many black metal bands like Burzum, Darkthrone or Xasthur, the music of TOBC has changed into more atmospheric, dark yet still aggressive form. This resulted in recording the material for the first album called "Heart Of Darkness" which was released on 14.08.2011 by Kunsthauch & Dunkelkunst. The whole material was created and recorded in 2009.

The main inspiration for TOBC is life and the experience taken from it. The lyrics and music creation process is often triggered by various factors like sadness or anger but also by totally different feelings and experiences, so there are no boundaries for the sound or lyrical themes, however the main subject is the modern world and the feelings towards it. The future sound of TOBC will most likely remain dark, sinister, aggressive or depressive but there will also be some space left for experimentation and progression.
