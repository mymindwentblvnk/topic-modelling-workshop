Infected Disarray is a brutal death metal band from UK. They formed in 2000 as a side project of members of various UK underground bands â€“ Ed (Detrimentum), Rushy (ex-Gorerotted, Detrimentum), Paul (Brainchoke), Lal (DAM) and Steve (ex-7th Child,Gorerotted).  

This line up recorded a 3 song promo in 2001, performed at the second Extinction Agenda festival but disbanded with Lal and Steve leaving. The 2001 promo was later released as part of a 4-way split by Extremist Records in 2003.

The band reformed in 2004 with Tom B and Tom C (both Beef Conspiracy and Twitch Of The Death Nerve) taking over guitar and bass respectively. The debut-full length 'Disseminating Obscenity' was released in April 2009 by Unique Leader. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Infected+Disarray">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
