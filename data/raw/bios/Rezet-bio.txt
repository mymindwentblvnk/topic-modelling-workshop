There is more than one artist with this name:

1. Rezet is a german Thrash- and Speed-Metal band from Schleswig.
It was founded in 2003 by Richard Wagner and Thorben Schulz. After some different line-ups and demo tapes they find their current line-up:
Richard Wagner (guitar and vocals)
Thorben Schulz (guitar)
Sascha Mahrt (bass)
Jens Johannsen (drums).

At first they only play a few gigs in Schleswig-Holstein, but after a short period of time, they play gigs in whole Germany, Belgium and Poland.
Main influences of the group are old thrash- and speedmetalbands from the 80’s.
They chose their bandname because they want to show everyone that old-schooled metal is not dead…
Their current demo tape is called Toxic Avenger and already the fifth released EP since 2004.

2. Rezet was a pop-punk-rock band from Belo Horizonte, state of Minas Gerais in Brazil. It was formed in 2007 and they released their debut and only EP entitled "Entrando no Jogo" ("Entering the game") in 2008. There was a videoclip released for "Não Vai Parar", being well received by the public.
The band dissolved in 2010.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rezet">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
