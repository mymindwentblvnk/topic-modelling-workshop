Emerging from the current small but ever growing Milton Keynes Music Scene. Welcome - Seethe. Five Metal Heads with a collective love of heavy guitar music, a huge amount of respect for the spirit and integrity with which the British underground music community operates and carries itself.

Since 2001 when Seethe were born, the band has worked tiresely and intensely strengthening their sound, releasing two very well received demo's. Constantly gigging in and around Milton Keynes. Thus Building a Fearsome Live Reputation and Loyal, Local Fan base. Seethe's Aggressive Melodic Style is Influenced (but not limited too) Slayer, The Haunted, At The Gates, Killswitch Engage and Hatebreed. 

Seethe have played with such established bands as The Black Dahlia Murder, Born From Pain, Dry Kill Logic, Mendeed, Entombed, Testament, Nile, Maroon, Dying Fetus, Stampin Ground, Biomechanical, Disfear, and The Great Deceiver.

This is about the Music, The Pride and the Passion. No Strings, No Lies, No Bullshit! You have been warned!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seethe">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
