Amusement Parks on Fire are an English shoegaze band from Nottingham.

The band was formed by Michael Feerick in 2004, who wrote and performed their self-titled debut album entirely by himself. The band has since expanded and now write and perform as a five-piece currently composed of Michael Feerick (guitar/vocals), Daniel Knowles (guitar/production), Peter Dale (drums), Gavin Poole (bass) and Joe Hardy (keyboard).

Feerick wrote and recorded ten songs on a minimal budget with close friend Daniel Knowles engineering the sessions. These efforts formed Amusement Parks on Fire's self-titled debut album released in the UK on INVADA Records, a label run by Geoff Barrow of Portishead in 2005.

The band signed to V2 Records in 2005 and went on to record their second studio album Out of the Angeles at Sigur Rós' Sundlaugin studio in Álafoss, Iceland.

The line-up altered to its current state in summer 2006 with the addition of Gavin Poole (Bass) and Joe Hardy (Keyboards). This was followed by a co-headline tour of the UK with US noise outfit Scarling. and a headline tour across mainland Europe and Scandinavia.

The band played in Japan for the first time at the Summer Sonic Festival 2006.

In addition to the second album "Out of the Angeles", the band recorded a series of limited edition 12" EPs — the first of which, "In Flight" was released early in September 2006. This was followed by "A Star Is Born" on the 2nd of April 2007 which was supported by a UK & Ireland headlining tour.

The band recently played a short UK tour and debuted some new material, and are currently in Nottingham recording new material for a possible release in 2008. In addition, they are currently playing some small live shows across the UK and Ireland, and mostly travelling by train. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amusement+Parks+On+Fire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
