Kool G Rap & DJ Polo were an American rapper/DJ duo from Queens, New York. Nathaniel "Kool G Rap" Wilson began working with DJ Polo in 1986, releasing several underground hit singles including "It's a Demo"/"I'm Fly". The duo released their debut album Road to the Riches in 1989, with their sophomore effort Wanted: Dead or Alive being released a year later. Their final album together Live and Let Die was released independently on Cold Chillin' after Warner Bros. refused to release the album due to its lyrical content as well as the controversial album cover. Kool G Rap would go on to have a solid solo career, with the release of his debut 4, 5, 6, as well as his respected guest appearances. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kool+G+Rap+&+DJ+Polo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
