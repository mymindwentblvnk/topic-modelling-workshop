USA (2006 - present)

Vykyng is a rock/entertainment band.  Everything they do is based on comedy G - PG13 rated.  Their music is geared towards kids and adults from 2 years old up to 102. The band formed in very early 2006, produced a full length album titled "Invasion", and performed their first show, on 8/19/06.  Since then, they have sold almost 500 copies of their album worldwide, including shipments to Sweden, Canada, and Finland, just to name a few.  We have also produced a Christmas EP, and have just completed their second full length album, "Steel Brothers Forged In Steel" in 2010.  Vykyng has performed all over the Phoenix metropolitan area, and brings a hilarious 1 hour show to it's listeners. They preform killer heavy metal!
