RIFFLORD was formed in the summer of 2007 with Wyatt Bronc and Tommy Davoux in South Dakota and later joined by Mike Hutch and Tommy Middlen of "Castle". RIFFLORD is known for their love of gear, that is borderline obsession. Lyrical content often references tubes, Hiwatt and Orange Amps. Rifflord has played with many great bands such as The Sword, Jucifer, High On Fire and Admiral Browning.

We are a collective of amp lovers and riff monsters. Upon our tubelifiers we ride with 4x12's stacked upon high. We are the heavy children of electric currency. Drone and riff, goat's meat, EL 34's, giant kicks and two floor toms, booze and thunder.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rifflord">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
