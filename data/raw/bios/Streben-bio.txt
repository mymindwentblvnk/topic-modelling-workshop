"Streben" is the denomination for a philosophic and literary ethic of German Romanticism and it means the anxiety derivated from the attempts of breaking reality's bonds. This word perfectly reflects the musical proposal of this duo (a mix of acoustic melodies and black metal with a dreamful and melancholic feeling), but at the same time is attinent to the general concept behind the project: escaping a dull reality to regain individuality in a more personal dimension. Hagalaz, foundress and mastermind of the project, involved Valker (also in Cold Empire) during the first days of October, 2007; a few weeks later, the duo recruited Cold Empire’s drummer Dark Shadow as a guest musician. In may 2008, Streben released the first demo, entitled "...of Melancholic Elegies and Wanderlust".
Streben is NOT a pagan/heathen/viking band.
