Brutal metal with a soupcon of death, dash of grindcore and just of hint of rot. 

Bukowski Family case history is marred with such atrocities as cannibalism, perverted human dismemberment, general unpleasantness and musical ruthless massacre.

Brace yourselves to see everything you deem precious torn apart and dragged out to the backyard to be burned in a stinking pile of waste. If it is holy to someone, it surely can be defiled.
