Asaradel was a early Brazilian Black/Doom Metal formed in winter 1991. 

In the early stage of Asaradel, the music was slow, primitive and depressive. It reminded of Samael, Necro Schizma, Alastis, Mordor(Switzerland) and Hellhammer. 
Asaradel can be considered a band pioneering both Funeral Doom Metal and Depressive Black Metal however the music got little attention and Asaradel fell into obscurity.

The band featured members of former Brazil Black/Death Metal legend Invoker.

In 1994 Asaradel evolved into a Gothic Metal band and eventually disbanded in the late 90's.
