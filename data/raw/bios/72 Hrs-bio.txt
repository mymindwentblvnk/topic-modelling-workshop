Formed in 2006, 72hrs as a band is relatively new to the metal scene of Nepal. However all of the 5 members have been involved with the other bands before.

George, the drummer, used to slam skin for Refused 13, a band which had gained respect on its own in the then scene. Prateek, the guitarist, used to shred his guitars and vocals for Ugra Karma - one of the bands that laid foundation to the Death Metal scene in Nepal. Rupendra, the bassist, and Dupchen, the vocalist, used to be in a band named Serene, which is one of the older bands only that it was not that popular. Sunil, the guitarist, lended his skills to many bands before joining Rupendra & Dupchen in Serene. So it is a sort of a comeback for the individuals in the band, in the scene with the new lineup.

The band members knew each other before they formed the band. They used to meet in gigs when they were involved with their previous bands. So when Refused 13 went idle, members of Ugra Karma and Serene left the country, the guys gave each other a call and started rehearsing. The lineup worked out and it was then that the guys seriously started to contemplate performing live and recording originals, some of which were composed way before the band was formed.

Since January 2008, Shashank (Guitars) has joined the band.
