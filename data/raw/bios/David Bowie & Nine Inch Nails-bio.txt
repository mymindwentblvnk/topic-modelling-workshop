In 1995 Nine Inch Nails joined David Bowie on "Dissonance", the US leg of his Outside tour as co-headliners. The concerts were structured with NIN playing a full set before being accompanied by Bowie for a number of NIN and Bowie songs. During this time the musicians in the bands changed over, moving seamlessly into Bowie's own set. Footage of them performing Hurt together appeared in Nine Inch Nail's Closure video.

During this period Nine Inch Nails also remixed Bowie's The Hearts Filthy Lesson (Alt. Mix) in '95, and contributed all but one of the Versions on his I'm Afraid Of Americans remix EP in '97. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie+&+Nine+Inch+Nails">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
