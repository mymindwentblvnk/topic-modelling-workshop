Jaldaboath are a medieval themed experimental folk/black metal band, masterminded by Jaldaboath (of Meads of Asphodel fame, real name James Fogarty) along with The Mad Monk a.k.a "The Mad Mullah" on drums and Sir Bodrick on bass. They describe their sound as "Hammering Heraldic Metal", "Crusader-core" or "Tumultuous Teutonic Templar Thrash" and take inspiration from the Knights Templars, the Crusades, Black Adder and Monty Python. 

Their first EP Hark The Herald was released on 23rd April (St George's Day) 2008, which contained 6-tracks. The first batch of orders were also supplied with a parchment detailing the principal knights of the Battle of Hastings. 

Sally forth!
