Vragh, a Serbian black metal band was formed in November 2013. The project is heavily influenced by extreme metal bands of the 90â€™s. Various ideas and pieces have been piling up and brewing for years, slowly taking shape of what was to become Vragh. The band's music has a certain retro feel, but at the same time  incorporates modern tendencies, with a touch of Serbian black metal spice for a unique taste. Lyrical themes deal with darkness, passion, fear, conflicts, life and death, written exclusively in Serbian to deliver a more definitive and exotic atmosphere. Dive deep into 35 minutes of pure and raw metal energy of the debut release ''Iskopan" (Unburried) that will take you on a journey of discovery and fear, salvation and doom.
