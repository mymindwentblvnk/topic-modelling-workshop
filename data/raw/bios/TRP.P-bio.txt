TRP.P (pronounced "trippy") is an R&B duo hailing from Toronto, Canada. Comprised of Truss (producer, singer/songwriter) and Phoenix Pagliacci (singer/songwriter), the dynamic duo met in 2015 and have been collaborating in music and life ever since. In 2017, they released their self-titled debut EP, followed with their sophomore release “2TRP.P” in 2019. The album was very well received and awarded a 9/10 review from Exclaim! Magazine. The lead single, “Love, Calm Down”, was featured on NOW Magazine’s #NOWPlaying playlist on Spotify. Critics have agreed the electric chemistry between Truss and Phoenix infuse their music and emulate love and passion. With two albums under their belt, TRP.P has performed numerous shows and festivals across Canada. During the pandemic the duo have been writing, creating and recording new music, while immersing themselves in virtual concerts until in-person events return. Their 80s/90s R&B inspiration takes a modern twist with powerful lyrics into uncharted topics, celebrating queer love and empowering their communities by brightening a spotlight on injustices and oppression. The pair have also swapped places in producing and songwriting as they expand their repertoire. Their third album is set to be released in June of 2022, with a following tour across North America. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TRP.P">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
