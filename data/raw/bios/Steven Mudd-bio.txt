While his career and skill-set spans a wide range of genres and songwriting styles, Steven's solo piano records (Revoir: Solo Piano & Evoluer: Solo Piano, Glacé: Solo Piano the first 3 of a 5 album set and , Nöel: a Holiday EP) are a return to the style and medium of music that first captivated him
