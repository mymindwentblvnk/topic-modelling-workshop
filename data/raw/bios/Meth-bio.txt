There are two artists named Meth:

1) Meth began his long road into drum n bass 13 years ago. Initially he was playing parties around his local area, a natural want to make beats emerged and Meth started to Produce with good friend Andy- who would become Propaganda, A long term friendship and collaboration that still exists to this day.

Meth met local dnb head Blade whilst dj’ing on the south coast of United Kingdom and alongside Virtua they formed The Sect- signing to Offkey with ‘Nerve Attack’. Numerous releases followed on labels such as offkey ,Position Chrome, Freak & Obscene.

After smashing clubs across the globe with his dj’ing and music made alongside Blade & Virtua, Meth has decided to go solo as an artist. The new focus will be dancefloor smashers, if you have seen Meth’s dj’ing style you’ll know what to expect- Window shattering bass and running drums are the order of the day.

Already Meth’s tracks are being rewound (twice!) internationally and there is much more to come, expect solo tracks, remixes and collaborations with Propaganda, Raiden,audio and others. Meth is now ready to spread his wings as in individual artist and will be an integral part of Offkey music, as a dj his reputation is already secured across the world and now the 2nd wave comes with a new sense of confidence and a bag full new music, things have moved foward with Offkey and its artists and its time for you to be a part of it.

2) Meth is a garage/surf rock artist part of Green Brown Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Meth">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
