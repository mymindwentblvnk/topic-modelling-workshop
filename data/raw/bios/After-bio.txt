2.- AFTER was originally conceived by singer/guitarist Jose Freitas and drummer Brian Santner in the halls of the Los Angeles Music Academy.

Shortly after moving the fledgling project out to Orange County, they were signed to Skullr Records, and released their first demo and subsequent self-titled album.

They quickly exhausted the options available to them in the OC scene, and in 2008 decided to move the band to the epicenter of the music industry: Los Angeles.

A tumultuous couple of years followed as the band underwent numerous lineup changes, but in 2010 they finally started to gain some traction: they hooked up with their manager Don Hamister, released their second album, and pulled off a successful DIY tour.

2011 proved to be the band’s breakout year; they solidified their line-up with Matthew Denis on bass and Brian Sumwalt on drums, and quickly garnering a reputation for awe-inspiring live performances, with standing room only shows at The Viper Room, The Troubadour, and The Roxy Theater.

After crafting some of their most dynamic and musical material to date, they got into the studio with platinum producer Barrett Yeretsian to record their newest release, the appropriately titled ‘Edges of the World’.

With some serious momentum and an excellent team behind them, AFTER is set to hit the ground running in 2012.
