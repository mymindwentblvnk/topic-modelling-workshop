Metal band from Slovakia, originated in the town of Nitra, with dark and heavy sound. Good for listening at home or in a car, same as good for headbanging during live performances.

Influences from death, classical heavy and symphonic metal scenes have formed a really enjoyable music, maybe with a dash of speed in it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Revealing+the+Conscience">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
