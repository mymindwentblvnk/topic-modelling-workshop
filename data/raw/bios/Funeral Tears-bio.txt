Funeral Tears is a funeral doom metal one man band from Tomsk, Russia, created by Nikolay Seredovin in 2007.
So far he released only one album, "Your Life My Death", which is a fairly diverse album by funeral doom standards. It follows the well-worn path left behind by bands such as Thergothon, Worship and Evoken and has all the bleak, depressive atmosphere you would expect from music like this. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Funeral+Tears">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
