Their live performances have garnered attention for their dynamic range and unpredictability, which led metal band Tool to add them as the supporting act on their 2010 North American summer tour.

Their self-titled debut album was released June 18th, 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rajas">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
