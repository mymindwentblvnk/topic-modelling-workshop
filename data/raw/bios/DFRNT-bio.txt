Having discovered Dubstep in 2007, DFRNT jumped at the opportunity to try his hand at production. He had worked on a number of styles in the past, all developing out of his previous production work on mashups and bootlegs. Within a few weeks, he had worked up a furious remix of Dead Prez’s “Hip Hop” and with a solid base of feedback, decided to work on a number of entirely original tracks.

His previous production work under other aliases, (including mixtapes, mashups, unofficial remixes and original production from chill-out stuff, to drum & bass) has seen small success on national radio stations, in podcasts, and in clubs and around the world. Most notably a Saturday night slot on XFM’s ‘The Rinse’ show. It was not however until DFRNT’s dubstep production work surfaced that things started to get serious.

Currently based in Edinburgh, DFRNT produces music, runs the Echodub label, manages Modus magazine, and writes SittingOvation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DFRNT">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
