Skirmish, the bulldozer of heavy metal, was founded 2005 in Kajaani, Finland. Their upcoming debut album, "Through the Abacinated Eyes" will be released by legendary Violent Journey Records. The album has been recorded, mixed and mastered in D-Studio, Finland by Jarno HÃ¤nninen.

Based on past releases, people have tried to chain Skirmish inside genre limits, such as death or thrash metal, but the bands driving force has been to stay outside of categories and to rather make good music in a tight leaning position.
