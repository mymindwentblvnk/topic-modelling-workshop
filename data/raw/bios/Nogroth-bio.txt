One day in the beautiful Kulmbach, Weeman and Raoul came together to set up a Black Metal band ... After some tinkering, the bandmembers were choosen (guitar, drums, bass, vocals). Shortly afterwards Weeman left the band, since he stated that he could not achieve his goals (yet at the same time, the song of the battle horn call was originated). Therefore we decided to change the band's style. The next step was to play a new instrument! And thus entered Lukas (on keyboards) the band. In January 2007, it was time, Nogroth leaves the rehearsal room and play on the Burn The Ice Festival
