Christian and Kebu are kouzins, and used to record and compose a lot of silly tunes when they were kids. In the beginning of 2007, the grown up musicians decided to start collaborating again. By a coincident Stefan, Christian's brother, had for the first time tried to record some vocals to one of Christian's tunes. This was the birth of Kouzin Bedlam, resulting in three songs.

During the summer of 2008 the three kouzins jammed AC/DC songs live on a private party, after which an intensive record session followed, resulting in eight additional songs. Plans for live shows ignited and soon the kouzins were joined by a powerful rythm section, consisting of Hans and Skogge. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kouzin+Bedlam">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
