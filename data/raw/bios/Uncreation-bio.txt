1) Brutal Death Metal band from Spain.  Years active: 1991-1993 (as Worm's Grocery), 1993-2000, 2010-present 

2)  Uncreation (Germany) was created in November 2003, in order to carry out the common vision of modern melodic Death Metal. 
The mainly thrashig shaped sound developed itself further since the beginning constantly and received ever more facets: Lead and rhythm guitars are merged, acoustic passages change themselves with one another off with driving reef and alternating Soli of both guitarists. 
In February 2005 the first demo was taken up in the Hamburger "Fat Pound of sound Studio" and finished in an edition of 150 pieces. 
The pertinent Songs can already be listened, or even downloaded on our myspace. 
However Uncreation see themselves as a live band and they get more and more popular in the underground of Hamburg. 
Past highlights are the gig in december 2005 as support of "Disillusion" and the gig as support of "Dark Age" in april 2006 
Uncreation work nonstop on new Songs and want to get shows beyond Hamburg. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Uncreation">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
