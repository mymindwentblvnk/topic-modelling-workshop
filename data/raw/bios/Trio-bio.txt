1. Trio was a minimalist new wave band that was formed in 1979 in the small town of Großenkneten, Germany. The group is best known for the 1982 worldwide hit single "Da Da Da I Don't Love You You Don't Love Me Aha Aha Aha" (often also known as just "Da Da Da"). The band consisted of Stephan Remmler (vocals), Gert "Kralle" Krawinkel (guitar), and Peter Behrens (drums). 

The band was produced by former Beatles associate Klaus Voormann, who also played bass on some songs.  Considered part of the "Neue Deutsche Welle" (often abbreviated as "NDW") movement, the band reportedly preferred the name "Neue Deutsche Fröhlichkeit", which means "New German Cheerfulness", to describe their music. Although achieving a significant burst of international fame, various pressures proved too much for the musicians, and the band broke up in 1985.

2. TRIO (short for "The.Rhythm.Is.Odd", which the group is often known as) is a progressive rock band with an experimental, often psychedelia-based sound that was formed in Stockholm, Sweden September in 2006. The project was devised by famous Swedish drummer Leif Fredriksson together with bassist Bjorn Egelius and musician Tobbe Johanson, the latter of which handles both guitar and vocals. Their debut album, titled From Nowhere To Eternity, came out in October 2008.

3. A Maldivian band which is really popular in Maldives for the song 'Chaaley'.

4. A French trio, all of whom played synthesizers and two of whom played violin and cello on some works. Their work is rare but can be found free download at www.avantgardeproject.org.
The Avant Garde Project is a series of 20th-century classical-experimental-electroacoustic torrents digitized from LPs whose music has in most cases never been released on CD, and so is effectively inaccessible to the vast majority of music listeners today. This is wild stuff, so check it out if you've never heard this sort of music before. The analog rig used to extract the sound from the grooves is near state-of-the-art, producing almost none of the tracking distortion or surface noise normally associated with LPs. 

AGP1-43 are now available for direct download in the archive at www.avantgardeproject.org

=======================================

AGP48 features the work of a French trio, all of whom play synthesizers and two of whom play violin and cello on some works. They play works by trio members as well as Philippe Mion and Bernard Parmegiani, as well as collaborative compositions. The six tracks of this installment comprise all but one of the tracks on a 2LP set on INA-GRM records. The last track, by Bernard Parmegiani, will be included in AGP49. 

My personal favorite track is 05, by Philippe Mion. His sense of rhythm is reminiscent of L'Image …conduite (AGP5), as is the fugal structure he achieves through the overlapping of reiterated sound elements with gradual development in the course of the composition. The timbres are more limited in this work, but still enjoyable. 

The recording and pressing of this installment is basically flawless. The torrent includes a text file with the English language notes from the set.
