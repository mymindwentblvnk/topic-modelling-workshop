There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Scooter is a German group, formed by Sören Bühler, Hans-Peter Geerdes, Hendrik Stedler, and Jens Thele, in Hamburg, Germany in 1994. Among their more well known hits are 'Ramp! (The Logical Song)', 'Move Your Ass', 'Fire', 'How Much Is The Fish?', 'Nessaja' and 'Weekend!'.

Originally the group started as a side project in 1994. Their debut single Vallée De Larmes (French for Valley Of Tears) reached #8 on the German dance chart. In April of that year, Scooter played their first live show in Hamburg, Germany, where vocalist Hans-Peter Geerdes began freestyling off the top of his head to an instrumental dance track. At that point, Scooter officially became a group, and Geerdes' rapping would become one of the band's trademarks together with the fact that they all of their tracks are in fact remixes, though often with different titles than the original tracks.

In 2002, Scooter enjoyed somewhat of a comeback, with 6 top twenty UK singles ('RAMP! (The Logical Song)', 'Nessaja', 'Posse (I Need You On The Floor)', 'Weekend!', "The Night', and 'Maria (I Like It Loud)') all charting in an 18 month period (prior to this comeback, they only ever had one top twenty single in the UK, 'Back In The UK').

They have a sort of 'trademark' style of dance, with most of their songs featuring some "rap shouting", sometimes featuring a high pitched vocal, which is evident especially on their biggest hit 'RAMP! (The Logical Song)' (which samples 'The Logical Song' by Supertramp). Much of their music features elements of a live performance, including the roar of the crowd, and the echoing sound of Geerdes' voice. 

Scooter's style would also appear to harp back to that of The KLF, especially so with the track entitled "Posse! (I Need You On The Floor) - with a sample which recurrs throughout the work of The KLF. KLF references are also frequently used in Scooter songs. Both bands have released singles with the title "Fuck the Millennium": KLF in 1997 under the pseudonym 2K, and Scooter in 1999. Relatively lenghty and complex samples used in KLF tracks have often surfaced in Scooter tracks, such as the entire opening seconds of the KLF's 3am Eternal being used to open Hello (Good to be Back) by Scooter.

The current band members are: H.P. Baxxter, Michael Simon, and Bastian van Shield (Sebastian Schilde). Former band members were Ferris, Axel Coon, Jay Frog, Rick J. Jordan, and Dirty Disco Youth (Phil Speiser).

They had the song Cranky American on Green Eggs and Hamilton, released in 1997, and in the same year covered Platypus by The Clean on the tribute album God Save the Clean (FNCD409).

In 1998 they released a self titled debut EP (Scooter), including the songs Dayroom and Maybe and toured the country from end to end in support of the EP's release. Dayroom and Maybe appeared on the promo CDs NZ on Air Indie Hit Disc 6 and 7, respectively, in 1998.
