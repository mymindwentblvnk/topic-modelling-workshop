Emerging in early 2001, Vanquished executes a raw blend of severe and atmospheric black metal out of Vancouver BC, Canada. Enduring many line up changes throughout the bands perseverance, original members Grimnyr (guitar/vocals), and Dertah (guitar/vocals) have remained intact with Luzifaust joining the band in 2006 on drums. Lyrical themes consist of catastrophic punishment from the earth onto the lands of mankind in ancient times of austerity and battle.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vanquished">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
