The Puppini Sisters are a musical trio based in England specializing in 1940s-style close harmony vocal music. Currently composed of Italian Marcella Puppini, English Emma Smith (from 2013) and Kate Mullins, their sound has been described as "swing-punk," as it is louder and more in-your-face than traditional swing music. The girls are quipped to have "harmonies so tight you could bounce a baby off them". 

The group was founded in 2004 by Puppini after she was inspired by the 2003 animated film Les Triplettes de Belleville. The Puppini Sisters' debut single, "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy", is a cover of the iconic hit single by The Andrews Sisters, and although the three are not actually related, they named themselves in tribute to them. 

Puppini first studied fashion design at St. Martins School of Art, and later music at Trinity College of Music where she met Mullins and Rosanna Schura, who was later replaced by Stephanie O'Brien. The Sisters are currently supported by a three-piece band featuring the talents of Blake Wilner on guitar, Peter Ibbetson on drums/percussion and Henrik Jensen on upright bass.

The Puppini Sisters won a Gold Disc for international sales of their first CD, Betcha Bottom Dollar, in 2007. According to their official website, the album reached #2 on the US Jazz Charts and #9 on the US New Artist Chart.

Their second album The Rise & Fall of Ruby Woo was released on October 15th 2007, featuring classic covers, 1940s style reworkings of contemporary music, and a selection of original compositions. According to Billboard's official website, the album peaked at #5 in the US Jazz Charts in 2008.

The Puppini Sisters' retro-styled website won the 2008 Cream of Yorkshire awards "Gold Award" for best website.
