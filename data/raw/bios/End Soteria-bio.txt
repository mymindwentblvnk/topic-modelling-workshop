End Soteria hail from the fine backwater of Norwich, the inbreeding capital of our fair country.

Delivering meaty beats, they pride themselves on melodic, heavy tunes, toilet humour and their appreciation of SKOL.

Formed in 2007 by a group of like-minded musicians focused on making good music. The band have exploded onto the scene establishing themselves as a potent live force, delivering a powerful, tight performance designed to do one thing and one thing only, Entertain.

The band has seen more line up changes in its short (but illustrious) existence, than the West End chorus line of Riverdance, but are now fully set and ready to bring the ruckus to every roadside cafe toilet, near and far (just ply us with beer and we'll be happy).

The question is, 'Are you Ready?'

Because we aren't.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/End+Soteria">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
