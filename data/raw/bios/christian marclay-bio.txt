Christian Marclay is a DJ, VJ, visual artist, audio artist and turntablist. 

He is the first non-hip-hop artist (after John Cage) to make an art form out of the turntable, treating the instrument as a means to rip songs apart, not bridge them together. His work demonstrates the effect sounds and music have on us from the sublime tap tap tap of a foot on the floor to the bombastic crescendo of an orchestra. 

A long-time associate of Downtown improv figures John Zorn, Elliott Sharp, and Butch Morris as well as the Kronos Quartet, Marclay was inspired artistically by Joseph Beuys and musically by John Cage and the Fluxus group after a period studying at the Massachusetts College of Art. He has released albums and his sound and visual pieces have been exhibited in art galleries worldwide. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Christian+Marclay">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
