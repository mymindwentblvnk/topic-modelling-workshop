METALFIER is a NYC Heavy Metal band formed by Andrew Janda (guitars/vocals/composer). Our mission is to transform everyone into a Metalhead.
When you listen to Metalfier you get the sense that these guys love Metal. Not just the music but also the lifestyle. Their anthemic style takes you back to the 80's style Judas Priest and Metallica played. 
Metalfier's line up is:
Andrew Janda - Guitars/Vocals
Jorge Styrtet - Drums
Reda Woodcock - Bass <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Metalfier">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
