The band:
Five experienced musicians aged between 25 and 33 years have found together in 2009 to become DREADLINK. From the beginning DREADLINK was meant to be more than a band – it became a philosophy.

The music:
DREADLINK is rough, authentic and intense, sounding more like an angry machine than a common metal band. Musically DREADLINK walk between brutal, grooving parts and melodic, melancholic parts who have unbelievable haunting melodies. The band focuses on good songwriting and recognition and less on technical gaming – the song is what matters.

The intentions:
DREADLINK is a philosophy . It is meant to be shared by as many people as possible and they are ready now with their debut being released by Massacre Records soon!
