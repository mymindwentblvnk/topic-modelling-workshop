Shades of Avalon fuse the aggressive vocals of death metal with powerful grooves and a potent sense of melody. 

The twin lead guitars and counterpointing basslines collide with monstrous drum beats, creating a wall of fist pumping, battle-primed metal that assaults the audience, whilst retaining memorable hooks throughout.

The lyrics draw inspiration from British legend & heritage, from celtic pagan warriors to viking invaders and beyond - historical battles are relayed, wars are relived and odes to honour, pride and bravery are invoked.

THE NORTHERN BARBARIANS ARE:
Tobias Gray - Vocals/Guitar
Kieran Mackinnon - Guitar
Paul Taylor - Bass
Dan Barham - Drums
