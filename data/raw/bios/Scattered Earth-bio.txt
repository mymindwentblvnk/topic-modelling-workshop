Beginning in late 2007, the seeds for Scattered Earth were planted as just a conversation between friends on the way home from a concert. Slowly, unsteadily, but surely, the pieces came together to form what they are today. Determined to give a well-needed gasp of fresh air to a scene polluted with all the clichés of modern music, Scattered Earth take a page from the classic bands they grew up on rather than their contemporaries. With aesthetics and trends out of the way, the music they create is pure and from the heart. Be it tranquil, melodic passages or feedback-drenched sonic assaults, the key ingredient to their sound is passion. The band released their first demo, entitled “To Suffer…” in January 2010 and are currently focused on playing shows and continuing to write music for a full-length album in the imminent future.
