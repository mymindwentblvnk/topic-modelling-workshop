Black metal with a melancholic touch from Austria. 

from official myspace:

The music of Obscure Anachronism can most aptly be described as utterly devoted trance-inducing black metal that is performed with utmost passion and dedication. Dare to let your pity egos be totally consumed by the composition..s otherworldy emanations and thus rid yourself of the illusions of this worthless world. And as opposed to a myriad of bands that neglect lyrics totally because of them lacking any worthwhile visions Obscure Anachronism do indeed have something to say as well. Their lyrics penned in essay-form have been praised by many for their appealing subtlety and the philosphical touch. The topics the lyrics deal with are how it feels to be completely alienated from the environment that surrounds you, visions of unworthy people's extinction and profound meditations about death.
