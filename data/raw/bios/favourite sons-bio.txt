"This band exists to talk about the things you go through when you confront the big stuff: love, regret, fear," says Ken Griffin, the singer and principal songwriter of Favourite Sons. "Weve all been right to that edge, pushed through it and now we're back to show people the other side, as brutal as it might be."

There are so many apologetic undertones hidden in the way bands play nowadays, says Werth. This is not that at all. This is something right from the battlefield.

Please note that this band must not be confused with The Favourite Sons, a 1960s freakbeat group that has featured on compilations of sixties freakbeat and proto-psychedelic beat. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Favourite+Sons">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
