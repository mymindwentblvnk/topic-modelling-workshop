There are 4 bands called Doomsday.

1. After 10 years, world-reknowned Purification, a band highly popular within the vegan straight edge underground (Earth Crisis, Path of Resistance, Undying, Maroon, Arkangel) that has released records and played literally all over the world, calls it quits, but former guitarist and songwriter Monster decides to start a brandnew band which he calls DOOMSDAY.

The band decides to sign with Good Life, the label that first unleashed bands like Avenged Sevenfold, Poison The Well, 100 Demons, As Friends Rust, Morning Again, and many others upon an unsuspecting world.
