Malisha is a female fronted epic/heavy metal band from Los Angeles. The singer of the group is Kim La Chance, who also sang in the tremendous "Made in Hawaii" of Vixen (HI). Their only LP "Serve Your savage beast" is a real gem for every fan of classic metal sounds. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malisha">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
