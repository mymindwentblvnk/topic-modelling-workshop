More than one artist use this name:

1) Liam Sullivan began his act in a golden wig and a leather jacket as Kelly in Santa Monica, California at O'Brien's, with two songs, Shoes and Let Me Borrow That Top. The response was overwhelming, so Kelly set to work on a music video for Shoes. That video went viral on YouTube and on Myspace; receiving over 53 million views on YouTube, as of 2014, with little to no promotion. To satisfy the demand for her material, "Kelly" released an album, Shoes.

2) One part of French electropunky duo Off the Latch.

3) Dutch Big Brother part three contester Kelly (van der Veer) become the best known transsexual of The Netherlands after telling her "boyfriend" that she used to be a boy. Probably the only BB-contester who remained a kind of "Bekende Nederlander" (Famous Dutch) after the program ended. She recorded a single "I am what i am" and no it wasn't a cover of the Gloria Gaynor song.
