Saturnalia Temple is the musical potion born from ages spent in occult strife. Inspired by diabolic inner experiences, encounters with Qliphotic energies and entities, psychedelic trips and the Northern climate. Musically deep down in the late sixties/early seventies Black Magic Rock, heavy metal, psychedelia and deep stuff. The band was first conceived by Tommie, who wished to return to musical roots, who invited drummer Paul and guitarist Konstantin. Bass player Peter was accepted into the temple in March 2008. Our first demo UR was released during 2007, received several outstanding reviews, and has just been released as a cassette by Nuclear Winter Records, to be followed by a 7 vinyl ep in the autumn. In September 2008, renown doom label Psychedoomelic (Ramesses, Reverend Bizarre etc) was chosen to release UR as a digipack cd.
