House of Low Culture is a musical project, formed in 2000 (?), from Los Angeles, California which is fronted by Aaron Turner, and includes other members of the band Isis. The ensemble also includes Stephen O'Malley from Sunn O))) and Luke Scarola from Old Man Gloom.

House of Low Culture marries warm cinematic tones with sub-nautical sound effects to produce an aural encounter, both vaguely disorienting and starkly captivating. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/House+of+Low+Culture">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
