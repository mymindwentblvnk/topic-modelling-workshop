Fuckfest came about when Nick quit Goratory in 2001 and wanted to do a ridiculous but brutal slam death project. Chris of Zircon joined Nick on vocals and guitar. A foolish yet brutal EP was soon recorded called "275,000 Ways To Violate Your Orifices". The main subject matter is vagina, and how much some people are total fags.

On his own, Nick recorded a couple Christmas tracks -  "Jingle Bells" and "God Left Dismembered Gentlemen" - for a yet-unreleased EP to be entitled "JOY IS FOR FAGGOTS" - all in capitals. It's an ongoing work. It may never be released. You'll live. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fuckfest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
