Murdryck began life in 1999 as a Blackened Dark Ambient project.

In 2014 the band was rejuvenated and began its journey as a Black Metal band since the original roots of the music were based in black ambient.

Murdryck is now semi-melodic, necro inspired, fast-paced Black Metal band and will look to play live gigs soon. https://murdryck.bandcamp.com/ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Murdryck">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
