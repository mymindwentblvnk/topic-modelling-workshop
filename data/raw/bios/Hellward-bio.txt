Hellward,the one-member old school Chinese black metal band  officially joined Dying Art in 2006. Its works,which mixed the dual features of NWOBHM and traditional hard rock,was unique among nowadays black metal. As the only member,Bloodfire did all the composing,playing, recording and mastering,and expressed his respect to all the old metal heroes that were active in the golden era of 1980s.

Bringing the fans back to the age of chaos that extreme metal was newly born by its first album Heavy Fvckn Black, Hellward explores the source of black metal that was differentiated from the heavy metal new wave.Containing lots of early thrash/traditional metal and hard rock elements, Hellward's songs appear very old-school like,and a listener can easily tell the influences of Motorhead,Tygers of Pan Tang, Bathory (early years), Sodom (early years),Destroyer 666 etc.on it.Heavy Fvckn Black does not belong to this blundering today,but to that glorious past!!!
