It is also an atmospheric black metal band from Bled region, formed in July 2012 by Tilen Å imon. The quintessence of Bled nature is the source of Veldes' dark and majestic audible shape entwined with somber lyricism.

- Skyward EP (2014)
- Split with Black Autumn (2015) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Veldes">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
