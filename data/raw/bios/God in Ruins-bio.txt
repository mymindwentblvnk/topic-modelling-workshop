God in Ruins is a metal band formed in the year 2000 in Poland, but its origins go back to 1996 as it had existed before and done some gigs under the names of Incarnatus and Gorenhaatad. God in Ruins performs a mixture of black, death, thrash and heavy metal music. They recorded a couple of demo tapes and promo stuff and one of them, "Agony of the Fallen Gods," was released by a small label called Apocalypse Productions. God in Ruins split up in 2003 but they come back now in 2008 with six brand new tracks that will be soon available on a mini LP entitled "Reptilian." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/God+in+Ruins">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
