Tim Knol (born Hoorn, The Netherlands, 12 September 1989) is a Dutch singer-songwriter, who emerged from the pub singer/songwriter scene of his home town to release one of the most succesful and critically acclaimed Dutch début albums of 2010, the eponymous Tim Knol.

Locally, he made an impression with the band Be Right Back in which he sang and played guitar. He left the band in the spring of 2009. Knol first gained popularity in the year prior to his official début, as the support-act of indie band Johan, who also emerged from the town of Hoorn and are on the same record label as Knol, the prestigious Excelsior Recordings.

Knol recorded his eponymous début album with the help of label mate Anne Soldaat, who also plays guitar in Knol's live band. It was released in January 2010, to overwhelming critical acclaim. 

Excelsior Recordings re-released the album as a 2CD set in November 2010. The second disc, entitled Music In My Room contains nine acoustic versions of songs from the début album. Knol's second studio album, Days came out in May 2011, yet again to rave reviews from the Dutch music press.

Knol's third and fourth full-length studio records, Soldier On (release: November 2013) and Cut The Wire (January 2018), mark a shift towards indie guitar pop with more of a 'band sound'. 

Knol also recorded a punk-inspired album with his band The Miseries and a bluegrass album with Blue Grass Boogiemen (see Tim Knol & Blue Grass Boogiemen). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Knol">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
