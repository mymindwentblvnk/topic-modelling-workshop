Exotherm convinces with dynamic and varying songs and vocals full of mutability that cover everything from melancholic passages to aggressive shouts. Traditional Heavy, Power and Thrash Metal meet influences from several other Metal genres and some modern elements, but always without being nu-metal, so the diversified songs and the catchy tunes appeal to a big audience.

Singer Georg is a real entertainer, who lets the audience become a part of the show while on stage there is really something going on. Guitar player Alex with his scream cares for additional hardness and
when the Band send up the temperature in the club by several degrees, everyone knows that Exotherm can set free a lot of energy in the audience. And that is where the band's name comes from.

Exotherm was formed in 1998 by Alexander Braikrats (guitar, vocals), Christian
Pirch (guitar), Nikolas Müller (bass) and Pascal Azzolin (drums) in Wipperfürth
(40km east of Köln / Cologne, Germany). Georg Laudenberg joined 1999 with his amazing voice and his gift to move the audience.

The album "project 47" was released worldwide by the label "Limited Access Records" and there will be a new album in early 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Exotherm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
