A short-lived black metal project by two Novembre members Giuseppe Orlando and Puccio (Fabio Vignati, ex-Novembre member). In Deum Maledicus was formed in 1994 and their sole release was the "Acies" EP, recorded in two days (15th/16th) in January 1995. Released by Cysboileed Productions, it contained 2 lenghty songs of atmospheric and melodic black metal and an outro. A second miniCD was supposed to follow but it was never released.

The "Acies" EP seems to be the only release of "Cysboileed Productions" which leads one to think it was just the band members who released the EP under that monicker. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+Deum+Maledicus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
