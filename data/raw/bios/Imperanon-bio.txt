Imperanon was a Melodic Death Metal band from Finland. The band was formed in 1999 by Jaakko Nyland and Asko Sartanen. They were joined by Aleksi Sihvonen and Eki Nurmikari and recorded their first demo in 2002, titled Until The End. After this, Sartanen left the band to be replaced by Aleksi Virta and Lauri Koskenniemi. A further demo was recorded (called Imperanon) before the band signed to Nuclear Blast Records. Their debut album Stained was released in 2004, after which Koskenniemi left the band, to be replaced by Teemu Mäntysaari.

In 2005, the band recorded a three song demo. However, this demo was never released to the public, and is not included on discographies. In 2006, Imperanon released a yet another demo, known only as 2006 Demo and having no cover art. On July 20th, 2007, the band issued a statement via MySpace announcing that they had broken up and gone their separate ways, most likely due to Teemu Mäntysaari's dedication to Wintersun and Aleksi Sihvonen's joining of the Finnish Death/Thrash band Medicated.
