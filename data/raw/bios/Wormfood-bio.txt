France's Wormfood plays a style similar to the "dark metal" sound of Bethlehem. Death metal, doom metal, and black metal influences topped-off by keyboard symphonics comprise their sound. Their latest album, France, also uses folk and traditional French influences.

From 2006 to september 2007, some members of the band joined Carnival In Coal's live line-up. In 2011, Emmanuel LÃ©vy formed The Lovotics with former Carnival in Coal member Axel Wursthorn. 

Their former drummer Alexis Damien founded Pin-Up Went Down.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wormfood">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
