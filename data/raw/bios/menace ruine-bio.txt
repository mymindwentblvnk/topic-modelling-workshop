Menace Ruine began in 2006, following several other collaborative projects between the Montreal-based duo of S. de la Moth and Geneviève. Over the course of four albums and an EP they have forged a unique and idiosyncratic sound, constructed from vast, distorted, yet always melodic textures and the imposing voice and songwriting of Geneviève. MR recorded two CDs for Montreal's Alien8 Recordings (later reissued on vinyl by Transcendental Creations) and a cassette on Tour de Garde. These were followed up in 2010 by 'Union of Irreconcilables', a CD and double LP on UK imprint Aurora Borealis, and a very limited 3" CDr, 'Sigil Sessions', on Luchtrat of Belgium.

MR have played live extensively in Canada and the US, sharing stages with artists as diverse as Francisco López, Nadja, Daniel Menche, Wolf Eyes and Watain. They conducted their first European tour in the spring of 2011 with French group Aluk Todolo, including an appearance at Holland's Roadburn festival, where they were invited by 2011 curators Sunn 0))).

In the past year, the members of MR have been very busy; Geneviève's other group Preterite released their debut CD last fall on Handmade Birds, and recorded their second during the winter. S has produced several cassettes with his new project S/V\R, the latest also released by Handmade Birds. Parallel to all this, a new Menace Ruine album is in the works, to be released on vinyl by Sige Records, and on CD by Profound Lore. The new album promises to be their most ambitious recording to date, combining the graceful melodicism of 2008's 'The Die is Cast' with near-symphonic structures and powerful rhythms.
