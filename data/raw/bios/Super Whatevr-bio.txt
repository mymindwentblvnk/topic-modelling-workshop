Super Whatevr was a band from 2016 to 2021.

An Orange County emo-punk quartet, Super Whatevr emerged in 2016 with a raw, cathartic, yet tuneful sound that channels the spirit of early-2000s indie rock.

Raised in northern California, singer/guitarist Skyler McKee started out in the hardcore scene there, acting as a bit player in several bands but secretly writing his own songs. Later he moved south to L.A., where he had a spell in the band THRDVSN, working with pop producer Rob Kinelski. The combination of punk and pop influences informed his own songwriting. Moving to Huntington Beach in Orange County, he found an accepting alternative scene open to a blend of styles. There, a friend encouraged him to record his own songs, and he set about putting a band together, recruiting guitarist Robert Rutan, bassist Thomas Waale, and drummer Luke Mensink. Together with the band's persistent live presence, Super Whatevr's self-released debut EP, Good Luck, gained them a sizeable fan base and attracted the attention of Hopeless Records, which signed them in 2017 and re-released their EP. Their debut full-length for the label, Never Nothing, arrived early in 2018. The band enlisted Courtney Ballard (Good Charlotte, Waterparks) to produce their sophomore full-length effort, 2020's Don't You Wanna Be Glad? <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Super+Whatevr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
