There are several bands called Dark Cell throughout the world:

1) Dark Cell is a melodic death metal band from Hertfordshire in the UK. They formed in 1999 under the name "Beyond the Threshold" but changed to avoid confusion with a similarly-named band in the area. Under the name Dark Cell, they recorded their first demo, a double-A side release of the tracks "Promised Land" and "Evilution". The demo was released as a CDr; both tracks were produced by Tony Pettitt (Fields of the Nephilim, NFD). 

Although their early material was predominantly dark metal in sound and aesthetic (albeit with a heavy groove influence), Dark Cell shaped their music into a more driven, melodic form with the "Curse Ones" promo and the full length album "Strange Days and Dulcet Tones", produced by Alex "Nod" Wright (Fields of the Nephilim).

Dark Cell have played many notable venues in the North London area, sharing the stage with bands including Kill II This, Gilla Bruja, and the legendary Budgie.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Cell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
