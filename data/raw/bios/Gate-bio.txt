There are multiple artists by the name of Gate:

1.) Michael Morley is a rock and experimental musician from New Zealand. Morley sings and plays guitar as a member of The Dead C, but also records on his own (and with collaborators) as Gate. Earlier, in the 1980's, Morley was a member of Wreck Small Speakers On Expensive Stereos. Morley founded the Precious Metal label sometime in the late 1980's to document, first on cassette and later LP and CD, his own work as Gate. Most of the releases on Precious Metal were limited to very small quantities. Morley is also a visual artist and teaches at Otago Polytechnic School of Art in Dunedin."

2.) A Japanese grindcore band.

3.) A Czech metal band. Disbanded and revived as Gate of Sorrow in 2006.

4.) A German prog rock band from the late 1970s. Some of its members were Greek. Released two albums in 1977: "Live" and "Red Light Sister".

5.) Free music / noise project from Tokyo, Japan. Officially named |˟˟| (and pronounced as 'gate'), but MP3s of music by |˟˟| are tagged as 'Gate' by some sellers.

6.) When the name of the norwegian folk-rock band Gåte is written the wrong way.

7.) Small American Rock band from Lexington Kentucky. Came out with one album called Eye for an Eye.

8.) GATE was an minimalist, death-obsessed post-black metal side-project featuring the members of Have A Nice Life, from Connecticut. It is the antidote to modern hardcore: four chords, fast, sinister screams and evil words. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
