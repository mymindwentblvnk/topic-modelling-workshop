History:

TRAUMATIC VOYAGE

UNADULTERATED TRAUMATIC SINCE 1986...
AND STILL THE VOYAGE CONTINUES...

TRAUMATIC VOYAGE IS NO USUAL BAND AT ALL. IT'S MORE SOMEKIND OF A DARK ART-PROJECT, THE INTENSE SELF-EXPRESSION OF A EXTRAORDINARY ARTIST: ASTORIAN! 
AND SINCE 2001, WHEN HIS WIFE UNIKHANYA HAVE JOINED THE "BAND", TRAUMATIC VOYAGE HAS BECAME THE SPIRIDUAL COALESCENCE OF THOSE TWO UNCOMMON MINDS TO CREATE EVEN MORE INTENSE ART THAN EVER BEFORE  
TRAUMATIC VOYAGE ARE ASTORIAN & UNIKHANYA TRAUMATURGOS! EVERY TRAUMATIC VOYAGE-OUTPUT IS A COMPLETE ART-CONCEPT. MUSICK, LYRICS, PHOTOS, PICTURES AND VIDEOCLIPS ARE CREATED BY ASTORIAN AND HIS WIFE UNIKHANYA ON THEIR OWN. SO THAT THEIR VISIONARY ART STAYS PURE AND ALL FIT TOGETHER AS ONE IMMENSE MASTERPIECE OF BLACK ART. 
ASTORIAN & UNIKHANYA ARE LIVING THEIR TRAUMATIC VOYAGE AS A OWN UNUSUAL LIFE-STYLE AND SELF-THERAPY TO DECREASE THE PRESSURE OF DARK VISIONS AND NEGATIVE EMOTIONS INSIDE OF THEM, WHICH THIS HUMAN HELL, WE'RE ALL LIVE IN, PRODUCES TOO MUCH. 
AS THE NAME SAYS: TRAUMATIC VOYAGE IS A MUSICKAL JOURNEY THAT REFLECTS EXISTENCE AS A TRAUMATIC VOYAGE ITSELF. THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER FAKE-IMAGE, IT'S THE FACE OF THE TRUTH THAT NOBODY WANTS TO SEE. THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF TRAUMATIC VOYAGE IS BASED ON ASTORIANS & UNIKHANYAS ENDLESS QUEST FOR THE FINAL, COSMIC TRUTH AND WHAT THEY DISCOVER DURING THEIR SEARCH. TRAUMATIC VOYAGE IS FAR BEYOND OF EVERYTHING YOU THINK TO KNOW. IN A WORLD OF FAKES AND LIES, TRUTH CAN ONLY BE FOUND ON A TRAUMATIC VOYAGE. 
HOW SERIOUS DO YOU WANT IT?
THIS IS DEADLY SERIOUS!
CAN YOU TAKE IT?

STATIONS OF A TRAUMATIC VOYAGE

OVERTURE:

1970: "THE PAIN OF BIRTH"
ASTORIAN ENTERS HUMAN HELL. 
THROUGH FLESH AND BLOOD HE 
APPEARS IN THIS RAPED AND 
DYING WORLD.

1978-1982:  
"A SOUL ARRIVES/FIRST POSSESSION"
SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS AWAKES, 
ASTORIANS SPIRIT SPREADS HIS 
WINGS AGAIN AND RISES FROM THE 
ASHES TO CONTINUE HIS JOURNEY. 
FIRST CONTACT WITH METAL-MUSIC 
(BLACK SABBATH, IRON MAIDEN, 
VENOM...) CAUSES A LIFELONG 
POSSESSION OF ASTORIANS MIND 
BY THE POWER OF METAL.

1983: "A WAY WAS CHOSEN"
ASTORIAN LEARNS HIS FIRST 
INSTRUMENT (GUITAR) AND 
STARTS HIS PERSONAL 
ART-REBELLION AGAINST HIS 
OWN RACE.

1984-1985: 
"GIVING LIFE A MEANING"
THE FIRST WAVE OF BLACK METAL 
(BATHORY, CELTIC FROST, 
POSSESSED...) BREAKS OVER 
ASTORIAN AND PUSHES HIM 
INTO HIS FINAL, MUSICAL 
MAIN-DIRECTION.

THE TRAUMATIC VOYAGE BEGINS:

1986: "INSPIRED BY INSANITY"
ASTORIAN CREATES THE 
CONCEPT (BAND) TRAUMATIC 
VOYAGE TO FOLLOW HIS OWN 
UNCOMPARABLE VISION OF  
EXTREME METAL AS AN ARTFORM 
AND A WAY OF LIFE.

THE POSSIBILITIES.
