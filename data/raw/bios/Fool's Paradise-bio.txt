Fool’s Paradise was created in 2007. Its founding member, Olivier, started writing a few songs influenced by the New Wave of Heavy Metal and as from 2009 the band started playing gigs on the local scene in the North of France. In 2014, they released their first EP ‘Forest of Lies’ with four classic heavy metal tunes. Following this, they decided to write material aimed at a larger audience by adding progressive elements to their music. Some of the songs became longer and incorporated atmospheric orchestral parts that gave another dimension to their music. This artistic leaning led to the release of their debut album called ‘Monopoly Society’. The album features straight-forward heavy music as well as longer and deeper pieces while drawing a sarcastic picture of today’s capitalistic society. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fool%27s+Paradise">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
