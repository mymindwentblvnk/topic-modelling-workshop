emocore/melodic hardcore from Italy.

Eversor started out as a thrash metal band in 1985, by the early 90s they moved towards a melodic hardcore not far from the likes of Lifetime, Slap Of Reality or Two Line Filler. They split up in 2000, brothers Marco and Lele Morosini (only constant members) continued to play together in The Miles Apart.
