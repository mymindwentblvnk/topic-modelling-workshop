Hovercraft was an experimental space rock/noise rock group, formed in 1993 in Seattle, Washington. It was co-founded by its core duo of guitarist/samplist/tape looper Ryan Shinn (aka Ryan Campbell, Campbell 2000), and bassist Beth Liebling (aka Sadie 7, ex-wife of Eddie Vedder) out of the ashes of the band Space Helmet, which also included members of Magnog.  Hovercraft has been cited as one of the most abrasive, non-commercial sounding bands ever to receive major-label distribution for its albums.

Hovercraft's sound came to be characterized by Shinn's effects-laden guitar soundscapes, which made heavy use of delay and reverb on his main guitar, a Fender Stratocaster. The use of effects enabled him to often simulate the simultaneous playing of multiple guitarists, though he was always the lone guitarist, both in the studio and onstage. Leibling generally played single-note, ominous, pulsating basslines, played "clean" (with no effects). Early drum beats were generally sparse, yet jazzy; they became more complex as the band gradually added more highly-skilled drummers over the years.  They gave their last concert 16th February 2001 in Seattle.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hovercraft">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
