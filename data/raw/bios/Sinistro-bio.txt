Coming from an unlikely location like Lisbon, Portugal, SINISTRO are the embodiment of both lush and devastating musical landscapes driven by five individuals from distinct art circles.

SINISTRO have been cultivating sonic exploration since writing their self-titled debut album, which was released in 2012 and delivers elegant doom rock combined with a soundtrack like approach that harvested praise from both public and critics alike.

SINISTRO's next effort 'Cidade' (2013) welcomed singer Patr√≠cia Andrade on board and went on to explore a massive wall of guitars combined with gritty keyboard layers and an emotional vocal performance. With the added singing, some writers suggested Fado as one of the band's aesthetic resources. Backed by unanimous critical acclaim, 'Cidade' established SINISTRO as an essential name in the Portuguese music scene.

SINISTRO began composing their next album in 2014. The band added a second guitarist into their fold, who helped pushing their unique style another step further. Keeping a cinematic feeling in the background, The Portuguese vary from abrasive musical thickness to a perfect sense of stillness, which portrays the urban landscapes of their homeland and its legacy with a strong visual presence. SINISTRO created seven brand new tracks that are bound to appeal to music fans of various genres.

Despite being a comparatively new entity, the members of SINISTRO are no strangers to their native music scene. The band features an actress, a music producer, and instrumentalists, who have followed this path for over 20 years as part of other acts such as WE ARE THE DAMNED, BESTA, MOURNING LENORE, and many others.
