Grim Drowsiness aims to create an aggressive but melodic sound inspired from classical artists like Wagner and Bach as well. The elaborate patterns and phrasings found in each song give space to dreamlike lyrics that complete the compositions. Often the contents deal with the uneasiness of living in modern society inspiring the listener to become aware of the true reality which pushes human beings to an endless "grim drowsiness".

After a brief period together years ago, the current Grim Drowsiness was started in 2006 when Mariano, Simona and Alberto decided to form a band to express their passion toward music, combining various metal influences. In order to complete the lineup, Fabrizio joined the band and later Guido took the place of Mattia Cossu on bass guitar.
