2) 13 Candles was also the short-lived solo project of Orlok from Countess, Hordes, Fallen Temple and several other Dutch underground bands and projects. Orlok recorded and released one demo tape (which was over 45 minutes long) with this monicker in April 1993, titled "Pilgrimage to the Gate of Sin". The music style was crude and primitive black metal with some doomy touches. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/13+Candles">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
