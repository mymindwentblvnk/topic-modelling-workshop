Melancholy power.

Pushed in front of the scene late in 2016 with his Warehouse Memories EP released on ARTS, "I Hate Models" has known an eye-popping ascent.
With a variety of releases on labels such as ARTS, Voitax, T/W/B or Pls.uk, 
he is as eclectic in his productions as in his DJ sets, and navigates between 
Rave music, Industrial sounds or EBMish productions.

He tries to not limit himself to a specific genre, exploring all electronic universes, and succeeded to create a certain "touch" recognizable in his tracks, 
with an association between emotional synths and colder sounds. 

With an artistic line based on the expression of melancholia and intense emotions, his music can be characterized by a showdown between 
Love and Hate, Darkness and Light.
