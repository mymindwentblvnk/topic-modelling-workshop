Frozen By Fire is an all original Melodic Heavy Metal band from Las Vegas Nevada. The band's music features big choruses, powerful riffs, amazing guitar work with dual solos, solid driving bass, pounding drums, vocals ranging from clean singing to full out rock wailing, and even vocal harmonies. The songs range from heavy, hard, and fast, to slow grinding rockers, to sensitive ballads, to all out in your face rock and roll. Always entertaining, and looking to take things to the next level. The band has been playing locally in Las Vegas, at clubs and venues, working on perfecting their craft. The band has just finished our first full length album, on sale now!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Frozen+By+Fire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
