In the early 1970s, Bill Holt produced a recording called "dreamies" - a collage of songs performed on guitar and synthesizer (a Moog Sonic 6) combined with snippets of found sound. The album consists of two long tracks (originally one one each side of the black plastic disk) called Program 10 and Program 11, a reference to the Beatles' Revolution #9. "Dreamies" includes excerpts of radio and television broadcasts as well as samples taken from recordings by the Beatles. It is one the earliest examples of sampling in popular music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dreamies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
