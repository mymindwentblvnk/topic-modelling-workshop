Founded by Hiroaki Yura in 2003 and based in Sydney, Australia, the Eminence Symphony Orchestra aims to change the perceptions of symphonic music and hopes to open it to a wider audience by breaking new ground in music history through contemporary programming. They hold the annual concert, A Night In Fantasia, as well as other performances such as Piano Stories. They have recently held Passion, a concert featuring notable video game and anime music in collaboration with Japanese video game composers Yasunori Mitsuda and Hitoshi Sakimoto. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eminence+Symphony+Orchestra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
