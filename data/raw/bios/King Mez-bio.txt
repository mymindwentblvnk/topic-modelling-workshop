Ambitiously battling to emerge as a respected lyricist and emcee from North Carolina, King Mez has managed to differentiate himself with a righteous delivery unsullied with superficial content too familiar these days in popular music. Instead, the young emcee brings to the table a flow far more personal, executed with a demeanor that demonstrates he deserves every ounce of respect he's ever received.

From collaborating with esteemed producers J.Cole, Ski Beatz, Omen, Soundtrakk, to his recent features in XXL, The Source, BET, MTV, Spin Magazine, Life + Times and the New York Times to name a few,  Mez is building a network of talent around him while honing his skills and staying true to his unique sound. To add to his network, he has collaborated with clothing brands Stussy, 10Deep, Rocksmith, and Raleigh Demin. In addition to perfecting his lyrical skillset and occasionally stylin', Mez's music video can be seen in heavy rotation in Footlockers and Foot Actions across the United States.

With three incredibly solid mixtape releases under his belt (The Paraplegics 2010, The King's Khrysis 2011, My Everlasting Zeal 2012), Mez is steadily marching the path paved by his NC forefathers, with no signs of stopping where the sidewalk ends. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/King+Mez">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
