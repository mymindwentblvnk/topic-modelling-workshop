Infinity Shred is an electronic and post-rock trio from New York City comprised of Damon Hardjowirogo (synthesizers, visuals), George Stroud (drums), and Nathan Ritholz (guitar, synthesizers). Up until April 2012, the band was a duo of Hardjowirogo and Stroud known as Starscream; the group's name was changed due to "unfortunate legal circumstances," while Ritholz (who previously contributed to Starscream's Future, Towards the Edge of Forever) also became a full-time member.

Infinity Shred's music continues the stylistic traditions and space-inspired themes of Starscream's work while also expanding beyond the use of solely 8-bit hardware as their electronics. Their first EP under their new name, EP 001 (Gnar Dream), was released on May 15, 2012. Their debut LP, Sanctuary, is slated for a September 2013 release on Paracadute. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Infinity+Shred">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
