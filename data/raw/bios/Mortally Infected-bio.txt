The band MORTALLY INFECTED was preceded by deathers from Bratislava – Mortal Inected.The band was founded in the spring of 1995 by Ondro /guitar/ and early band members – Miso /guitar, vocals/, Ivan /bass/ and Brano /drums/. In the spring of 1997 there were some line-up changes. Brano and Ivan left Mortal Infected. Lubo /drums/ and Miro /bass/ joined the band. In the autumn this formation recorded the demo „Tell me a poem“ and thereafter it was disbanded. Soon, Ondro was able to bring together new musicians and in 1998 he revived the band. Miso A. /guitar/, Jano /vocals/, Sigi /drums/ and during the summer also Miso N. /bass/ joined the band. Still, it was unable to settle a persisting band formation and more line-up changes took place. Several musicians joined and left the band – Peto S. /drums/, Rado /guitar/, Ajo /drums/, Fokus /guitar/, Spano /bass/. The third period of history of M.I. started in the summer of 2001. Peto H. /drums/, Miso K. /guitar/, Ivan K. /bass/ and in the autumn of the same year also Vuldzar /vocals/ gradually joined the band. In the spring of 2003 Miso K. was substituted by Tom and the title of the band was changed to MORTALLY INFECTED because the original title was gramatically incorrect. The music became more brutal and it was clearly tending to brutal deathmetal. When Peto left M.I. in the summer of 2005, the band existed also by the title of Decrial for a while and there were several attempts to play with makeshift computer-made drums. In the spring of 2006 Sead /drums/ finally joins the band and in the autumn MORTALLY INFECTED records the singel „Keep it fucking brutal !!!“ at „TSL“ in Nedozery-Brezany.
