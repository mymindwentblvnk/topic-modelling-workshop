Sufosia is a Croatian thrash metal band from Zagreb, Croatia founded by Davor Garašić and Ozren Futivić in 2006. Later that year Vedran Hochberger and Matko Staudacher joined the band, and in 2009 Tomislav Ivković took Vedran's place on the guitar. 

They have released a five-song demo EP called "Chaotic Dreams" in late 2007 and two singles "Tea" and "Pain" at the end of 2008. 

Sufosia then gained major notoriety and was taken noticed by the global metal community when they released a 2009 live cover version of the Megadeth hit "Hangar 18" via YouTube, receiving well over 12,000 views in the first month of it's release with the growing number of 154,623 views to date.

Megadeth bassist David Ellefson has been quoted as saying,
"It sounds really, really good!"

They then took advantage of the digital platform In March of 2011 with their first full-length Debut album entitled "Inspiration Breakdown", which went on to sell around 1000+ copies worldwide.

"Inspiration Breakdown" was recorded and produced in "TOP Studio" in Zagreb by Marko Josipović who joined the band later that same year.

SUFOSIA have established themselves and continue to perform dozens of shows/festivals in Croatia, including Metalcamp '09' and a few in neighbouring countries Hungary, Slovenia. The group also appeared on a few TV and radio shows and continue to attract new fans daily. 


Sufosia is currently working on their as-yet-untitled second album and is having former Megadeth drummer Nick Menza as a guest player on one of the songs from the album called Insolent Scum.
