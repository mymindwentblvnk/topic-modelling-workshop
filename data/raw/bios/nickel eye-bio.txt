Nickel Eye is the solo project of The Strokes' bassist Nikolai Fraiture. The band consists of Nikolai Fraiture (guitar, vocals, electric bass, double bass, harmonica), Joel Cadbury (steel guitar), Jamie McDonald (guitar) and Brett Shaw (drums). Their debut album, 'The Time of the Assassins', out January 27 via Rykodisc, is a "pretty stripped down" collection of guitar, bass, drums, and a touch of mellotron. And its standout track, "Providence, RI," sees Fraiture's songwriting chops surface as he recalls childhood memories to a head-bobbing melody.
