Blanch, from Slovakia composed by Bianca Macková, Dominik Špuler, Marek Votruba, and Jakub Kolesár 
Blanch formed in early 2002 when Marc Baker and Matt Barron decided to start the band while sitting in their 10th grade math class. They still needed another guitarist and a bassist though. Julian Ferrett and Dan Margonari who had just began playing their instruments were asked to join. The band started as a cover band and played its first show on July 5, 2002. The band was originally known as Out of Place and several shows were played at CD Warehouse under this name. The name Out of Place was dropped in mid 2003 and replaced by Against It All. One show was played under this name. Around this time the band also began writing their own songs. The band continued to play shows and work on their new songs through 2003. The band played shows including birthday parties also. In 2004 the bands name was changed to its final name Blanch. Julian, a fan of the Golden Girls, came up with the new name. In March of 2004, the band played March Arts and the band recorded a seven song demo in April of 2004 entitled "Overnight Sensation." On May 1, 2004, Blanch played their biggest show to date, The Battle of the Bands at the Greensburg YMCA. The band took a break over the next several months when the members of the band went away to college. In 2005, the band began writing new songs and became a five piece. In mid 2005 after 3 years together, the band decided to go their separate ways. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blanch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
