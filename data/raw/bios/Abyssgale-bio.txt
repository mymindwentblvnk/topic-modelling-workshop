Abyssgale are a black metal band from Greece.The band founder, Godium, embodied an extreme sound around the band and finally on January 2006 ABYSSGALE went in the studio for their first recording. The Abyss took the form of flesh and "The Coming Plague" E.P rose to the surface, by including 4 tracks of a stormily black metal sound, with the sense of the "old school" darkness and the personal riffing style.
