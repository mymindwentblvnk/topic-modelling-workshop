Say Hi (formerly Say Hi to Your Mom) is a Seattle, Washington-based indie rock group run by Eric Elbogen. Droning, guitar- and synth-driven ditties should finally earn him a reputation alongside Nada Surf and Clem Snide as one of his borough's more noteworthy indie-rock acts. But really, it's the quirky lyricism that most distinguishes the band.

They have recorded four albums as Say Hi to Your Mom: Discosadness (2002), Numbers & Mumbles (2004), Ferocious Mopes (2005), Impeccable Blahs (2006).

Since September 1st, 2007 the band is now officially called Say Hi. "The Wishes and the Glitch" is the first release under the new moniker. Oohs & Aahs was released in 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Say+Hi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
