Misanthropy Legion is a 2-piece DIY Black Metal outfit from central New Jersey (USA) founded in 2005 by Wraith. In the first years the band went through several minor lineup changes eventually reverting back to the original two-man lineup. Lyrical topics branch from left-hand path philosphy, internal misanthropy, societal despondency, and various elements of contemporary and ancient Western Occultism. Misanthropy Legion consists of founders Joe "Wraith" Aversario (guitar, vocals, and bass) and Itay N. Krasilshikov (percussion, backing vocals, and mixing). Releases include "Forever Entombed" (2006 demo, self released), Devoid of Humanity (2007 demo, released through Thor's Hammer Productions (FRA)), and "ALAL" (2007-8 EP, ENDLESS PATH PRODUCTIONS). Misanthropy Legion also recorded a full length "Eidolon" in late 2008, but due to lack of funding and poor response it has not yet been released or distributed. The original Misanthropy Legion demos were noted for their raw quality and violent lyrical content.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Misanthropy+Legion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
