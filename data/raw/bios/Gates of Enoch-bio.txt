Formed in late 2003 by former members of Crimson Massacre, Gates of Enoch emerged from Houston, Texas. Upon departing Crimson Massacre due to differences in opinion on musical direction, guitarist Deadaeons and vocalist Krullenzith quickly churned out a 2-track demo in early 2004. The duo's unique brand of twisted, chaotic black metal was immediately apparent, attracting the attention of bassist Lycanthrope, drummer Mythos (formerly of Last Eve) and guitarist Tephros (formerly of Ashes of Misery). First taking the stage on October 31st, 2004, this complete lineup began performing in  venues in Houston, Austin, Dallas, Baton Rouge, New Orleans and Harlingen, with such acts as Enslaved, Rotting Christ, Immolation, Finntroll, Belphegor, Arsis, The Faceless, Averse Sefira, Thornspawn, Insidious Decrepancy, Vesperian Sorrow, and Quinta Essentia, quickly selling out of their independently released debut EP, "The Banishing."

After setbacks following the ejection of drummer Mythos, the recruitment of new drummer Kaziklu, the untimely death of Krullenzith in early 2006, and the departure of Deadaeons (who hand-picked Ouroboros, his successor), Gates of Enoch reformed, refocused, and remained active until early 2010, at which point the the band split, the bulk forming The Forest of Suicides and Tephros forming Taninsam. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gates+of+Enoch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
