The idea for a solo project AUDIOVISION started in 2002 after releasing and touring with WISDOM CALL where I wrote some songs together with Lars Chriss (Lion's Share, Road To Ruin) AUDIOVISION is the biggest album project that Christian Rivel have ever done.

Lars Chriss was hired as producer for this big album project. I wanted to create an album filled with good melodic hardrock and heavy metal with uplifting lyrics. On top of that I wanted to invite great musicians I look up to and respect for their great talents and create a top notch production. The result speaks for it self!


Musically we get Hard Rock with an at times pretty strong Metal influence, which shows the variability of Christian, as NARNIA are rather neo-classically influenced and DIVINEFIRE fire off the heavy Bombast Power Metal mortar and almost all songs have one thing in common, the pretty heavy guitars, which bring in a nice heaviness, but without neglecting the catchiness (never drifting off into sappiness, though), but keeping the quality very high at all times. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Audiovision">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
