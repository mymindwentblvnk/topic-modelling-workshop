2. Formed in 2001, Severed has managed to survive and conquer the fickle nature of the NY music world through an indomitable work ethic and a musical ideology that favors quality songwriting above all else. Having developed one of the largest and most dedicated fan bases that the region has seen, Severed are poised to expand their influence to the rest of the world with the release of their new eponymous CD in May of 2010.

"As any band who lives to make their music known, we've put blood, sweat and tears into our new CD. We feel the music directly mirrors us as a group. The album is a raw representation of Severed's influences and personalities, and as such we've decided on self titling it. There's no hiding behind fluff or concept. Take it or leave it, what you hear is who we are."
