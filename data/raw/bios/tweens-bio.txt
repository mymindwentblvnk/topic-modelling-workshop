Self-described as a "trash pop band," Cincinnati's TWEENS borrow from their hometown's rock history as well as from bad-girl punk from the '70s through the '90s. The trio formed in April 2012 when vocalist/guitarist Bridget Battle began playing a Dixie-Cups song with drummer Jerri Queen and bassist Peyton Copes in the practice space of the house they shared. It was very different musical territory than the trio's other projects: Battle was a member of the electronic noise band Public Housing, while Queen and Copes played in the experimental punk act Vacation. Soon after forming, TWEENS began playing local shows and released a cassette of cover songs, Live @ Mohawk. The band got a big break in 2013 when it was recommended as an opening act for one of the Breeders' Last Splash reunion gigs by the owner of a local record store. After playing that show, TWEENS were brought on for much of the Breeders' East Coast dates and for their entire West Coast tour. Between these shows and dates with the Black Lips, the band still managed to record its self-titled debut album with Eli Janney at Brooklyn's Saltlands Studio, and TWEENS was released in April 2014.
