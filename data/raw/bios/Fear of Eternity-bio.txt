Fear of Eternity is a one man atmospheric black metal band from Fiumefreddo di Sicilia (Catania), Sicily, Italy. Andrea Tilenni founded this project in 2000 and to date he has been the only member and plays all instruments. 

The first self-produced cd, “Toward the Castle”, was created after a hard work during various years.
His music is a solitary project created after his experience with Sinoath (he was the drummer in the album “Research”), and he follows the same draw of other people (e.g. Burzum, Mortiis and so on). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fear+of+Eternity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
