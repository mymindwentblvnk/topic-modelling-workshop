WZT Hearts (say "Wet Hearts") was a Baltimore drone outfit from 2005 to 2008. They released two albums: 2006's "Heat Chief" and "Threads Rope Spell Making Your Bones" in 2007. The band displayed a wide open selection of influences, alternately conjuring images of noise gristle, free-jazz wallop, psychedelic expansiveness, and the intellectual curiosity of modern composition. They specialized in filling beer-soaked floors with their dope transcendent drones. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wzt+Hearts">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
