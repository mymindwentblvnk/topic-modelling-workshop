Since 2007, Ivalys has developed its style, exploring several facets of its musical roots.
Combining dark heavy rythms and brighter melodies, the music of the band is asserting by harmonizing opposites and has first found a place in the symphonic metal fold.
Direct as contrasted, the first Ivalys compositions deliver a positive and strong energy.

Ivalys has supported several French metal bands such as : Blazing War Machine, Markize, Whyzdom, Benighted Soul and even played for the first show of Dagoba's tour at Fall 2010.
At the begining of the year 2011 the band releases its first 4 tracks- EP called ' Words In Time ' which mainly represents the musical origins of the project and finally signs to the italian label WormHoleDeath / Aural Music group at the end of 2011 for the release of its debut album entitled ' Lumen ' expected in 2012.
