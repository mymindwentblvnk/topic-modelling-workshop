Vanbot are the songs that loves the synthesizer, lives for the nerv and longs to dance. Plenty of ideas recorded on the cell while biking fast through Stockholm, some finalized in the tiny room with the oversized worldmap where dreams can fly. Vanbot is the unavoidable expression of music simply needs to come out.

The music is written by Ester Ideskog and produced together with Sebastian Forslund. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vanbot">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
