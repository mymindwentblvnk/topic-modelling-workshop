A Band so undergound that no description can be given that can ever cover where this band stands for!

After the bandmembers found out that the Twittername for Lythronax was already taken the name of the band was changed immediately to the original bandname Brainpulp (which was founded over 25 years ago).
Brainpulp continues to be just as underground as Lythronax was! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lythronax">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
