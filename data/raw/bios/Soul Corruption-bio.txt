Soul Corruption are a melodic thrash/death metal band from the south of England. Initially getting together around the spring of 2007 the band was forced however to take a hiatus fairly on their formation with Marc their original lead guitarist being stricken with Cancer.

Spring 2008: The band got up and running, writing sessions had begun but this time as a 3 piece. The band started to record their first EP called “The Burning” in their home studio. Lead guitar duties were filled by a temporary lead guitarist – Matt, who was able to lay down some lead tracks. Though due to other commitments Matt was not able to remain a full member and left just before the EP was finished.

Soul Corruption now having a 4 track EP, began the search begun for a permanent lead guitarist so gigging could begin. This slot was quickly filled in August 2008 when Mark Hutchins came onboard.

With influences ranging from Pantera, Machine Head, Metallica, Megadeth, Hypocrisy, Children Of Bodom, Lamb Of God as well as old school 80’s Metal, Soul Corruption have a deadly arsenal of hard hitting thrash rhythms, pounding double bass and molten lead guitar work giving them a killer sound!

“The Burning” EP is still available on iTunes, Napster and other good online music download sites.

2011: The band have completed work on their latest EP called "Burn Beg Bleed" and are currently looking for a stand alone vocalist to add a new dimension to their sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Corruption">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
