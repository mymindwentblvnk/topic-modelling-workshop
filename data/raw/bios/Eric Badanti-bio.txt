Eric Badanti is a musician in the neo-classical piano genre and one of many somewhat mysterious musicians to be included on Spotify's immensely popular 'Peaceful Piano' playlist. While some 'peaceful piano' artists made a name for themselves, release albums and perform live, others seem anonymous and faceless, as internet searches do not yield any biographical information or images of the person behind the music. Do you know who this person is? Do you have a picture of them? Please share. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Badanti">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
