Dutch singer and (song)writer, Aafke Romeijn (born Overasselt, The Netherlands, 1986), was a singer in Mister Blue Sky for six years before she decided she had enough songs to carry on by herself and under her own name. 

She self-released her English-language d√©but album Stella Must Die! in 2011, then reverted to writing and singing in Dutch, to increasing critical and public acclaim, on the Chin. Ind. Spec. Rest. (2014) and Je Doet Je Best Maar (2016) albums - as well as the Anders Nog Iets? EP (2016). The change of language also marked a significant shift in musical style: from piano-based songs to pop songs with - in many cases - electronic beats and other hiphop references.

Before starting a career in music, Aafke Romeijn was a teacher (Dutch language) at a Dutch high school. She also works as a journalist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aafke+Romeijn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
