Ayla Nereo is a singer-songwriter based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Quiet and luminous folk-based songs range from intimate snapshots of love and life to psychedelic myth-making; from the intensely human to the sublime. She is one half of the sibling duo, Beatbeat Whisper.
Ayla self-released her debut album Play Me a Time in 2005. Sophomore release, Floating Felt, was released in February, 2009, and BeHeld was released in 2012.
In 2013, she collaborated with The Polish Ambassador to sculpt a new phenomenon as Wildlight.
