Black Countess is a symphonic black metal band with gothic metal influences from Ulyanovsk, Russia, formed in 1992. They generally portray a strongly controversial style of music related to gothic eroticism and sexual vampiric imagery.

Ilya Polagushin is genuinely the man behind the dirty business. He has different sexual fetishes, which became a distinguishable transition between all the albums and EPs, a common fetish is his captivation for legs. He does all of the instruments including guitars, vocals, bass and keyboards. Other than that, he hired two drummers and some session bass/guitarists to back up some of his stuff.
The other members are two female vocalists and a few others, whom engage in Ilya's sexual fantasies by adding an erotic effect to the music along with various sexual noises. Natalia does some of those noises on the early EPs and during the second album "Carnivorous Romance" Katerina Polevina takes over.

Black Countess is currently signed on Metalism Records. They are still currently active but, Ilya is looking for more members to help fill in for some of the albums. An album has been awaiting since 2007. It appears, there has been some gaps between Black Countess' releases due to the session members, whom are constantly joining off and on.
