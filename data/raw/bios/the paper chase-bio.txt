The Paper Chase was an experimental rock band from Dallas, Texas (formed in 1998), disbanded in 2010.

Since their inception, The Paper Chase (sometimes spelled "the pAper chAse") has produced a combination of discordant melody and jagged noise pop.

The band consists of ringleader vocalist and guitarist John Congleton and piano and synthesizer guru Sean Kirkpatrick, with a heavy rhythm section of Bobby Weaver on bass and Jason Garner on the drum kit. 

Congleton has written and produced all the material the band has produced as of yet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+pAper+chAse">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
