There are several artists named Gothmog.

Gothmog (1) is a black metal band from Spain that began its existence in summer 2005 under their former name Torn Asunder. After some changes in the line-up and some months of rehearsals, they played their first gig one in January 2006 with great acceptance from the audience.

2006 became a good year for the band as they played with big names from the metal scene and got very good critics. During the year of 2007 the line-up went through several changes that prevented them from playing live, but also let them find the most appropriate line-up which is the following: PIKAATH (founding member): vocals; BAAL-THAMOR (founding member): drums; ECHAK: guitars; DRAUG: guitars. 

In April 2008 they entered Fernando Asensi's studio in Valencia to record their debut album "A Step in the Dark" which was released in December 2008. In October 2008, the line-up was finally completed with the arrival of DARHEN: bass.

The style of Gothmog combines fast melodic black metal in the vein of Emperor, Dimmu Borgir or Immortal which are, probably, their major influences, focusing themselves in topics going from the epic to the obscure, always giving a personal vision to each of their lyrics.
