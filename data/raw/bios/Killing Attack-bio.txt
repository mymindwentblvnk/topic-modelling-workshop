Killing Attack was formed in Joensuu, Finland, in 2015.

Originally the band was a trio that played Mot√∂rhead -influential hard rock/metal and held different names, but was renamed to Killing Attack and changed to thrash metal in early 2015. The original bassist was replaced in late 2015 and the first demo/EP "Annihilation" was recorder with only two members.

From 2016 the band has had four members that have stayed the same since. Killing Attack has also recorded "Waiting to Die" (demo 2017), "Plague" (single 2018) and Non-Biogenic Human Race" (single 2018).
