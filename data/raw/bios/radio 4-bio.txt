Radio 4 were a politically aware dance punk band, from New York, USA (formed 1999) & named after a Public Image Ltd. song. Though their music is often compared to releases from the likes of Gang Of Four, flirtation with electronics results in a more 21st century sound.  The group had disbanded in 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Radio+4">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
