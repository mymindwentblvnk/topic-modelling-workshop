Vintage Warlords are a morbid piece of rotting nostalgia full of sludgy doom-laden riffs straight from the scattered remains of death metals humble origins. Monstrous guitars, tortured vocals, and an abandoned sense of security will overwhelm any and all in the underground who dare face the new heirs to the doom / death throne! Feat. ex-bassist of Abigail Williams, Thomas Haywood, (aka Plaguehammer)
