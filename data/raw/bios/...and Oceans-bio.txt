...and Oceans (ex-Festerday) is a black metal band formed in Finland in 1995. As their career has progressed, they have pursued a less traditional, more Industrial, electronica-oriented direction. Since 2005, they are no longer going by the name "...and Oceans", changing their moniker to "Havoc Unit", as they feel the musical ideals of ...and Oceans were complete and it was time for them to change. Since 2013 they are again known as Festerday.

In 2020 they released "Cosmic World Mother" under the moniker ...And Oceans. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/...and+Oceans">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
