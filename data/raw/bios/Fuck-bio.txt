Fuck is an American Indie rock band, formed in San Francisco in 1993. They have recorded for a number of labels including Matador Records and Homesleep Records of Italy, and feature members Timothy Prudhomme, Geoff Soule, Kyle Statham, and Theodore Ellison.

Fuck began in Oakland, California in 1993, allegedly meeting in a police holding cell. They released their first single "MonkeyBeautyShotgun" shortly after.

After putting out a self-released cassette on their vanity Rhesus label, 1996 brought their debut album Pretty...Slow, ultimately released on three different labels, and Baby Loves a Funny Bunny.

The band was later signed to Matador Records, who released their album Pardon My French in 1997 and Conduct in 1998.

The band would leave Matador for Homesleep Records, and would have the album Gold Bricks released in 2001. Following that album was the critically acclaimed Cupid's Cactus.

In 2003, the band released Those Are Not My Bongos on Future Farmer Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fuck">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
