ATMOSPHERIX - [Vampire // Good Looking // Nu:Directions // Fokuz // Have A Break // Urban Chemistry // Future Thinkin // Vibez // Rubik // Basswerk // Influenza:LTD]

Hi, I'm Atmospherix aka Meersman Olivier hailing from Temse (Belgium), born in 1990.
In September 2006 I decided to buy a pair of decks & started to mix music.
I was introduced to producing beats in the end of 2005.

2 years later, in the Summer of 2008 my first track was signed on the German Label "BASSWERK RECORDS" for an mp3 release and short after this I had more tracks signed to labels such as "GOOD LOOKING RECORDS", "FOKUZ RECORDS", "VAMPIRE RECORDS", "INFLUENZA LTD" and more ...

I also got DJ support from artists like: GOLDIE , LTJ BUKEM , LOXY , NOOKIE , MAKOTO , ANDY MYSTIC , BIG BUD , SKS , PHYSICS , NOTION , CRISSY CRISS , STUNNA , SUBJECT 13 and more ... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Atmospherix">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
