Dark Army is Jon Williams' brainchild; writing all lyrics and music, playing all bass and guitar parts, doing the vocals and programming the drums, Williams creates industrial black metal. Former member John Hibbard played the keyboard.

Dark Army donated its rendition of 'From The Cradle To Enslave' to the 2003 Cradle of Filth tribute album 'Covered In Filth'. So far, Dark Army has released two albums: Dark Army (2001) and Death Throes Daemonicus (2002). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Army">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
