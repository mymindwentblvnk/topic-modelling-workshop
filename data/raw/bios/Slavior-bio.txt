Greg Analla (vocals), Wayne Findlay (guitar / keyboards), Mark Zonder (drums)



During 2005 it was revealed that Warlord, Under-Radio and Fates Warning drummer Mark Zonder had fired up a new band endeavour, billed Templewithin, in collaboration with Michael Schenker Group guitarist/keyboard player Wayne Findlay and the Valhalla, Masi and Hawk credited vocalist David Fefolt. Also involved in these sessions would be the Tribe of Gypsies' credited singer Greg Analla. Signing to Greece's Black Lotus Records Templewithin cut the debut album 'Slavior'.

In June 2006 Black Lotus Records collapsed. Shortly afterward Zonda announced the band had re-titled itself Slavior, stating the new name "better represents the style and image of the band". Slavior signed to Inside Out Music in October.
