Based around the idea of blending dark minor chord riffing, guitar harmonies, and soaring vocals that lament the bleakness of modern urban life, Assembly At Dusk has created a sound that is uniquely heavy metal. Formed by veterans of bands such as The Pathos of Clytaemnestra, Iron Hand, The Total End, and They And The Children, the band spent the past two years crafting their metal instead of rushing to get to the stage. It was more important for them to first create music that speaks for itself. Now, with two demos under their belt and a permanent drummer, Assembly At Dusk is ready to take to the stage to perform the soundtrack of the world's descent to rack and ruin.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Assembly+at+Dusk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
