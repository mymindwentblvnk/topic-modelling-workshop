Born back in 1997, four high school kids united to ignite their flame of inevitable talent to emerge through the barriers of the Indian music industry as Dementra – a metal outfit that spelt out attitude the day it was born and redefined the way rock evolved in India. Dementra – was founded by frontman Brian D’Souza who was joined by keyboardist Kevin D’Souza, drummer Ashwin Thakkar & guitarist Darshan Thakkar. Four teenagers who combined their creative talents & efforts to bring forth – 2 chart topping albums – “Doorway to Demention” & “Lost at Creation” – Dementra went on to become the first & youngest ever Indian metal artists to top the MP3.Com world charts in 2001. In 2002 the band went on to win an EMA Award – becoming the first & only Indian band to ever do so. Dementra realized the power of the web and the extent to which music could go far & beyond & decided to step forth into the international arena with their own sound, their own way. The step they took proved without a doubt that the underground in India could surface to a level unimaginable. As a band they always took up music as a passion never a profession. In 2005 the band decided to go their own ways to pursue individual careers outside the world of music. 10 years of being part of an unchanged line-up, extreme experience & an awesome journey into the world of Metal - The pioneers who put Indian metal on the World Map - beating all the odds and doing things their own way, Dementra continue to invade the extended minds of true hard-core metal lovers. Dementra, truly a band that chose to differ from the rest & did things on their on terms but still paved the way for each and every Indian band out there to make use of the power of the web to get the music across to the millions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DEMENTRA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
