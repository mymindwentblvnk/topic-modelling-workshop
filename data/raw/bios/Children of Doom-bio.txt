The children of doom were born in August 2008 from the alcoholism and sonorous union of 3 brothers, brought up in love of Doom Metal and basically of music. They play Doom n'Raw, the meeting between the heaviest and strongest style of Heavy Metal and the spontaneity of rawer kinds like Punk and Blues. These children of doom evolve in a grimy and rusty garage where sound Hard of 70's at it's first hour until the very end of punk's blazing peaks. This savage union of kinds has all it's sense on stage, through the energy, the loudness and the aggressiveness of killing and headbanging riffs played by these 3 brothers.
   1st demo, Ride Over the Green Valley, was released in October 2009. A 7" with The Bottle Doom Lazy Band called Doom Freaks was released on January 21st, 2011, followed by their debut album, Doom, Be Doomed, Ã–r Fuck Off, released on June 8th, 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Children+of+Doom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
