Vladimir Kudenkov is the real name behind the moniker of Nosense. Nowadays also active as producer, he started around 2003 as a DJ in the nightclubs of Moscow. Initially focusing on a mix of techno, progressive and tech house, he eventually founded the electronic metal band All For Fake in 2008. He recorded the first studio album Forget Yourself and Shadows Of The Worlds EP with the band as the lead guitarist and producer. In late 2011, influenced by the modern bass scene his focus changed to this new energetic form of electronic dance music. Soon Nosense played at more and more dubstep and drum 'n' bass parties and became a club promoter to develop his local bass scene. His style is a combination of electro house, dubstep, trap, glitch hop, and drum & bass with a clear focus on energy and melody; always paying attention to the dance floor. He has released tracks under Black Hole Recordings/Rub-A-Duck, Dirt, Lies & Audio Black, Modulate Records, Duty-Bound Trax, Temple Music Group, Straight Up! and more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Nosense">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
