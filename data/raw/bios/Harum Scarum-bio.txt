Harum-Scarum was an female-fronted punk band hailing from Portland, Oregon.  The band released three LPs, a 7", a split EP with Stupor, a demo cassette, and a live LP.

The band played a style of music that has been referred to as anarcho or crust punk.  Harum-Scarum frequently used political and social topics, some of them controversial,  for song material.  For example, the band sampled a clip from convicted murderess Aileen Wuornos as an introduction to their song Systematic Death as featured on their LP entitled Mental Health.

Harum-Scarum, when hyphenated, means "reckless" or "irresponsible."
