HaWthorn is a neofolk cooperation of Tony Wakeford (Sol Invictus) and Matt Howden (Sieben). Together they have developed an experimental take on modern folk, with their vocals and Matt's violin leading the way in almost every song.

They have released one album so far, The Murky Brine (2004), and have appeared on the writ in Water split with Sol Invictus and Sieben with two tracks.

They have also released two albums under the name of Howden/Wakeford. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hawthorn">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
