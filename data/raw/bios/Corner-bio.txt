There are two bands with this name:
1. CORNER, The solo project of Japanese artist Isobe Masafumi
2. Corner, A metal band from Finland

1. CORNER

CORNER started originally in the spring of 2003 as a side project during Isobe Masafumi's days as the vocalist/guitarist for the pop-punk band HUSKING BEE. Releasing his first album "Hashiru Namakemono" the same year the project began, it really wasn't until HUSKING BEE disbanded in 2005 that Isobe was able to focus more energy into CORNER, releasing the split single "small happiness" with FINE LINES. In May of 2006, Isobe ultimately created a new band under the name of MARS EURYTHMICS. However, even with this new project, he has continued to work on creating music with CORNER, releasing a new single the same month called "single-01". This single was eventually followed up with the release of the album "Iriguchi Deguchi" in July of 2006.
