The beginning of Kandar dates back to May of 2015. Drummer Denis (Mincing Fury, Space
Hamster) and guitarist Kubyk (Somnus Aeternus, Space Hamster) were rehearsing together with
Space Hamster and they realized, that they have similar musical visions and view on extreme
music, and started composing first songs. Then they presented their music to Topi (Spineless
Fuckers, Slup, ex-Pigsty, ex-Mincing Fury), and he and he said yes. The band starts to work on
concept and compose more songs. Short promo with four songs is recorded during the summer
2015, which can be heard on Bandzone or Bandcamp. Next step is to have enough material for a
full length album. While works the guys meet strange guy from Slovakia – Martin. After huge blast
they had together, the band decides to try his bass guitar skills and BAM – Kandar is four head
HYDRA! Then there were a lots of rehearsals and first concerts in full line-up. In March 2016,
Kandar closes themselves into the almighty DAVOS studio in Vyškov and with Otyn they recorded
their first album Groovy, which presents Kandar’s sick’n’horror grindcore. Groovy is going
to be released in July 2016 on Bizarre Leprous Productions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kandar">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
