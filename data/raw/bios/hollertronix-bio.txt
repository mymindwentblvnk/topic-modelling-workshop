The quirky, mash-up party crew Hollertronix came together when Diplo (or Diplodocus) moved to Philadelphia and hooked up with like-minded turntablist, Low Budget. Mixing electro with dancehall, new wave with funk, and Missy Elliot with The Clash, Hollertronix created a big buzz amongst the underground with their unique brand of party music.

In 2003 they released their first mixtape through the cutting-edge turntablist website Turntable Lab. Titled Never Scared, the mixtape found the Eurythmics, David Banner, 2 Live Crew, and Beethoven all in the mix. Named one of the New York Times' top albums of 2003, the mixtape sold out quickly but was widely traded on the internet by a growing number of fans. DJ sets around the world followed the album's success and both Diplo and Low Budget spent time on their solo careers.  2003 also saw the duo release a mix in the Cornerstone Player series.  #54 in the series saw Hollertronix mixing up everyone from RJD2, Kate Bush and Blondie with Dead Prez, Modest Mouse, 8Ball & MJG and Vybz Kartel.  The CD was only available if you were a member of Cornerstone Player's mailing list, but can be found on eBay every now and then.  Although Diplo did not appear on the album, the 2005 mix teaming Low Budget and Aaron LaCrate was released as Hollertronix and Milkcrate Records Present: Bmore Gutter Music.  That same year, Hollertronix released Volume 2 in Triple Five Soul's "T5 Soul Sessions" series.  The CD was a slight departure from previous releases in that it was a DJ mix of 80's songs (i.e Bauhaus, Siouxsie & The Banshees, New Order, Talking Heads, ESG, The Cure, Tom Tom Club, Sexual Harassment, Konk, etc...) mixed with each other, as opposed to being "mashed up" with current hits.
