There are/were at least four artists named Hideous:

First, there was a Dutch first wave punk band called Hideous. It included Terry on bass. She later, in 1980, became a founding member of Cheap'n'Nasty.

The second hails from South Carolina and creates a blend of black metal and grindcore utilizing a minimalist approach. He performs live using programmed drums and has been known to open for his other band Dark Before Dawn. He is officially on the Sounds Abound Records roster, but chooses to distribute his albums himself.

Also:
Formed from frustration, misanthropy and copious amounts of alcohol, Hideous is a concept before it’s a band. A concept that is fairly simple, take away anything unnecessary from the music. Make it as ugly as the emotions that inspired it. How can one scream about injustice with a five thousand dollar studio budget? How can you accurately present the downfalls of our superficial society while using pro-tools to fix your mistakes and polish your so-called art? Hideous embraces the D.I.Y. ethos of old and shuns the current practices that have drained the life and ferocity out of heavy metal. While most metal fans these days are quick to scream “poser” to any and everyone, Hideous is actually doing something to keep the music true to it’s roots.

The second is a Swedish fellow, who sits around during music class and makes retro-style songs, because they take him back to another time when giants like Age of Empires and Fallout ruled the earth.

The third one was born  in Stoke on Trent and raised in New Jersey, USA only to return to the U.K every now and then. He is currently in England promoting his new album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hideous">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
