Track Star was an American band comprising Matthew Troy and Wyatt Cusick, and later Brian Girgus, that formed in San Francisco in the early 90s. Initially a guitar duo using a drum machine as its rhythm section, the band continued to rehearse and perform before adding a drummer. After releasing a 7" split on Kick Down Records, Track Star recorded a split cassette with Raisler soon afterwards. 

In 1995, the band recorded and released "Sometime What's The Difference", an EP that received attention in Bay Area music circles. In 1997, Track Star tour throughout the United States in support of its debut album, "Communication Break"s. The group toured with Promise Ring, Modest Mouse and Stereolab among others. Track Star also performed at the annual Noise Pop Festival. During this time, Cusick was also involved in another band, The Aislers Set. In 2000, guitarists Cusick and Troy returned to using a drum machine for songs after splitting with its original drummer. He was replaced by Brian Girgus, former drummer of lowercase. Scrapping the material it had, Track Star recorded new material and released the 2002 album, "Lions Destroyed The Whole World".  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Track+Star">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
