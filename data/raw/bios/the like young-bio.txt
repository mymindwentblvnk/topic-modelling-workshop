The Like Young were an indie rock band from Chicago, Illinois.

The Like Young were Amanda Ziemba and Joe Ziemba, married in 2002 and playing music together in various bands since 1997 (most notably Wolfie and Busytoby). The couple formed the band in the spring of 2002 and went on to release their first album, a five-track EP entitled Looked Up Plus Four that same year on Kittridge Records. In the spring of 2003, they released their first full-length album, Art Contest, to mixed but overall not great reviews. Not to be discouraged, Amanda and Joe put their heads together and created So Serious, which was released in the summer of 2004 to very good reviews. Both of their full length albums were released on Parasol Records.

The Like Young were often compared to Weezer for their vocal harmony and guitar-driven indie rock, and while the sound is similar, it is produced by just two people, half the size if not smaller than many bands with similar sounds.

In The Like Young, Amanda played the drums and Joe played the guitar, bass, and occasionally keyboard and both do vocals. Most of the songs were written by Joe.

In August 2006, The Like Young announced their retirement.  In the announcement Joe reassured fans that the decision was a happy one.  The Like Young played their final show on September 12 at The Silverlake Lounge in Los Angeles.
