Denyall from Finland plays a mixture of melodic, athmospheric and heavy material with female vocals. The band was originally influenced mostly by Finnish bands like Pain Confessor and Diablo. Current material is yet more versatile with elements hinting about progressive and even thrash metal. Heavy riffs, catchy melodies and Terhi's beautiful voice really make the core of Denyall's unique sound.

The line up consists of
Terhi Palomäki - Vocals
Tatu Pajula - Lead guitars
Karri Kallio - Guitars
Janne Raiski - Bass
Rami Rissa - Drums

History:
Denyall was founded in September 2006 by the band's guitarists. In the beginning bass player Ari Ekola delivered growling vocals, which can be heard on our first release (Random Victims, 2007). After Ari's withdrawal we decided to keep on going with solely Terhi's clean vocals and combine them with even heavier material to develop our sound.
Janne Raiski joined Denyall as the new bassist early in the year 2007 and brought his own original vision to complete the arrangements.
All material is composed by founding members and guitar players Kallio and Pajula. Kallio also provides the bands lyrics together with vocalist Palomäki.

Denyall has published two demos:
Random Victims (2007)
Dehumanized (2008)

...the upcoming demo Your Pitfall will be released in spring 2010
The demo offers four tracks of heavy and catchy material complemented with Terhi's diverse vocal performances. There is also one new track "Of Death, Deceit and Mystery" available in Youtube with a video shot during the recording sessions.
