Chinese Folk Metal one-man band from Xi'an, China
Empyvler is a one-man-band project from a.j.alex, who is quite a independant person : he doesn't give interviews, nor play live and his whereabouts are still unknown. We just know he wrote and recorded alone  Wood Woud Would in 2006 which include elements of Folk Metal (using European traditional songs), Doom Metal (for the atmosphere) and Black Metal (for the raw riffs and the vocals). This Debut album is still the only one, since nobody knows what happened to AJ ALEX since then.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Empylver">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
