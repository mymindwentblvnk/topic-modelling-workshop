Chris Forsyth is an American guitarist known for hypnotic compositions and solo performances on 6- and 12-string guitars that assimilate minimalism and psychedelia with art rock, folk, and blues influences. He has performed widely in Europe and the US, having toured with such like-minded artists as Träd Gräs och Stenar, Steve Gunn, Ignatz, and Es. He is a founding member (with Jaime Fennelly and Fritz Welch) of gothic junk folk expressionists Peeesseye, and a member of the elusive experimental group Phantom Limb & Bison.  Other notable collaborators have included guitarist Tetuzi Akiyama, trumpeter Nate Wooley, Koen Holtkamp, singer and songwriter Meg Baird, and choreographers Miguel Gutierrez and RoseAnne Spradlin.
He is the caretaker of Evolving Ear and lives in the City of Philadelpha, USA. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Forsyth">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
