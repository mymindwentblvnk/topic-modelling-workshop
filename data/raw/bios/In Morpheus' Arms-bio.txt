In Morpheusâ€™ Arms is the name of the German progressive Metal band that has its influences in bands like Opeth, Tool, Dream Theater and The Gathering, but nevertheless practices a very personal and individual Songwriting whose texts deal with the psyche of human with its plenty of abysses and subconscious spheres. These topics are realised by vocalist Mira Kohli, guitarist Sascha Gutkowski, keyboarder Karsten Mroszczok, bass player Natalie Droege and drummer Peter Rosinski. But the Fun at making music is a not be misconceived factor that pushes the artists. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+Morpheus%27+Arms">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
