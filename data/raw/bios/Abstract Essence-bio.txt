Abstract Essence is group from the Czech Republic.
The group was established in 2004 by six young guys who wanted to play a different type of music than what was already around, as they believed music should be heavy and technical, yet full of innovations and unexpected moments.

Shortly after the foundation of this band, the first demo was released. Called "Lost Life", this record received a positive response from the metal scene. After releasing this first record, Abstract Essence began to perform live concerts regularly, performing the songs from the aforementioned demo. 

2 and half years later, the band entered the recording studio again, this time to record their first official full-length CD called "Aftermath". The record was released by the label "Lava Production" in Brno. Presently, the group is set to play a series of concerts in the hopes of presenting their music to everyone interested in heavy, melodic music full of energy and innovations. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abstract+Essence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
