There are six artists using this name:  

1) Sentinel is an Indie-​dream-​pop three piece based the Bay Area of Northern California, established since 2001. The seeds of this sunny-​seasid​e-drea​m-pop began with chance encounter between Tarabud (vocals/bass​), Dennis Bestafka (guitars), and Bill Mowery (drums) in San Francisco.

Sentinel's sound is strongly influenced by their mutual visions of 80's synth and 90's dream-pop. Bands like Cocteau Twins, Smiths, U2, My Bloody Valentine, Cure, Flock Of Seagulls, Dead Can Dance. and Ocean Blue have provided consistent inspir​ations, creating a long catalog of moods & textures to draw from while developing their sound.

Sentinel has had extensive support from local DJ's playing them over the airwaves to Bay Area listeners. They have been heard on Live105.3 FM, KALX 90.7 FM, & KZSU 90.1 FM. Also, they have been featured by Nic Harcourt's syndicated program 'Connections Made by Guitar Center' broadcast nationally on FM stations in the USA. gc.guitarcenter.com/connections. In 2015 with the release of their new album Points of Light, they have been played in over 170 + college radio stations on medium rotation. They are touring the West Coast of the United States promoting their new album.
