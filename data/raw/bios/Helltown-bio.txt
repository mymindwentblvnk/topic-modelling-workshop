1) Bedroom project from California. Lo-fi, depressive pop. http://helltown.bandcamp.com

2) Since our first line-up in middle of 2003, the band has the proposal to play a Traditional Heavy Metal with aggressive female vocals, influenced by the main eighties heavy and hard rock bands. Also with that, comes the proposal of visual appeal based on the great bands of the genre and stage performances to rescue the eighties Metal spirit. The idea is to form a band with a different style from the actual scene, saturated with melodic, gothic and new metal bands. 

3) An experimenal noise/power electronics project most frequently featured on the New Flesh label's casette compilations.
