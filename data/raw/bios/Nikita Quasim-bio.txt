Nikita Quasim started making music 
on the day of her mothers 40th birthday. 
She was only 11 years old. Not knowing what to give her, 
she recorded the sound of her laundry machine and with imovie,
unable to find any other program that could layer sounds, 
she created a dense 10 minute weaving of household chaos. 
Of Russian and Afghan descent came this Cagian prodigy 
who is now only 19 years old and yet to be 
discovered by the larger public. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nikita+Quasim">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
