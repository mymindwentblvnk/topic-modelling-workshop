1. PPP is a fictional group from anime Kemono Friends.

2. The Platinum Pied Pipers, or the more streamlined PPP, is a Detroit-based hip hop and R&B group composed of producer Waajeed (Robert O'Bryant), and multi-instrumentalist Saadiq (Darnell Bolden, not to be confused with Raphael Saadiq). Their music usually features a rotating and varied array of artists. Their soul-based debut album 'Triple P' (2005) smashed down several musical boundaries and providing a new twist on modern hip hop and soul.


The two met through rapper Baatin in 1992. Sometime in 2000, they decided to form a duo and began releasing 12"s and mixtapes. It was their collaboration with Dwele in 2003, however, called "Ridin' High" which caught the ears of music listeners, and set the stage for a full-length album. The pair have a rather distinctive mixture of sounds as, although Waajeed is primarily a hip hop producer, Saadiq is a protege of Motown songwriter Barrett Strong, making for a finely tuned middleground. As stated in interviews, the name "Platinum Pied Pipers" was chosen at random and has no connection to the Pied Piper folk tale. Since Detroit is their hometown, they have said that the city is very important to them.


Their latest work fuses their vintage and contemporary influences you're just as likely to hear a Detroit techno beat or drum 'n' bass roll amongst the fluid PPP soul as you are hip hop and funk.

They have a supporting cast who assist them in the studio and onstage; an array of talented male and female singers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/PPP">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
