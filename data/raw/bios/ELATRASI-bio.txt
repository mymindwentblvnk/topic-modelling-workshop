ELATRASI is a British-Moroccan female multidisciplinary artist, self-taught pianist and songstress based in Hertfordshire, England. Her introspective lyricism roots from the raw vulnerabilities of transforming pain into power and purpose. Inspired from her North African-Arab heritage, as well as her undeniable intrigue for uplifting, dramatic and ethereal sounds, ELATRASI’s anthems are best described as orchestral pop embraced with harmonic melodies and atmospheric cinematic soundscapes. ELATRASI returns with her sophomore single 'Immunity' after receiving support from the likes of CLOUT, Noctis Mag, EARMILK, Amazing Radio US and UK, Soho Radio London and AAAZT Radio (Arab-Fusion Artist of the Week) - winning European Ballard at the InterContinental Music Awards 2021 and Honourable Mention at Nashville's Unsigned Only Competition (Screenshot) 2021. Shortly after her sophomore release, ELATRASI has been named ‘One To Watch’ artist by BBC Music Introducing in Beds, Herts and Bucks and supported across BBC Three Counties Radio. More recently, ELATRASI became an award-winning songwriter as 2021 Third Prize Winner of the International Songwriting Competition (Performance Category) - the biggest and most competitive songwriting contest in the world.
