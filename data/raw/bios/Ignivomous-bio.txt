Ignivomous is a death metal band from Melbourne, Australia.

Formed in 2006, the band quickly issued a cassette version of the demo "Path of Attrition", which quickly sold out. This led to them signing with cult US label Nuclear War Now! and re-issuing the demo on 12" vinyl with a bonus track (a cover of ancient Australian band Necrotomy).

2008 saw the release of the "Eroded void of salvation" 7", followed up by gigs throughout Australia. Later on during the year a split 7" with fellow Australians Tzun Tzu was issued as well. In 2009, the band released their first full length album, 'Death Transmutation', through Nuclear War Now! Productions.
