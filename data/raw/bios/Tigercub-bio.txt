Revolver announced that Loosegroove Records has signed Tigercub c/w US Headlines dates in conjunction with their US & Canada shows supporting Clutch & EYEHATEGOD.

The signing of Tigercub on Loosegroove Records marks the reboot of the influential indie label that Gossard founded back in 1994 with Regan Hagar.

Significantly Gossard and Hagar signed Queens of the Stone Age and released the band’s debut album in 1998, providing a foundation to build to where they are now.

“When we discovered Tigercub, it felt like the right time to start Loosegroove back up,” says Hagar. Stone adds “It’s almost 23 years to date that Queens of the Stone Age debuted at Mercury Lounge in NYC. And now Tigercub makes their Big Apple debut in the same club on April 16th. This is just the beginning for this incredibly talented group from Brighton UK to enlighten us Yanks to the sound of the new heavy!”

Tigercub’s latest album ‘As Blue As Indigo’ was met with rave reviews from metal, rock and alt press internationally, establishing the band’s genre-pushing originality.

Written over two years, ‘As Blue As Indigo’ champions introspections drawing on the subjectivity of colour, paired with masterclass songwriting, mind-bending arrangements constructed with boundary-pushing production. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tigercub">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
