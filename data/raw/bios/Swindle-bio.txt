1) Swindle is a dubstep/grime/UK Funky producer from the UK, he has released on several labels such as Deep Medi Musik and Planet Mu, his most successful song so far has been Do The Jazz.

2) Swindle was formed in 1994 by 4 friends who wanted to create loud fast music and start something new in an almost dormant hardcore punk scene in San Diego at that time. They became very popular on the brink of a nation wide punk explosion and capitalized at home and southern california. They play punk music, but have influences from all types of underground music. They have been described by critics as "a pissed off Fifteen..." and "Balls out, Reckless Abandon, punk...." Kid Dynamite was compared to Swindle in one of their early reviews, which has probably been the most accurate representation to what Swindle sounds like to date.

These guys have played with almost every big punk band from AFI to Youth Brigade. They have toured the entire U.S. twice as well as multple trips through out California in support of their 2 albums (Within these walls...1996 and Better off dead...1998) on grilled cheese\cargo records.

Lack of committment and conflicting schedules always hurt the band, until now. With the addition of 2 new recruits (keth divel(guitar) and Dave Rierson(bass)), the 2 ORIGINAL members (Nick Lennen(drums) and Mark Smith (vocals/guitar)) have the solid line up they need. The brand new album "This is Not a Test" (Slowgun Records) showcases a more talented and mature side of the band who have finally perfected their style. On the eve of this release, Swindle are ready to assault the world with their loud sounds and train wreck live show.
