The name ‘Catuvolcus’ means ‘Combat Wolf’ in Gaul and also represents a Gaul chief of the Eburons tribe. The project was created in 2007 by Pierre-Alexandre Plessix (a.k.a. Segomaros). Catuvolcus hails from Warwick located in the very heart of Québec. In the same year, the first demo the self-produced demo O.R.F.C was released. At that time, Catuvolcus was just a simple solo project characterized as primitive black metal with lyrical themes based on the Celtic universe.

At the end of 2008, Segomaros met other musicians from the same region. Few months later, the band produced their first album entitled ‘Vae Victis’. After various gigs alongside other underground bands of Québec, the three band members left the band due to lack of interest. This happened in May 2010.

Afterwards, Segomaros decided to give an end to the scene performances so to focus more on the elaboration of a new opus. For this record, Segomaros found two sessions musicians, Keven Bélanger (a.k.a. Matrak) on bass and Maxime Côté (a.k.a Arkeron) on guitar. In August 2010 the recording of the E.P. ‘Terres de Sang’ begun! The E.P. contains six epic tracks in homage to the bravery, honour and wisdom of the Gaul civilisations. The EP was released on November 26th 2010 as a limited 50 copies "vynil style cd" and 150 standard copies. On February 3rd 2011, Matrak and Arkeron officially joined the ranks of Catuvolcus. The band is currenty working on a new album and is still looking for a label.
