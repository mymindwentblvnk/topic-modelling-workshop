Pianist John Tilbury joined the group to record The Hands of Caravaggio. Critic Brian Olewnick describes the album as "A staggering achievement, one is tempted to call The Hands of Caravaggio the first great piano concerto of the 21st century." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MIMEO">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
