Big Giant Circles is an alias for Jimmy Hinson, a composer based out of Dallas, TX. He possesses a strong affinity for video game music and is an active staff member of OverClocked ReMix (ocremix.org), a fan community of unofficial video game music remixes. Because of his involvement with OCR he was asked to arrange Guile’s theme for Capcom’s digital release of Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, HD Remix, released in 2008. More recently, he is credited as a co-composer of the music in Bioware’s Blockbuster title Mass Effect 2, released Jan 26 of 2010, along with Sam Hulick and David Kates, with Jack Wall as the project’s lead composer. The soundtrack received perfect scores from sites like IGN and Team XBox, and received heavy praise from many others. The soundtrack can be purchased as a digital download from Amazon and iTunes.
Aside from his involvement in OC ReMix and video games, Jimmy has written music for numerous TV shows, most of which are broadcast on channels owned by Scripps Networks (HGTV, DIY, Fine Living). His website is http://biggiantcircles.com
