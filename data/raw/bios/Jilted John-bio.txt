Jilted John, also known as Graham Fellows, is Manchester's best kept secret. Best known for his self-titled, straightforward punk novelty, Jilted John, he also recorded an excellent album, True Love Stories. 15,000 copies were pressed, and it has also been released on CD, including two tracks by Jilted John's arch-nemesis, Gordon the Moron. Possibly one of the best albums of the UK punk invasion, the lesser-known tracks seemed to lean over to the side of '70s pop, with the classic humour of his self-titled song. Graham Fellows soon left his alias behind though. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jilted+John">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
