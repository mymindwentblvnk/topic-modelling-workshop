Pustota is a Polish black metal band, formed in 2009. The band uses the Czechian definition of the word Pustota, meaning 'desolation' or 'bleakness', and not the Polish definition which means 'carefreeness'. This was done in honour to Trist (who released a demo with the name 'Pustota'). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pustota">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
