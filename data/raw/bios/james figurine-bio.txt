Jimmy Tamborello is the man responsible for the project James Figurine and the musician behind the monikers of The Postal Service, Figurine and Dntel (as well as an earlier project Strictly Ballroom).

Whilst on tour in Germany with Figurine, Jimmy was subjected to weeks of nothing but dancefloor-oriented electro by a techno-loving driver. Never having been much of a fan before, all the bloops, blurps and drumbeats left a lasting impression on him, driving him to create his latest album; Mistake Mistake Mistake Mistake.

The record started out as an extra melodic, minimal techno record with some sparse vocals, but with Tamborello's techno-pop tendencies and a handful of celebrity chums like Rilo Kiley's Jenny Lewis and Erlend Ã˜ye of Kings of Convenience helping out, you can expect some melodic, indie-rific electronica.

Since the release of Mistake, Mistake, Mistake, Mistake, Jimmy has also released other recordings under the James Figurine moniker. Including a 2 song 7" called 'covers'. Available through plug research. Previous to that was  'Eleven Numbers' and 'Forgive your friend EP' both available through Monika Enterprise. Additional songs under the name James Figurine (as well as Dntel) have been released through his website (http://www.jimmytamborello.com). While the downloadable songs rotate, Jimmy has said they are to be released at a later date in a more mastered form. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/James+Figurine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
