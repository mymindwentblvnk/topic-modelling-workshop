Seeds Of Iblis emerges from Iraq, a land of war and religious oppression. The band is made of four members (two girls and two guys), risking their lives in the name of black metal. Their concept is to desecrate the principles of Islam. Musically, it is black metal influenced by Bathory, Mayhem, Sodom, Venom, Slayer and oriental music as well, with a raw and dark sound.

"The goals of Seeds Of Iblis are to show the world that Islam is dangerous, said Anahita, (who plays bass in the band) and even the people who live in the Middle East get hurt by this religion and seek for freedom of speech, just like the other people from all over the world."

Anahita (bass) also has his band Janaza, black metal, with anti islamic themes.

They are part of the Arabic Anti-Islamic Legion along with تدنيس (English: Tadnees, Saudi Arabia), Janaza (Iraq), False Allah (Bahrain) and مسجد الشيطان (English: Mosque Of Satan, Lebanon).
