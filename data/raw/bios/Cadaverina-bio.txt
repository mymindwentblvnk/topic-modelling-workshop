Constant impact and corrosive content. If Cadaverina was a medicine, these would most certainly be its side effects.
Created by Jonny Armani (Vocals, programming and percussion) Atila Ferreira (Guitars) and Daniel Neto (DJ and Backing Vocals) Cadaverina emerges in the local scene with the idea of mixing several musical styles such as industrial, eletrogoth and metal.
Formed in 2007 (in Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil), the band comes up with lyrics in Portuguese, with a dark inspiration of a claustrophobic and disconcerting world seen through the bloody retinas of a vampire.
With a detailed and well elaborated sound, together with heavy guitar riffs and guttural vocals, this mournful universe is dissected and exposed on lyrics that witness with literary refinement the mostly unaccepted absurd social reality.
In those mad times of great social disagreement, Cadaverina is for those who show no indifference to this unscrupulous reality.
