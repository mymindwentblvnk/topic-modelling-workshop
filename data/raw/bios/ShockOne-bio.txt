Since the release of 'The ShockOne EP' in 2009, which featured the chart topping 'Polygon', ShockOne has been one of the hottest names in bass music. 'Polygon' received major air-play worldwide with high-rotation play listing on Australia's Triple J radio and Radio 1's Annie Mac penning it as, 'The biggest drum and bass tune out'. The EPs three drum and bass tunes achieved the top 3 spots on Beatport's drum and bass chart, and 'Adachigahara's Theme' stayed at number 1 on the dubstep chart for over a month. Following this, ShockOne released his remix of the Brookes Brothers epic 'Crackdown' on Viper Recordings 'Acts of Madmen' LP which was labeled "Album of the Week" on Zane Lowe BBC Radio 1.

ShockOne followed up his debut EP with his highly anticipated 'Re-fix' EP, a collection of VIP's and remixes of the massively successful 'ShockOne EP'. The EP featured Phetsta's dubstep remix of 'True Believer' which was featured in Pendulum's 2010 Essential Mix on Radio 1, as well as the Dirtyphonics remix of 'Polygon' which was featured on Andy C's 'Nightlife 5' mix, as well as hitting #1 on the BBC 1Xtra charts. Following on success of two massive EPs under his belt, ShockOne's remix discography began rapidly expanding, with mixes for: Netsky, Chicane, Cutline, Mutya Buena & Agent X, Skepta, and Ayah Marar.

In mid-2011, ShockOne released 'Crucify Me', an epic drum & bass/dubstep anthem in which ShockOne also showed his versatility as a vocalist. The single which would serve as the first sneak peak at his forthcoming debut album, 'Universus'. This was followed by the second single, 'Relapse', a dubstep track featuring Sam Nafie on vocals, as well as a blazing dancefloor remix by Tantrum Desire.

Next on the horizon for ShockOne before dropping his LP is the third album single, the epic monster that is 'Chaos Theory', a track being cained by Knife Party at festivals and clubs all over the world. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ShockOne">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
