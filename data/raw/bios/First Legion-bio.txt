First Legion is a melodic metal band from Melbourneâ€™s eastern suburbs. Formed in late 2006, First Legion fuses fast thrash riffs with crushing breakdowns, while maintaining a solid melodic foundation.

The band's music, which draws influences from many areas - primarily European and American heavy metal, but also punk and hardcore - is led by powerful and aggressive, death/black metal vocals, and the end result is a refreshingly unique sound.

fter playing gigs all over Melbourne at venues including The Arthouse, Revolver Upstairs, The Barwon Club (Geelong), The Laundry, EV's Metalfest; and recently taking first place in a battle of the bands competition, First Legion is fast gaining a solid fan base across Melbourne and Geelong. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/First+Legion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
