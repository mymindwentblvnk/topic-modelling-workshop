This Scottish Metal band, formed in September 2003, has progressed into a mature outfit, characterised by strong melodies, thundering riffs and audacious arrangements. A tight knit group, musically and as friends, they are currently expanding their repertoire with songs drawn from the diverse base of influences within. Branching off into areas such as orchestrated metal and melodic death styles (though not without their own personal spin) are some of the things to come. This band promises more flair, more panache and more flamboyancy with every successive recording! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mourning+Star">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
