Freedom Call is a German power metal band formed in 1998. The band tours regularly and the current line-up includes two original members including lead vocalist and songwriter, Chris Bay. Freedom Call has released 12 albums in total, nine of these studio albums.

Biography:
Freedom Call's frontman Chris Bay gained a lot of his vocal ability from his grandfather, an opera singer with the Berlin State Opera, and his mother, who was a sought-after chorus singer. When only seven he began to play the guitar and by the time, he was, ten had tried his hand at the piano. Having played in various local rock bands, Bay moved to Hamburg in 1990 and got his first serious gig when he worked with Zed Yago. From 1993 to 1996 Chris was a member of former Victory guitarist Hermann Frank's band Moon Doc, with whom he recorded the albums "Moon Doc" (1995) and "Get Mooned" (1996).

Founding (1997–1998)
In 1998, Chris Bay and old friend Daniel Zimmermann formed Freedom Call during an off period for the latter's main band, Gamma Ray. The two had started writing songs together towards the end of 1997. They eventually completed a six-song demo Freedom Call with well-known producer Charlie Bauerfeind, who offered the tape to several record companies. At the same time, Ilker Ersin completed the Freedom Call line up on bass guitar and Sascha Gerstner on guitar. In 1998, Chris and Dan had seen Sascha playing in a cover band.

Stairway to Fairyland and Crystal Empire (1999–2001)
NTS Records released freedom Call’s debut album, Stairway to Fairyland on 7 May 1999. Stairway to Fairyland would sell over 35,000 copies. On 25 May 1999, Freedom Call made their live debut during a tour of France as support band for Angra and Edguy. At the end of August, Freedom Call commenced recording of the five-track mini LP Taragon. Taragon featured new songs, a cover version of Ultravox's "Dancing with Tears in My Eyes", a new version of "Stairway to Fairyland", a new version of "Tears of Taragon" with Biff Byford, singer with Saxon narrating the "Tale of Taragon" on it. There was also a bonus track for Japan called "Kingdom Come".

By the end of 1999, Freedom Call had entered the studio again to record their second album Crystal Empire, this released on 22 January 2001. Crystal Empire was promoted as the logical musical continuation of Stairway To Fairyland. In March 2001, Sascha Gerstner left Freedom Call (he would later join Helloween). Cédric “Cede” Dupont, the Swiss guitarist of Symphorce, eventually replaced Gerstner.

Eternity and The Circle of Life (2002–2006)
In the middle of January 2002, the new lineup began recording a new album called Eternity. Dan and Chris produced Eternity on their own this time, as Charlie Bauerfeind was not available. He was, however, responsible for the drum recordings and the final mix. Steamhammer released eternity on 3 June 2002.

Later that year, Freedom Call was invited on tour with Blind Guardian. During this tour they recorded the live album, Live Invasion together with Charlie Bauerfeind in Düsseldorf, Stuttgart and Munich. Live Invasion was released on 10 May 2004 by SPV. The keyboard player on this tour, Nils Neumann, was soon invited to become the fifth member of the band. After an extended break, the next album The Circle of Life was recorded at Hansen Studio, Hamburg and FC Studios, Nuremberg from August to October 2004. The Circle of Life was released on 21 May 2005 by SPV. Shortly after the release of The Circle of Life, both Cédric "Cede" Dupont and Ilker Ersin decided to leave Freedom Call (independently of each other). Replacements were eventually announced in the respective form of the unknown Lars Rettkowitz and Armin Donderer, formerly of Paradox.

Dimensions (2007–2008)
A new album with the title Dimensions was released on 20 April 2007. Commenting on Dimensions, Daniel Zimmerman said: "Even if the two predecessors, Eternity and The Circle of Life, took very different directions, both albums had a number of strong moments. Dimensions combine the most successful elements from both albums, in other words: we included our penchant for fast and very melodic numbers from Eternity with the more contemporary, bombastic components of The Circle of Life." The songs "The Wanderer" and "Dimensions" were also used in the online rhythm game "Flash Flash Revolution".

Legend of the Shadowking and Land of the Crimson Dawn (2009–2012)
In March 2009, the band announced that they were putting the final additions to a new album, Legend of the Shadowking, and that they had parted ways with bassist Armin Donderer, who would be replaced by Samy Saemann. Legend of the Shadowking was released on 29 January 2010 by SPV.

For the 2010 touring cycle, Dan Zimmerman announced that Klaus Sperling would replace him, as during this time he (Zimmerman) would be on the road with Gamma Ray. It was later confirmed on the band's website that Zimmermann had officially left the band. Live in Hellvetia was the first live DVD by Freedom Call. It was released on 20 May 2011 by SPV. Live in Hellvetia was recorded on 29 December 2010 in Z7 Pratteln, Switzerland. The title of the next Freedom Call studio album, Land of the Crimson Dawn, was announced in September 2011.
