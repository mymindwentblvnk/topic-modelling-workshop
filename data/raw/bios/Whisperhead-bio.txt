Whisperhead is a metal band ‘with a twist’, hailing from the Netherlands, with black metal heritage.

The band consists of two people: Sademaara and Shagra, with Sademaara composing as well as playing all the instruments, and Shagra writing the lyrics and performing the vocals.

The Whisperhead concept was first conceived during the summer of 2011 with the idea of combining science fiction storytelling and music. For the 'The Presage'-trilogy, most of our inspiration has been and continues to be drawn from the Warhammer 40,000 universe and the Norwegian black metal movement of the early 1990s.
