[1] Druid was a progressive rock band that included Neil Brewer on bass guitar, Andrew McCrorie-Shand on keyboards, Cedric Sharpley on drums and percussion and ‘Dane’ on guitar and vocals. In 1975 they released their debut-LP Towards the Sun and a year later a second album entitled Fluid Druid.
Their first effort featured fluent and melodic songs, layered with mellotron, often in combination with sensitive electric guitar work. The echoes from Yes are obvious: lots of vocal harmonies, a Chris Squire-like bass, Wakemanesque keyboards and even the high-pitched vocals like Jon Anderson. But Druid's music was less complex and virtuosic, their pleasant sound appeals to many, more than the 24-carat Yes-clone Starcastle. Fluid Druid was in the vein of their first but less mature.
