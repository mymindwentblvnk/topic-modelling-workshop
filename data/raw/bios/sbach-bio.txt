sBACH is the project of Spencer Seim, axe-man for Hella and drummer for The Advantage.

From label's press release:
"sBACH by sBACH is a frenetic m√©lange akin to the collective sights, sounds and sugar rushes in the heads of an entire elementary school being locked into a Chuck E. Cheese franchise while having to subside on an all you can eat buffet of Fun Dip and Pixie Stix as the animatronic band dishes out phosphorescent doom riffs while running amok with the blips and bleeps." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/sBACH">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
