UNDEAD CREEP came alive during the horrible, torrid summer of 2009 Anno Satanas. Forced to come out of the catacombs where their decomposed bodies used to lie, pushed by the urge to bring back the spirit of old school death metal the way it was meant to be, the four-piece combo from Palermo, Italy is ready to leave a trail of doom and total destruction on their path. The first EP, Undead Creep, is out now: get it before it's too late! THE GATES ARE OPEN FOR YOU TO SEE THE HORROR OF THE UNDEAD CREEP!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Undead+Creep">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
