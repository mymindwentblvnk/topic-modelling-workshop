A mix of bitter and salty instrument sounds, with honey-laced melodies and loop pedals, is brought to us by the new anti/folk indie/rock act, Luckless.

Luckless adds loop pedals and atmospherics to an unvarnished vocal sound to create crafted, layered music with an unrefined, naïve edge.  References to artists such as PJ Harvey, Iron & Wine and Cat Power abound.  Four track tape recorders, old organs and valve amplifiers have created warmth throughout Luckless’s otherwise rough, raw arrangements.  Some Luckless songs groove, while others take pause and reflect.  Holding it all together is a sense of detachment and isolation, with Rossiter’s eerie vocals a common thread throughout.

Luckless is a collaboration between Will Wood and Ivy Rossiter. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Luckless">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
