Stovokor is a death metal band from Portland, Oregon (USA). Its five members are Bill Salfelder ("plnluH Hod"), vocals; Merlin Carson ("Che'ron muchwl'"), lead guitar; Ward Young ("KhR'ELL"), rhythm guitar, Jason Lewis ("Khraa'Nik"), bass guitar; and Jason Johansen ("Qui Pe"), drums.

The band is named for Sto-vo-kor, the afterlife of Star Trek's fictional aliens the Klingons but, despite acknowledging a debt to Klingon-themed karaoke [1], the band insist they are Klingons, refuse to make appearances out of costume and sing only in Klingon.

"Klingons are very macho, very militaristic, and metal is definitely their music. We dress up as Klingons when we perform," said Guitarist Young in 2003.

The band was featured in the documentary Trekkies 2. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stovokor">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
