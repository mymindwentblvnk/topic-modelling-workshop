Describing his current sound as trip-hop with an abstract twist, Ash incorporates an intoxicatingly heavy dub reggae bottom end with samples of original material – all firmly rooted in jazz harmony.

As a DJ, Ash has long performed in support of acts such as The Specials, Lee Scratch Perry, and David Rodigan, but now signed to Deep Heads, his productions are receiving the increased attention they deserve. His association with the label has in fact already led to his providing a remix for the track ‘All That You Are’ by label boss Zeb Samuels & Rowl, featuring Gilles Peterson-approved vocalist Segilola.

Clearly an incredibly gifted and hardworking musician, Ash Walker is set for a bright future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ash+Walker">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
