Two Second Hate Hails From America's NorthWest Region. Hate Ground Zero If You Will. Two Veteran Musicians, Fucking Sick Of Trying To Cope With Egos, Attitudes, Natural Band Chaos, And Frustrated To No End With Trying Again And Again To No Avail Or Positive Result, Have Stepped Up On Their Own To Do What Until Now Has Exceeded Any Band's Grasp. In The Method Of Behemoth, Annihilator, Ministry, Fear Factory And The List Goes On And On......Mark D states,"We Approach This Project With Like Minds And Less People To Blame. We Do This The Way It Was Meant To Be, For Us!..." Two Second Hate Members, Matt Connett & Mark D. Must Wear Many Musical Masks To Achieve The Sonic Aggression That Is Concurrently Moody As Well As Brutal. Both Members Work With Existing Projects, Though As Far As THIS Style Goes.......It Starts And Ends HERE!........."We Trust Others Will Appreciate The Effort As Well As The Music To Come. Keep It BRUTAL!!...TWO SECOND HATE" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TWO+SECOND+HATE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
