Morior Invictus is a group of guys (and girl) with one thing in mind – Fighting on God’s frontlines in this spiritual warfare that is destroying today’s society. The name Morior Invictus comes from the Latin phrase which means “Death before defeat,” which is a perfect name for this group as their mindset is to win this war, or die trying. You might recognize the members or the music under another name, Against The Opposition. The band has grown tremendously in a spiritual and musical way since the conception of Against The Opposition and has decided to expand the opportunity of ministry under a new name.

Having recently signed with Raging Storm Records, Morior Invictus will be going on tour soon and plans to release a full length album as well.  Their first single under their new name is now available for download on iTunes.
