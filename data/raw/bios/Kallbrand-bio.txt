Kallbrand was formed in 2007 by Claes Palm and Johan Lundh with the intention to mix Black Metal with scandinavian folk music and acoustic instruments, with lyrics dealing with folklore, nature and anti-christianity. Three songs was recorded at occult studios in the spring of 2008. Pontus Bergstr√∂m joined the lineup as a full-time member in summer 2008 and will be participating in the songwriting for new recordings. With the new songs Kallbrand are heading for a darker and more primitive approach, songs are being wirtten and will in due time be recorded and presented on a proper demo.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kallbrand">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
