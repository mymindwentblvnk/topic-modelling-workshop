Drawing members from the Scottish Grind, Crust and Hardcore scenes they formed in early 2010 with a view to sounding as claustrophobic, intense and violent as could be achieved, Sunsmasher immediately established themselves as a titanic live experience, playing amongst Grind and Hardcore bands, their confrontational Doom and Sludge noise-hell strikes a note at a fraction of the pace but thrice the heaviness. Coming across like a smash up of Iron Monkey, Electric Wizard, Melvins and Sleep, and due to release a 5 track demo imminently, the Mammothian Loud Cult is coming and they are sickened by you!
