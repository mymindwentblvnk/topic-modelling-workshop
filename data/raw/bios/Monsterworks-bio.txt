MONSTERWORKS began from seeds sown by a trio brought together in a mutual and equal respect for Deicide and Queen. Originally based in Wellington, New Zealand, Jono and Ian from the kiwi line-up are currently 'avin it large in London with their English mates / bandmembers Hugo and James. In no uncertain terms MONSTERWORKS has always stood for and works towards the glory of metal, and pies.

IMAGE IS NOTHING; METAL IS EVERYTHING.
