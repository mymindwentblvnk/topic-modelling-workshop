Trencher is a band from London creating a particular Grindcore sound. But think of it as a band without guitar player and with a casio-tone toy keyboard. Original and with character. Like old DIY grindcore bands, but darker, and sometimes, rather more experimental. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trencher">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
