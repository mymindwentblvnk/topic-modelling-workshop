Whats up we're Lytle Creek, a death metal/black metal band from Rialto, CA, and hunting for a new sound out there. Lytle Creek formed early June, and is still together strong. It all started when Michael, Chris, and former bassist Johnny, wanted to get a new band together. Michael had known someone who could play drums. He admitted he wasnt the greatest, but he could catch on quick. Getting better and better each day, Tyler came into the band. Soon after we decided, to go with a more creepier sound, so we decided to get a keyboardist. Looking far and wide, posting up all around myspace, we finally found Jon. He played really well and we got along quick. Soon after that, we decided to start writting songs, and by the end of the summer we had written 4 songs, but shortly after that, Johnny had to leave the band, for personal reasons. Then started a search for a bassist, and we didnt have to look to far. Jon knew someone who might be down, named Fidel. Not too long after, we found a guitarist named Bobby, who played amazingly well. He was perfect, he was fresh and had a chill attitude. Unfortunatly, for personal reasons Mike has left the band, and fidel as well. We are now looking for a new lead singer. But even with struggles, we're as strong as when we started, and we continue to make music WE like to hear, that will currupt your mind, and give you nightmares when you sleep. Lytle Creek will prevail as long as we can and have fun till the end. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lytle+Creek">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
