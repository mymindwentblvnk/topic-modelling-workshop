Twilight Force are a Swedish symphonic power metal band known for their highly fantastical lyrics and LARP-style outfits which the band performs onstage in. The band's main lyrical themes are based on the lore of a fictional world known as The Twilight Kingdoms, created by keyboardist Daniel Beckman. 

The band members play under the use of nicknames, and wear costumes on stage that mirror the band's lyrical themes. The group describes themselves as "adventure metal," in part due to the use of costumes, props, and demeanor onstage. The band has cited early role-playing games like Heroes of Might & Magic and table-top role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons as inspiration for their appearance. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Twilight+Force">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
