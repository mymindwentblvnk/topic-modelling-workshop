In the year 2006, a new page was turned in history when a band named Beatcoffin Bastard took its first steps. The band was founded by Paulus Akujärvi (bass), Joonas Mäki-Kokkila (drums), Ilari Gröhn (guitar) and Sakari Ikonen (guitar). In autumn 2006 Sami Pehkonen took the singer's place in the band.

The band performed its first gig in early 2007. The band fired Joonas after few gigs and Tuomas Miettinen took his place.

The band's first demo "Until The Last Nail" saw daylight in february 2008. After finishing the demo Tuomas left the band and Antti Nevalainen came to replace him. Soon after this Sami and Paulus left the band. Ilari started the singing and the band had some gigs with temporary bass players.

Sami came back to the band in november 2008 and the band started working with new songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beatcoffin+Bastard">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
