About She Was Asking For It

Founded in the early days of 2006, SWAFI is one of the first bulgarian projects to explore the entrails of melodic metalcore. Their main influences come from bands such as Atreyu, As I Lay Dying or Unearth, with the idea to combine brutal hard-core oriented vocals with melodic riffs based on old school metal bands. The band's lyrics and ideas are focused on dark states of mind, but without treating specific social issues such as politics or religion. The goal of such approach is that everyone who listens to their music should be able to find their own way to understand it. Their stage debut is on the 19th of June, in O! Shipka club (Sofia), 4 months after starting rehearsals, and with barely no time to get together, because of the busy schedules of all six members of the project. A succesfull start though, promissing a good base for further developement of bands in this genre. In the following months, the band records a demo-song ("Hurt") in Sub Zero Studios, where they also rehearse, and then play live a couple of times more, in Sofia and Plovdiv. After playing gigs mainly in Sofia for a year and a half, the band goes into the studio at the end of spring - 2008 to release their first LP - "The Downfall of Mankind", which came with a video for the song with the same title. By the end of the summer, Danio and Gruby (Lubo) left the band, and Danny (ex- Just) and Ivo (Let Them Die) came to fill the empty spots. Currently SWAFI are working on new songs, looking to change the direction into something a bit heavier and deeper.
