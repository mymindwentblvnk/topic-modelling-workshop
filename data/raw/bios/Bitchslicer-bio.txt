Philadelphia powerhouse, Bitchslicer, isn’t your typical thrash band. Their "Fuck Yeah" sound is part King Gary’s lightning fast guitar riffs with chaotic leads peeling into screaming harmonics that churn back to the crustiest head-banging progressions, often countered by Justin’s full complex basslines that hold their own with molten leads and breaks unlike anything you’ve heard...all while Antman’s ballsout super-tempo drumming does more than punctuate as he brings the feel of each song together with heavy-hitting insanity. It just keeps getting faster, better and heavier.

Everything about Bitchslicer is relentlessly aggressive from their superior do it yourself production, to their diehard work ethic to the powerful performance they give no matter what the venue.
