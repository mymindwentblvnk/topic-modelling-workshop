Mike Napolitano was giving Kris Novak guitar lessons in the summer of 2010. One day he said 'let's start a band!'. We recorded some riffs and added a drum track. Mike played the recording for a drummer he knew. The drummer's name was Buzz King and Buzz saw some potential. Buzz played in a band called Shakin' Michael J who had a rehearsal studio in Queen Anne. 

The three met there to rehearse one night and hammered out the 3 songs that started it all. Soon after that, a vocalist by the name of Earl Unong was introduced. Shortly after that a bass player, Evan Americh started jamming with the band. The band was named after the infamous '27 club' ( Famous musicians that died in the prime of their careers at the age of 27 of overdoses, gun shot wounds, drownings, etc.). We all agreed that shortening Dead At 27 to DA 27 was a good idea to differentiate Mike's old band 'Dead at 27' with the new band 'DA 27'. 

We played a handful of shows and got a good response. Earl Unong abruptly left the band in June of 2011 because of personal reasons and was replaced by Sacramento transplant Ken 'Kin' Furtado that same month. In August of 2011 the band recorded an album called 'Gallows'. We continue to play shows and have high aspirations to do a lot more.
