The existing Slave Zero line up consists of: Eddie O'Malley (Guitars), Graeme V. Flynn (Vocals), Karol Kosc (Bass) and Ben Wanders (Drums). Their latest offering ‘Exempt from all Tolerance’ sees them moving in a more progressive and technically proficient direction which will undoubtedly push the band and its listeners to a new level of expectation. 

Since forming in Kilkenny in 2000, the band's powerful, energetic live performances coupled with extensive touring throughout Ireland and Europe has gained them respect in the underground scene. This has generated opportunities to support acts such as Hatebreed, Exodus, Fozzy, Soilent Green, Misery Index ,Cephalic Carnage and Desecration to name a few. Their persistent desire to push boundaries and perpetual drive in spreading their music has attracted critical acclaim from publications such as Terrorizer, Metal Maniacs, and Brutallica and the band were even short-listed for the 2006 top ten unsigned acts in BW&BK Magazine. 

The relentless work ethic of Slave Zero, combined with their competent and professional attitude is further reinforced with the latest release ‘Exempt from all Tolerance’. The band’s DIY work ethic has ensured many successful years together. 

New EP 'Disambiguated Visionary' due for release in November 2013.
