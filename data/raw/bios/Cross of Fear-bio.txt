Cross of Fear was born to make a kind of music that should be as good to play as it is to hear. With fast and exciting riffs and a great vocal, the band has a strong influence of bands like Judas Priest and Manowarand it promises loyalty to the true Heavy Metal fans.

It's first demo, "Holy War Pt. I", was recorded at the Digisound studio, with the production of Rodrigo Magnani and Fabrício Carvalho, and it has as special guests Rildevar Silva (Alliance) in "Total Earthquake" and Fabrício Carvalho (Tiglath and Somberlain) em "Cross of Fear".
