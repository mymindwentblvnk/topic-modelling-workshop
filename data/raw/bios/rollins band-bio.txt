Rollins Band was an American rock band from 1987 to 2006, formed in Van Nuys, California and led by former Black Flag vocalist Henry Rollins. They are best known for the songs "Low Self Opinion" and "Liar", which both earned heavy airplay on MTV in the early-mid 1990s. Music critic Steve Huey describes their style as "uncompromising, intense, cathartic fusions of funk, post-punk, noise, and jazz experimentalism, with Rollins shouting angry, biting self-examinations and accusations over the grind." In 2000, Rollins Band was included on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock, ranking at No. 47. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rollins+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
