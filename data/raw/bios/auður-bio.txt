Auður is a female name which means ‘wealth’. Frontman Auðunn Lúthersson took up the name as a token of respect to all the women who have had to use male pseudonyms throughout history. Auður was massively inspired when he saw James Blake perform in Reykjavík and immediately started composing modern electronic pop. Although he has only released one EP, his talent has not gone unnoticed and he has signed big publishing deals and performed on both sides of the Atlantic.
