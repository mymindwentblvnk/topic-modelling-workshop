Venom P. Stinger is an overpowering quartet formed in Melbourne, Australia, 1985, who morphed out of one scorched-earth, rawer-than-raw band Sick Things,  the Fungus Brains and Brainshack. The band lasted until when Jim and Mick went on play as part of instrumental trio, the Dirty Three, and in 1996 they  disbanded. In 2010 they started playing again with Tim Evans as vocalist, Dugald, the original singer died in 2004. Over the course of this period they released several LPs, a 45 and one 4-song CD-EP. "Nowhere have I heard a band so desperately trapped in their own skin - militaristic, brutally loud and often atonal rock. Their singer, Dugald McKenzie's rawest mouth-rasp vocals imaginable, and not only was it difficult to imagine him singing without his neck veins popping halfway to China, it was difficult to hear his deep-accented wails and think him anything but Australian. Drummer Jim White usually sounded like he was stuck somewhere between drumming for the Daughters of the American Revolution parade and for later-period John Coltrane. Even when the songs didn’t fall together all that well – and their albums do have some filler – they never wavered from a mood that was dark, angry and ballistic. Even on the (rare) slow ones."
