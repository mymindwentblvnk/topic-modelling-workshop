Coming from the Swiss Alps, going global: Cédric Streuli aka Buvette is about to shake up the pop music landscape. The 25 year old is weaving electronic, equally bright and mild sounds into rhythmically challenging patterns, enrichening them with his voice. With catchy and fearless numbers like «Benzi Blues», Buvette has shared the stage with anti-stars like Devendra Banhart, noise heroes like Black Dice and Holy Fuck and contemporary musicians like Atlas Sound or Toro y Moi. Buvette has played New York as well as the Montreux Jazz Festival – while publishing some of the most distinctive and open-minded Swiss music on his label: Rowboat.
