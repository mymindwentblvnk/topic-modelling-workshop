There are several artists called Skeptik.

1. A band from Duisburg, Germany, whose style can be best described as progressive death / progressive thrash metal. The band started out as a threepiece in 2005 and was called Dreadnought. Years later, the three founding members William (bass / vocals), Lawrence (guitar) and Hanno (drums) recruited Marcus (bass) to replace William, who turned from bass to guitar. After Marcus left the band, Skeptik recorded their Demo Decline and Fall in 2010, with William recording the basslines.

In November 2010, Stefan (bass) and Julian (guitar) were recruited, so that William could concentrate on his singing duties.
