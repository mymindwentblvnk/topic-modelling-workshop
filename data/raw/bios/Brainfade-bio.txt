W.A.T.E.R. is the first name to the one-man project by Anton Nikolaev Slavov, the virtuoso young guitarist from the little town of Stara Zagora in Bulgaria, later renamed to "BRAINFADE"

With playing style including heavy fast paced thrash riffs, melodic heavy metal sections, neo-classical, shredding solos and technical fret work he achieves a state of art metal.

In many interviews he states that his playing is influenced by the most common guitar prodigies - Yngwie J. Malmsteen, Marty Friedman , Gary Moore, Jeff Loomis, John Petrucci. The Swedish Shred God was the thing that made him start playing the guitar. With riff driven passages containing the heaviness and punch from his influence by Dave Mustaine, Matt Heafy, Andy LaRocque, Jeff Waters, Mille Petrozza the result is a metal that will almost surely make you headbang.

With a lot of metaphorical lyrics about the dark themes of war, "society's impurity",everyday life and social problems, "BRAINFADE" reveals the brutality of the world surrounding us.

Anton's working on the moment on his first record - a 4 track CD called "Black Tides".

The track listing:

1. Victim 
2. From The Sewers
3. Brainfade
4. Sand In Your Wounds
