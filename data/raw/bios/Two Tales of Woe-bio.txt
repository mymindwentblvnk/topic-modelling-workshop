Since 2001, the concept for TTOW was on the mindset of Carl King. In 2005 this became a reality when King calabirated with Lar Bowler to develope the direction and sound of what was to become Two Tales of Woe. In the fall of 2007, Ross Duffy, Chris De Brabandere and Johnny Kerr solidified the bands Line Up. TTOW quickly made a name for themselves as a hard working Live act in the Irish Metal Scene. Throughout 2008, writing and rehearings began for the debut album, "A Conversation with Death". Recording began in August of that year. By January 2009, the work on the album, which was self produced and recorded by the band, was complete and ready to be launched by mid February. Two Tales of Woe plan to promote the album extensively over as much ground as the band can possibly cover. Currently we are in search for a full time drummer as Johnny can no longer commit time to the band due to his own commitments, but we still soldier on in this City of Doom!!
