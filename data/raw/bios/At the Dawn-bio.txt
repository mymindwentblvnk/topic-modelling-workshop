At the Dawn is a recently formed power metal band from Italy.  The band was formed in 2011 and shortly thereafter released an EP entitled Countdown to Infinity in 2012.  Now with the dawn of a new year, the band has offered up their first full-length effort named From Dawn to Dusk.

Here is the band's bio with credits going to the band's Facebook page:

Quote:
At The Dawn were born from a Michele Viaggi’s idea in the spring of 2011 in Imola, a town near Bologna (Italy), which has a long tradition regarding metal music.

The Michele’s wish was to create a metal band with several aspects, with no presumption of being able to tell something new in a genre on which has been said a lot, but also trying to be original avoiding the mistake to pay attention on technique in confront of melody.

At this point Michele called his old friends:
Michele Vinci on guitar, Vittorio Zappone on bass guitar and Mattia Ughi on drums, then they worked together searching for the right frontman, identified in Stefano De Marco.

Thanks to a perfect feeling among the five, the first original songs are born quickly, enriched by orchestral arrangements to which they dedicated a lot of time and resources.

In April 2012 the At The Dawn published their first release: “Countdown to infinity”.
