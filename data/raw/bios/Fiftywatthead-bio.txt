Formed in 1999, Fiftywatthead are not overnight sensations. The Windsor, Ontario quartet had previously released two albums: "Volume One” and “Rock n Roll Killer” before unleashing their latest installment, Fogcutter; an album described in Metal Edge Magazine as "not only one of the heaviest...but also one of the more impressive."

Fiftywatthead have gained the reputation as "Canada's heaviest band" and they have been compared to the likes of Mastodon, High on Fire and Neurosis.  

The band is currently recording a new album, set to be released on Signed By Force in 2010.
