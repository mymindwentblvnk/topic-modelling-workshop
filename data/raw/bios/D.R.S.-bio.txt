Mainly known for his work with Strategy and Konny Kon as part of "Broke N' English", and his collaborations with drum and bass artists LTJ Bukem and Calibre.

Their widely-anticipated 2010 album, Schizophrendia, marked the beginning of a new satirical rap era.  Well known for their studio demands, DRS requires a steady supply of Carlo Rossi wine, Sriracha sauce, and Sumatra coffee grounds.  DRS is currently working on their upcoming 2011 sophomore album.
