was consisted by Tolis B .(Necrovorous,ex-Inveracity,ex-Traced),George K. (Stagnate) ,Mechblastess (Devathorn),John P. (ex-Traced,Stagnate) and George N. (Stagnate) destined to play music under the same truth and reality,aspect .
The line up has changed and Vagelis F. (Necrovorous,Embrace of Thorns)
took the place on the drums,recording the first Resurgency demo ,titled
"Dark Revival" in July 2010. The purpose of the band is to reach, the lost chaotic realms of darkness..its true meaning...and ressurect, the past and the forgotten..
