Bon Iver's Justin Vernon has unveiled a rap side project called Jason Feathers.

The project is a collaboration between Vernon and American MC Astronautalis, with Bon Iver bandmate S. Carey also in the mix.

There's lots of autotune, singing that channels another of Vernon's projects, Volcano Choir, and also some performance in character: Vernon assumed the role of "heavily-seasoned guitar-crooning lost-cowboy" Ephasis, Carey goes by the name of Toothpick, and Astronautalis turns into the titular Jason Feathers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Feathers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
