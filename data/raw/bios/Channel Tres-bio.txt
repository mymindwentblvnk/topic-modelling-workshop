Channel Tres is a producer, DJ, musician and artist from Compton, California whose style and aesthetic is quickly making him one of the most buzz-worthy talents to hit the scene. Channel Tres fell in love with the art of music and production at the early age of nine when he stumbled across a CD entitled "The Love Below". From that moment, he knew he wanted to make and be a part of how music inspires people. He started playing drums and directing the church choir as a teenager. Then his desire to explore further music connections led him to attend University in Oklahoma where he studied music technology, composition and theory. His education only broadened his knowledge and love for the craft and set him on a path to create music that is clearly outside of the box. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Channel+Tres">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
