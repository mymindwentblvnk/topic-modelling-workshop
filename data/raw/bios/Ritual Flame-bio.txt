Ritual Flame is a solo project by Andrew Sares of Sledgehammer Autopsy. The first demo mixed elements of funeral doom, death/doom and industrial but later songs reflect more of a funeral doom/dark ambient hybrid. Though there may be slight changes in the sound Andrew has only one goal: slow, heavy, doomy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ritual+Flame">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
