"The news was going to be that Scrufizzer is hanging up the mic and giving up the grime production. Although as a lot of grime fans will be thankful to hear, after talks with Universal today, it looks like he will be reconsidering his plans. Not everyone may have caught all the work Scrufizzer has been putting in so far in 2010 doing Stage shows with DJ Cameo and other live events, recording, producing and putting in the hard work. We really enjoyed this release heâ€™s put out, so download and check it out."- taken from grimeforum homepage
