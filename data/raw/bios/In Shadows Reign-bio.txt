In Shadows Reign was formed by 4 headbanging maniacs, as the group wanted to play their favorite music, Metal!

They quickly started doing shows at local venues and got praised by fans as a brutal live act.

Soon the band started incorporating Rock, Hardcore and various elements of music to hone their sound and become the band they always wanted to be!

With the 2008 release of their debut demo, "Phoenix", the band has proven a strong Up-and-Coming Metal band, and proved they're a force to be reckoned with.
