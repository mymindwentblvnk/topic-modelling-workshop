1. Piranha is a Bulgarian skate-hardcore-punk band, formed in 2011.

2. Piranha was formed by Paul Baloff after he got replaced by Steve ''Zetro'' Souza in Exodus. They recorded a demo in '88, but Paul soon went on to sing in Heathen. Andy Andersen replaced him but the band eventually fell apart. After Paul recored a demo with Heathen he returned back to reform the band in '89 with a brand new line-up. Later on, when Tom Hunting (ex-Exodus) joined the band, they recorded another demo with four songs, but Paul was unfortunately ''never around'' to record the vocal tracks. After a few line-up changes the band broke up in '93.
