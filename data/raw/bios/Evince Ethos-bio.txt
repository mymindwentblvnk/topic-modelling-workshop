Evince Ethos has gone through many a line-up change since its 
formation in 2005, and with that, many a change in sound. The band draws many of 
its influences from European metal outfits such as Nightwish, Within Temptation, 
Kamelot, and Epica, and female-fronted rock acts in the US such as Evanescence. 
Remaining members of the original 2009 line-up include Mercy Roulette (Jessica 
Jackson) on vocals, Todd Miller on lead guitar, and Kevin H. Brady on bass. In 
2009 (when the line-up included keyboardist Keith Dombrowski, guitarist 
Sebastian Dill, and drummer Brad Berk), the band produced a self-titled EP which 
never saw its way to post-production, but was released nonetheless by way of the 
internet. The EP promptly made its way onto a number of music blogs and web 
radio programs, until creative differences forced the band's separation. Now in 
2011, the band is determined to re-emerge on the New England scene, and has been 
rehearsing with a new line-up of players, to be announced sometime 
this summer. The included tracks are from the 2009 self-titled EP. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Evince+Ethos">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
