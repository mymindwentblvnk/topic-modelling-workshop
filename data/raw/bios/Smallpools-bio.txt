Smallpools is an indie pop/alternative band from Los Angeles, CA, United States. Forming in early 2013, the group released their debut single "Dreaming" on RCA Records, May 21, 2013. Thanks to catchy guitar hooks and internet blogs, Smallpools' "Dreaming" is now spreading like wildfire. "Dreaming" skyrocketed to the top of the HypeMachine chart in just hours. Dreaming had hit over 20,000 plays on Soundcloud before the band even hit 500 "likes" on Facebook (Stereofox). Producing dangerously catchy dance oriented indie music, comparable to that of Passion Pit and Youngblood Hawke, Smallpools appeared to be destined for more than just #1 on HypeMachine.

On July 16, 2013, 3 days after the band's first show, Smallpools released their eponymous debut EP. The record included Dreaming and 3 new songs, "Mason Jar", "Over & Over" and "No Story Time". Smallpools spent the summer supporting Australian indie popsters, San Cisco, on their first U.S. Headline tour. Later that year, Smallpools toured in support of Cincinnati, Ohio indie popsters and label mates Walk the Moon, and also in support of another Cincinnati indie pop group, twenty one pilots.

The group's debut album, Lovetap!, was released on March 20, 2015. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Smallpools">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
