Tropkillaz are a Brazilian electronic duo formed by DJ's DJ Zegon and Laudz.

DJ Zegon is one of Brazil’s most respected producers and DJs of all time. Former member of N.A.S.A., DJ Zegon’s career spans over 20 years with credits on over 100 records with artists such as Kanye West, M.I.A., David Byrne (Talking Heads), George Clinton, and a few Wu Tang Members (RZA, Method Man, Ol’Dirty Bastard) among others.

Laudz has already worked with rap stars like Snoop Dogg, Dr Dre, as well as the main MCs of Brazil’s new hip hop scene, and has done scores for mives and video-games.

The result of this junction is an intense collection of club bangers that blend many styles from bass with hip hop, latin and baile funk music.

The workaholic duo have been busy releasing tune after tune weekly in their Soundcloud, reaching millions of plays worldwide.

In December 2013, the Tropkillaz remix to N.A.S.A’s “Hide” hit #1 on the iTunes Electronic Music Charts in the USA, and peaked at #8 in the UK – further showing that Tropkillaz are heavyweight contenders, charting amongst artists like Disclosure, Major Lazer, M.I.A, amongst others.

Supported by superstars DJs like Diplo, Major Lazer, Flosstradamus, DJ Snake, Steve Aoki, and having performed in over 30 different countries, Tropkillaz have now signed to a major label and are ready to take their heat worldwide. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tropkillaz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
