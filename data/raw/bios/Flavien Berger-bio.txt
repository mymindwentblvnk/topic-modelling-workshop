This self-taught musician creates sentimental stories through wordplay and has always been interested in testing swirling sounds, fiddling with engines and making unusual musical hybrids. Berger appeared as a breath of fresh air on the French scene, and specialises in music with aquatic influences, best example is his first album Leviathan, which came out in 2015 on Parisian label Pan European Recordings.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flavien+Berger">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
