Libethra delivers a progressive mixture of doom and black metal. TijaD together with Roel, both members of the currently dormant black metal band "...of Melancholy Burning", started Libethra in 2011. The current line up of Libethra was completed with the addition of Job on guitar and Sander as main vocalist and bass player (from the band Excerius). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Libethra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
