Zoser Mez was a project/band led by then-ex-Mercyful Fate guitarists Hank Shermann and Michael Denner, with their sole album's release occuring just prior to MF reuniting in the early nineties (this project may well have been the catalyst for that reformation). Drummer Bjarne Holm (listed here as a guest) and bassist Claus Weiergang have together and separately spent time in several Shermann-based projects over the years, such as Gutrix, Virus 7, and (most recently) Force Of Evil. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zoser+Mez">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
