Bobby Krlic is a British musician, producer and soundtrack composer currently based in Los Angeles. Krlic was born and raised in Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England. He studied Music and Visual Arts at the University of Brighton. From 2009 to 2013 he released music under the name The Haxan Cloak.

After The Haxan Cloak's  2013 album "Excavation", Krlic put the project on hold in order to focus on producing other artists (most notably Bj√∂rk) and composing film music under his own name. In 2019 his soundtrack for Ari Aster's film "Midsommar" brought him the attention of a wider audience.

A new Haxan Cloak album in the works, as well as collaborations with Father John Misty's Josh Tillman and plans to launch his own label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+Krlic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
