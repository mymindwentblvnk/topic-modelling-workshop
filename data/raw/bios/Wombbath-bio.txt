Wombbath is a death metal band, formed in Sala, Sweden in 1990 under the name Seizure. As they heard that their band name was already taken they changed it to the more original and creative Wombbath. After having released one 7" EP and a full-length album (Internal Caustic Torments) through the French labels Thrash and Infest Records they were offered a contract for one mini album and one full-length album by Austrian company Napalm Records. After having sent a new demo to the bigger labels Earache, Roadrunner and Century Media without any result the guys decided to take their offer. The mini album was done directly from their demo recording which Napalm thought good enough to release. After having recorded and sent new material for the full-length album Napalm boss Max never got back to them and was completely unreachable. The band sent some of the new songs to the bigger labels but without any result. After these unfortunate events the band was losing their enthusiasm and after another demo they broke up in 1995. However, that final two song demo was praised by a band hunter from Warner Bros Records. Wombbath reformed in 2010 for a Texas tour, and there is potentially new material in the works.

Downfall Rising was the first full-length album since 1993's Internal Caustic Torments.  It was released in 2015.  They released splits with Revel in Flesh, Departed Souls and Obscure Infinity after Downfall Rising was released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wombbath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
