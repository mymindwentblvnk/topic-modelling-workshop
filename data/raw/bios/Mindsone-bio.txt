Biography
Innovative lyrics, heart pounding instrumentals, and intense live shows are what MindsOne has been offering their listeners since 2002. Their music embodies the spirit of the culture and pays homage to those that have come before them. In 2006, the duo released an EP, "The Time Space Continuum", that was hailed as a breath of fresh air by the Southeastern Hip Hop community. The project propelled them into the NC Hip Hop scene and beyond.  In 2008, MindsOne came fully armed with "Transitions," their first full lengh LP.  It received rave reviews from various publications and led to a successful East Coast tour that ranged from NC to NY."Transitions" was recorded at Chung King Studios in NYC, known for its wealth in Hip Hop recording history. The album didn't merely aim to recapture the essence of classic HipHop artistry, but instead aimed to established its own identity through the uniquely progressive production and cutting-edge lyricism. In the meantime, MindsOne has been brewing material for a new album which is slated for release in mid 2010. The new project features MCs KonSCI and Tronic delivering their unique perspectives over the productions of some heavy hitters. KevBrown, oddisee, iLLmind, J.Rawls, KonSCI of MindsOne and Jamoculus were enlisted to provide a new edge to the MindsOne sound. Anticipation is high...
