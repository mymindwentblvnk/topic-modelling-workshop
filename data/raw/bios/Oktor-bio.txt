The idea of Oktor was born a long time ago, but at this time Jerzy and Jan had a lot of work with their main band (April Ethereal). The idea was here, but there was no time to make this idea live. Until the middle of 2003. From this time the idea of Oktor became clearer, first riffs and drum tracks were recorded. At the beginnig of 2004, after some time spent on discussions, Jan and Jerzy invited Piotr, their friend and also the bass player from Eternal Tear (doom/death metal band from Warsaw), to join this project.

From the beginning we wanted to play a very slow, painful and sad kind of doom metal. We didn't want to found another band that will simply play doom, we wanted to create music with people who share with us the same point of view on emotional music. Oktor is for us more than a simple pleasure of creating music.

In 2004 the band records and releases through Foreshadow Productions their debut EP called simply Oktor "EP". The feedback being really positive, some months later Oktor records a new song called "All Gone in Moments" which is published on the "Foresee the Shadows volume 1" compilation released, again, by Foreshadow Productions.

Oktor is also invited by Foreshadow to participate in a split album with the french doom metal band Monolithe, but before the release date Monolithe change their minds and decide to release their song on another record label. Oktor, having almost finished the recording of their song, decide to include it on a future release.

In the meantime the first "EP" is sold out and, as Foreshadow is interested in re-releasing it, the band decides to release those two songs again as a part of a split album with Quercus and The River. The band also starts to work (although very slowly) on a full length. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oktor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
