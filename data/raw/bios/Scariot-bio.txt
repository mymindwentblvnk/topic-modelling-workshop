Scariot is a metal band from Kristiansand, Norway. The band was started by Daniel Olaisen  (Blood Red Throne, Cobolt 60) in 1997. He was at that time the live guitarist for Norwegian black metal legends Satyricon, but wanted his very own band.

Scariot is a mixed bag of metal styles. Their first album, Deathforlorn, combined prog-metal clean vocals with low, clear death metal growls. Their 2nd album dropped the clean vocals for the most part, while their third, Strange to Numbers dropped most of the growling. The second album, Toungeless God was never officially released, the band however, published 300 copies independently. Their fourth album, Momentum Shift, was released in February 2007.

There has been a lot of different members in the band, and the only one still remaining from the start of the band is Daniel Olaisen. Because of this the band's style has changed a lot from album to album. At the moment the band is considered to be a studio band, because all the members are involved in different bands as well. Today the style of the band can be described as progressive power metal, and are often compared to Nevermore.
