The process of composition started inmedialtly, and soon a concept for the music of SOLARSTORM become clearer. Due to the several and diverse influences, the musical genre were called BLASTER POWER METAL, a genre that fussion Euro Power Metal, with Melodic Death Metal and Progressive elements. 

Later, Bass player Alex García joins the band in June of 2003. In November of the same year, Angel (Vocals) and Mauricio Rúa (Guitars) joined the band completing the line-up for SOLARSTORM. 

The lyrical concept was decided to be related to the name of the band, together with the visual and estetic content. This concept was determined to be a sci-fi/post apocalyptic store that talks about the total destruction of the planet Earth in the hands of a Solar cataclysm. This was made with the purpose of giving continuity and dynamism to the songs, albums and graphic arts developed for the band. 

The band has played in local shows and fests in front of several audiences receiving a great response from public and critics. 

Nowadays, SOLARSTORM is in the process of Pre-Production of what will be its debut album called Bursting the Earth.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SOLARSTORM">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
