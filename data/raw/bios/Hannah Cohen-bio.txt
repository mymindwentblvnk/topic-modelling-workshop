Hannah Cohen (born October 25, 1986), is an American singer and model. 

V Magazine and Vogue photographer Matthu Placek made the video for her debut single, “Child Bride.” Based in New York, Cohen was first encouraged to pick up a guitar after falling in with a group of the city’s most-anointed musicians, including Grammy-award-winner Jesse Harris and cabaret artist Justin Bond. “For the past five years I have been mostly listening to Brazilian vinyl from the 60s and 70s,” the sultry artist says of her inspirations. “The classics like Caetano Veloso — his record Jóia is an absolute favorite of mine.” Cohen’s folk-infused songs and striking looks soon caught the attention of Antony and the Johnsons collaborator Thomas Bartlett; the pair worked together on Cohen’s first album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hannah+Cohen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
