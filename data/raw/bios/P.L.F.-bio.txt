Pretty Little Flower, or Pulverizing Lethal Force, or P.L.F., is a grindcore band based out of Houston, USA. They formed in 1999. Their name started out as a facetious suggestion from current guitarist and vocalist Dave Callier, who at the time of the suggestion was not a member of the band. Lyrics in their early music were based on socio-political concerns. P.L.F. tours regularly in Europe and the United States. Their music has been called "the illegitimate marriage of grindcore and thrash metal and probably the fury resulting from the late knowledge of that fact." Free Press Houston said of P.L.F.: "For those that buy into the idea that Rock and Roll has lost its grit, P.L.F. and the Gulf Coast hardcore scene should renew your faith." Marshall Sehmann is the bassist and Bryan Fajardo is the drummer as of 2011 September. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/P.L.F.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
