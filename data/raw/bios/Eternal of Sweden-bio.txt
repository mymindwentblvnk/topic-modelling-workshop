The members of Eternal began to play melodic hardrock in the early 80s. Some of them together and some of them in other bands. In the 90s they did some recording projects together and also played together in some coverbands.
After a lot of years in coverbands they got tired of that, and decided to play and make their own style of hardrock again. In the spring of 2007 they got together to start up their new band Eternal.
