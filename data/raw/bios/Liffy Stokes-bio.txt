Liffy Stokes is rapper based in Westside, Illinois, USA. He is a frequent collaborator with Twista and a member of the rap group Speedknot Mobstaz. He and Twista had a falling out with Maze of the Mobstaz, resulting in a temporary impasse between them. However, that is apparently now out of the way and things are kosher among all three. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Liffy+Stokes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
