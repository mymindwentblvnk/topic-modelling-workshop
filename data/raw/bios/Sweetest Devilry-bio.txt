Jean-François Béguigné and Andrian Béguigné (guitarist and singer - drummer) both decided at the end of 2011 to start to step higher this band. In the beginning It was really difficult for the band to find their musicians . So they decided to stop the auditions for a moment and to go to the " Sound suite studio from Marseille (France) and to recording some material with Terje refnes a man who worked with some international bands like INGENTING (Norway, with aproximately 300 000 albums sold out), CARPATHIAN FOREST (Norway), GORGOROTH (Norway) BATTLELORE (Finland), TURISAS (Finland) , ENSLAVED ( Norway ) , TRISTANIA ( Norway ) , SIRENIA ( Norway ) ...
