Splintered Soul formed in 2006 was founded by Chris Frost, when he and his colleagues in a music shop wanted to start a band. Originally wanted to write Neo-Classical infused Metal, it ended up becoming Progressive/Symphonic Metal when Chris' musical background in writing for Film, TV and Computer Games influenced the music. On the first day the band was formed, Chris composed "Backhander", a quirky yet happy sounding piece of music with dark lyrics, which got scrapped a year later as being too commercial sounding. On day 2, Chris wrote "Haunted" which is still one of the most popular Splintered Soul tracks to date. Since then, Chris had been knocking out around a new tune every month, which he always gives a Prototype name to until a real name emerges (i.e. Backhander was Proto 1, Haunted was Proto 2 etc.,) We're already up to Proto 30, which can only mean that this band will always have new material for the fans!

Two years on, and line up change, Splintered Soul are only going from strength to strength, gaining global popularity and reaching number 1 in the Reverbnation Metal Charts. Splintered Soul still don't have a singer, yet somehow it doesn't seem to affect the fans around the world. Splintered Soul have pioneered Film Score Metal (aka MetalScore).

Chris Frost is also a student of the legendary Chris Broderick, Guitarist of Megadeth.
