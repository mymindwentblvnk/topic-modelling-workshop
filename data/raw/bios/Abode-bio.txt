There is one band and a separate singer/songwriter named Abode:

1) Abode formed in Bergen, Norway in September 2010.

In January 2011 the band hit the studio for the first time to record a bunch of demo tracks, and then started to play gigs regularly in the Bergen area at legendary club venues such as Kvarteret, Hulen and Garage. The band has also played at John Dee in Oslo, Folken in Stavanger, Ladehammerfestivalen in Trondheim and Fjellparkfestivalen in Flekkefjord.

2) abode from canada, began releasing music in 1999.

I like writing and recording music - although i haven't had much of a chance lately there are plans in the works, for more stuff. I guess you could call the music hush folk, mostly acoustic but with a few overdubs, over the years i have about 50 songs available. You can hear the broken fragments here and at soundclick.... thanks again for checking it out. any missing songs from here can likely be found at www.soundclick.com/abode  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/abode">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
