we are a family band. we play on porches, in barns, around bonfires, and sometimes in the city. we write and record most of our songs at our cabin in the catskills. after recording an ep in the fall of 2008, we are now in the midst of mixing our first full length. stay updated with the progress here.

family band is kim krans and jonny ollsin, with scott hirsch on bass and lapsteel, and luke fasano on drums. we are based in nyc but our tunes are not. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Family+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
