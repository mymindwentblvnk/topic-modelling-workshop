K Woe has been playing different kinds of guitarplaying through some years now which leaves us pretty free to how we want a certain riff to sound like, as he definitely has the mind and skills for what is needed in Woebegone Obscured. No happy sounds here!!!!!!! D Woe broke up old black metal band Rimfrost in 2003 after ten years of getting nowhere where we wanted. Woebegone Obscured was thus created for releasing our inner thoughts of black holes, dark nature, occultism, melancholy and suicide solutions. Inspiration came suddenly, when D Woe was commended to a mental asylum. Loathing in depression and suicide thoughts, the lyrical seed was planted solid. Musicwise, a much, much slower approach was considered, and suited what we were looking for, perfectly. We wanted ugly, yet interesting metal without being held back from the norms. No keyboards, female chanting or hyperspeed blasting!! Just slow Funeral doom fueled by atmosphere, occultism and individual performances. ( K Woe also plays guitar in a black metal "no name"band yet with members from Black Dementia and Horned Almighty, but is still continuing with the woebegone). ( D Woe also playes drums in brutal gore Death metal act, Skinned Beyond Recognition). -More to follow-666- <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Woebegone+Obscured">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
