In late 2002, three fuccking gore-death maniacs decided to start a legacy about much carnage, once comes along every sickness related a bed of a hospital. Then a stench of a spill from defecating ass six feet bellow was once and for all exhaled. In that time the band had rot intentions, so it brought disgusting tales of horrid themes, as examples, diseases troubles and medical mistakes. Ass Flavour sounds like death-cult gory metal, meanwhile as fuck as old Carcass. The current members have been playing with quite enthusiasm, simultaneously concert after concert when they spread the flagrancy for the first time. Consequently it had to change, but by the ime itself. Gustavo guitars was requested and gave more consistency to the songs, with a step closer to their style definition. That’s why “Hernya Hurts” Demo would ever be possible. Later the band has been in a search a new drummer, because Augusto went to leave. Now more than ever, it’s closer bands of the genre such as: Aborted, Impaled, Anal Blast, Severe Torture, Hemorrhage, Criptopsy, etc… Now a new drummer was joined and completed the four, Victor Boechat, executing the most brutal form of agression on the black death scene on this gore splatter assault. In early 2008 integrates the band Andre Fisher(Exylium), adding another guitar to the band, closing the line-up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ass+Flavour">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
