What young stand up comedienne was able to marry John Travolta in the feature film "Lucky Numbers," got to make out with John Cryer on the ABC series "The Trouble with Normal" and teach Jenna Elfman how to play the violin on the hit series "Dharma and Greg?" Maria Bamford. Maria is a Duluth, Minnesota native who left Minnesota for Hollywood.

Maria started her stand up career performing at comedy clubs in Minneapolis. Maria made a stop on her way to Hollywood at the HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado. Her unique character based, edgy stand-up excited Hollywood television and film executives at the festival and led to a number of memorable roles.

Maria has performed her stand up comedy three times on NBC's hit late night talk show "The Conan O'Brien Show." She has also appeared on Comedy Central's "Premium Blend," "Make Me Laugh," and "John Oliver's New York Stand Up Show," as well as Louie Anderson's NBS series "Comedy Showcase."

Maria's talent is not limited to television and film. She is a series regular on the animated Nickelodeon series "CatDog."

On a more personal note, Maria can't wait to settle down and get married and or be surrounded in warm, rising bread dough! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maria+Bamford">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
