Nekro-Torso plays humoristic grindcore in the veins of old Napalm Death and Xysma etc.

Formed in 1991 and released officially 3 demo tapes in -91, -92 and -93 and split up after the final tape in -93. "Torso Grindcore 91-93" compilation released in 2006 and contains all those 3 demo tapes + bonus stuff.
