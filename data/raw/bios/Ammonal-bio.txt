Ammonal is an Italian Melodic Death Metal band, founded in 2008 by Renzo and Leo, respectively the bass player and the guitarist of the Melodic Death Metal band EarthFlame. After a while the guitarist Andrea joined them and together they started to work at the new project. After some months and some line up changes, Leo became also the singer of the band and in February 2009 the keyboarder Federico joined the line up. By now ready for the recording of the first demo, Ammonal is still looking for a right drummer for the project and is still composing new songs, as ever inspired by Melodic Death, but not shut up by traditional standards of the genre. 

In October 2009, after a long search, the drummer Moreno finally joins the band and in April 2010 Ammonal records the first demo:“Beginning the End of Everything”.The band has just signed for Revalve Records and it's now preparing the new official album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ammonal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
