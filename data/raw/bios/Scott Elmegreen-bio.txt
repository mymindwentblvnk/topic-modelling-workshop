Biography

Scott Elmegreen comes from a family of astrophysicists and climatologists, so of course he is an artist (it's pretty much the same thing, right?).

As a composer, Scott's work has premiered on Broadway, off-Broadway, nationally, and internationally, and as a writer, Scott is the author of numerous novels, musicals, and plays. Some science-y favorites include Awesome Allie First Kid Astronaut (see? That's sort of like astrophysics), and the 25th anniversary Magic School Bus musical, The Magic School Bus, Live! The Climate Challenge (and that's basically climatology - except that in musicals, the math doesn't need to work out).

Writing for PhD Comics

Scott is also the author of COLLEGE The Musical, and was originally contacted (thanks to producer Meg Rosenburg) to write and compose the final scene in The PHD Movie, in which all the characters broke out into song.

Sadly, or perhaps thankfully, this scene was cut due to production constraints. But that doesn't mean there weren't still plenty of good opportunities for background music! Scott happily composed additional scoring for the film, including the Chachacha and Rumba of the ballroom scene, along with other transitions and cues throughout. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scott+Elmegreen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
