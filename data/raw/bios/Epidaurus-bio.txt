Epidaurus was a German symphonic rock band of the 70s. They released an album called Earthly Paradise in 1977, featuring a sound dominated by keyboards, particularly Mellotron. The original LP has become a collectors' item fetching high prices. A second release, Endangered, came out in 1994, with some 70s material redone, as well as some new material done in a more modern style. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Epidaurus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
