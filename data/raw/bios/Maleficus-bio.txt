Maleficus is a black metal band from Guatemala, created at the end of 2006. It was originally formed by Armisael, the bassist, and Dargomnos, the guitarist, and they both started to look for the third member of the band.

After going through different candidates, disappointments and else, finally the current drummer, aka Abraxas now, was contacted and showed an unusual interest for the music played.

The band took a very interesting sound, because all three members have different influences, and some in common, creating a Black Metal with their own style.

After their debut on April the 13th 2007 with Aphylon and SenderoS, Maleficus is thinking of being part of more gigs and bringing out the true Guatemalan metal.. which has been kept in the shadows for way too long.

On May 2007 the recording of the demo begins with Aphylon and Agatha, and is expected to be finished soon.

Current Line up:

Dargomnos: Guitar / Voice
Abraxas: Battery
Armisael: Bass / Voice <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maleficus">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
