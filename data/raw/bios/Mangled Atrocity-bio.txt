Mangled Atrocity is a Brutal death metal band from USA. They formed in 2003 by Keith Robinson (guitars), Jack Douglas (Vocals) and Troy Toggle (bass).

They released a split in 2004 with Artery Eruption which was considered their best effort so far out of all their demos (from 2003 and early 2004). This was going to lead with them having a debut album in 2005, however, becuase of the personnal issues of the band members they delayed the band's debut until 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mangled+Atrocity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
