1) Old school hardcore band from Plovdiv, Bulgaria.

2) We're 5 guys, playing metalcore, headbanging, moshing, working, eating, sleeping,drinking, fucking, ducking, trucking, packing, whatever ing... just listen! :-*

3) Wilkes-Barre hardcore

4) Nothing Left burn down the house with their gritty, two fisted approach to hardcore. Raw and angry, this 6-song EP refuels the flames of the early hardcore movement and makes you remember the dynamic underground music scene of your youth. “Destroy and Rebuild” is satisfyingly stripped down, with an in-your-face aggression—exactly what you’d hope for in a passion project from brothers Brandon and Ryan Leitru, formerly of For Today. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nothing+Left">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
