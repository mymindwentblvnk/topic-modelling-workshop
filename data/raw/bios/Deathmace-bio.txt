Formed in Manchester, UK (now based in York, UK), DEATHMACE has been playing a neck-snappingly violent, toe-tappingly catchy brand of old-school death/thrash in the vein of REPULSION, SADUS and DISMEMBER since 2009. Three demos - 'Cruel Obsessions' (2010), 'Pungent Practices' (2011) and 'Sordid Sessions' (2012) - have been recorded so far and are available at http://deathmace.bandcamp.com/ to download for FREE.
