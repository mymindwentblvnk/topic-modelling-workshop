CLAYSKIN is a rock/metal band from Finland. The very first idea of the band was in summer 2000 when Kalle and Sami thought it would be nice for a change to play something different than cover songs. The original idea was to find right people in a right state of mind who could actually get along and write good music. During the years the band has gone through some lineup changes...

2008 - Current Clayskin Lineup:

Sami Koskinen - vocals
Jami Takala - guitar
Tuomas Tarkka - guitar
Eerik Rantapere - bass
Kalle Saarinen - drums
