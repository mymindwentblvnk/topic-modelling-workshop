Straight outta Smutville, these 3 rappers have already established a fearsome reputation in sydney by supporting the nation's finest as well as international acts. Also, sparking interest while travelling interstate for shows. The crew has been involved in local hiphop since the late nineties, Overproof core members are:

FAME: (Producer/vocals)

ABUSE: (vocals)

SWARMY: (vocals)

2003 saw the crew officially band together, with Fame directing the sounds and later joining the others on the mic. The focus from the start was always to differentiate themselves from others. Their streetwise attitude is always evident, but they are far from restricted to a battle rap focus. Overproof's ability to develop a story or thoroughly explore a concept through rhyme is undoubtadly their strength.

Now, combined with the force of Brokentooth Entertainment, they are finally ready to unleash their debut LP "The High Life". Brace for Takeover.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Overproof">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
