Bleed Again was first conceived in 2006 by Jamie Dawson, David Hayler & Simon Williams & were called Reborn. Gary Wheeler later joined helping them out with Bass. After losing their original drummer Russell Plowman joined the band to fill in. They gigged around Brighton before taking time out to record a self produced album in July '08 & also decided to have a change of name; Bleed Again were born. They then went on to win a local battle of the bands & got into the local metal scene in Brighton. Bleed again have released there debut album GODS OF WAR and are already writting a new EP to follow the release of the album with the best material they have ever written. Bleed Again are a blend of all the bands that have influnced them.
