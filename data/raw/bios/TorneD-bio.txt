TorneD is a power metal band from Finland founded in Kirkkonummi somewhere around 2004. First few years were pretty much just playing covers and fooling around, trying to find the right people to play with. The band has since revolved around Tuomas, Aki and Heikki. They played a few gigs during the early years, with some of their own stuff and a few covers. It was after 2005, after their last gig and last misfortunate line-up changes, that the group somehow gave up and fell into oblivion. 

It wasn’t until spring of 2009 and the arrival of Markku Kuikka (Status Minor, Thaurorod), that took things to another direction. They had made a few new songs and were in the process of recording a demo to find a singer, when Kuikka noticed the songs on a web page. It didn’t take long for him to do the vocal lines for the tracks, and, respectively, it didn’t take long for the band to head to the studio to finally record a demo. The whole project turned out to be quite a long road to travel.

Since it seemed to take a bit longer than they expected, TorneD recorder a few more new songs. Now, along with a new bass player, fresh demo, new songs to record and play live, they finally found themselves in the position they left a few years back.
