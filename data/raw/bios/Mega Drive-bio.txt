Mega Drive is an American synthwave artist from Dallas, Texas.

“For an 80s synth artist to surface calling himself Mega Drive brings with it an air of excitement and it’s a mantle a weak or lesser artist would be mistaken to use. This gentleman, though, is well worthy of this moniker. His music is action packed with killer set pieces, driving pace, untold drama and swells with emotion.” – Synthetix <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mega+Drive">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
