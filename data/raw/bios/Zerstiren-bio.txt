Zerstiren started back in August 2007 as a side project for Shamus (Guitar - Without Constraint) and Chris (Bass - Dagon), kicked off with the recording of two demos, Chris switching to guitar. This intensely technical and powerful base was built on with the lyrical musings of Fred Bain, Tim Kings' tortured blasting, and Sheigno Blacks' monolithic bass playing (and unique take on the universe...)

After consolidating the initial lineup and some very intensive months of practise, expectations started to rise in the Christchurch metal scene that Zerstiren, with its already experienced and well-known musicians, would take the metal community by storm... and thus they did. With three out of town gigs and a monster debut Christchurch gig in short succession, Zerstiren quickly pushed themselves to the forefront of the scene.

However, line up problems stopped any capitalisation on initial success, and aside from a few one off gigs with prodigious new bass player Brad Kneale (Bass - Aphelon), Zerstiren was forced into hibernation.

But all is not lost. The past few months have seen the recruitment of Mikey Harland on samples and general foolery, as well as the birth of some truly devastating new music. The old setlist has been scrapped and the new sound is infinitely more mature, technical and progressive, born through a more focussed and measured writing process and a better working atmosphere.

And finally, after fruitless months of searching for a new drummer worthy of the position, Tim has rejoined the crew. The lineup is complete and the metamorphosis is underway. Our debut album is advancing towards completion and live gigs are on the horizon. Stay tuned, the Eschaton is nigh...
