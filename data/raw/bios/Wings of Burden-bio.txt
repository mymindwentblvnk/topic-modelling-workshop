Wings of Burden was a metal band from Richmond, VA consisting of vocalist Mitch Hughes, guitarists David Spradlin and Jonathan Tangard, and drummer Wilson Cox. Friend Kevin Downey contributed bass duties toward the end of the band. The band was short-lived, starting around November 2006 and ending in November 2007. In their short time together they primarily focused on writing and eventually recorded a five song demo. They only played one live show together.

Wings of Burden explored different subgenres of metal in their songs and tried not to be pidgeon-holed in the same metalcore classification as some of their Richmond counterparts. Some songs show traditional structure while others display more progressive elements. The members primarily drew influence from both Scandinavian and American death metal styles.

Wilson Cox went on to play drums in the now defunct Enemy at the Six. Jonathan Tangard is now involved in a solo black metal project named The Red Horse of War. David Spradlin still writes music with Wilson Cox and plans on it materializing into a progressive/post metal band in the near future. Mitch Hughes now competes as a Mixed Martial Arts fighter in the Richmond area. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wings+of+Burden">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
