a much loved but now sorely missed, one off, northwest/midlands hybrid of instinctive salfordian folkies and classicaly trained, satirical, psychedelic enthusiasts. did 2 albums on manchesters finest and most influential independant label, twisted nerve. their debut, 'if you happy with you need do nothing' was a sketchy, low-fi, but charming collection of 3 early e.p's that was then followed up with their twisted nerve debut proper, 'a word in your ear'. this record saw the band move a leap closer to the string and harmony drenched, sunshine psychedelia they were planning for their 3rd album, their debut record on regal/parlophone, 'do you imagine things?'. none of these albums sold particulary well so the band did their best and put together their 4th long player, 'crying at teatime'. this record was much bolder but still bore their, by now familiar, lacadaisical, unpretentious, soothing, yada, yada, yada sound, soooo.... as this was supposed to be their debut into the pop world everybody decided that it was all much too odd, all round, so they did the decent thing, (rather than bending to the celebrity ruled world of a.o.r.) and split up.

Alfie may also refer to the artist named Alfie Silas, known for her work with The Andra√© Crouch Choir, and solo work under misc names, notably "Star" which was included on The Last Dragon Movie Soundtrack.

2) Alfie aka Alf-Gunnar Nielsen is a Norwegian pop singer who took part in the Norwegian national final of the 2003 Eurovision Song Contest with a song called "One". He was one of the members of Cape - a band formed in a Norwegian talent show Popstars on TV3.
