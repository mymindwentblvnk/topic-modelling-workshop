Trick of Light split up a couple of years ago, so it is a bit hard to write a biography.
They define their music as "Rock'N'Metal"  ... but it got a lot of extensive influences.

Here is what they published with their last album:

They know the meaning of sophistication as well as their instruments. Don't expect them to play traditional... Even the past comes around for a few minutes, dancing the debut's "Shotgun Tango" again. Try this "Alone", between "Dusk And Dawn", when things happen, that change: Emotions and machine-like precision. Be different but catchy - Trick Of Light can. "You Could Have Tried" - T.O.L. did. Like debut's "Neuromancer" or "Gold" T.O.L.'s new songs are fed with alien inspiration without being a typical intellect-progressive metal-album. It's rock music at its best: Composed by inspiration and recorded by passion. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trick+of+Light">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
