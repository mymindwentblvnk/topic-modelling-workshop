Dark Sensation, formed in 2002 by Christophe Sturbois and Jonas Sanders, is well-known for delivering their energetic thrash/death-metal upon the metalscene. Brining their music straight to the point like Pantera did, fans of Hatesphere, The Haunted and Pro-pain will know what to expect. After years of concerts and prestigious contests the band found its stable line-up in 2008.

After the release of their EP "Fall of Duty", praised by many reviews, the band continued working even harder and was making ready to deliver new devastating songs. It wasn't long before they brought us their debut album "Trendkill". 12 kickass songs recorded at Hermit's Studio and mixed and mastered by almighty Jacob Bredahl at Smart'n'Hard Productions. This gave the band the opportunity to play with bands as Stuck Mojo, All Shall Perish, Skinless, Vader, Ektomorf, Job For A Cowboy, Eths, Deviate, l'esprit du clan, Leng Tch'e, In-Quest, Sepultura, Sworn enemy, Cro-mags, Kataklysm, Behemoth... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Sensation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
