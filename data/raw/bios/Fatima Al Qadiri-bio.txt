فاطمة القديري (Romanization: Fatima Al Qadiri) is a Brooklyn-based composer, musician, curator and artist. Born in Senegal, Al Qadiri's exposure to the rampant misappropriation of Western subculture while growing up in Kuwait is apparent in her highly virtuosic body of work. She has performed her symphonic and plaintive baroque electronic compositions at The Kitchen, Gallery 179 and Santos Party House and has regularly exhibited multimedia projects in New York City and Kuwait alongside fellow iconoclasts Khalid Al Gharaballi and Lauren Boyle. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fatima+Al+Qadiri">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
