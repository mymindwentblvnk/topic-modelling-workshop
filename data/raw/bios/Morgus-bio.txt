Morgus the Magnificent, also known as Momus Alexander Morgus, is a fictional character created and portrayed by actor Sidney Noel Rideau (aka Sid Noel). From the late 1950s into the 1980s Morgus was a "horror host" of late-night science fiction and horror movies and television shows that originated in the New Orleans, Louisiana market. Morgus is a quintessential mad scientist, assisted by executioner-styled sidekick, Chopsley (Tommy George). Morgus' well-intentioned experiments often served as book-end pieces to the late-night films being shown, and typically went awry at the last minute. 

In 1959, Mississippi-based Vin Records released a 7-inch single entitled "Morgus The Magnificent" by Frankie Ford and Mac Rebennack performing as "Morgus and The Ghouls" (aka "Morgus & The 3 Ghouls"). The record made the local New Orleans radio top ten record chart. In that same year, Morgus recorded the single "Werewolf", this time with The Daringers.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morgus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
