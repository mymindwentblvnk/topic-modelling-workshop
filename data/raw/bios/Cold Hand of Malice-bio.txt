Cold Hand of Malice is a Progressive Thrash band formed in Cairns, Queensland, Australia in 2009. They have released 1 EP titled "For the Cause of Ruin", launched on the 23rd of October 2009.

Following the demise of their former band, Guitarist/Vocalist David "Davo" Richards and Drummer Andrew Ward met with Guitarist Michael "Maccas" Davidson. Following an instrument swap which saw Andrew join David on Guitar/Vocals and saw Michael switch to drums, the band recruited Ben "Benji" Fisher on bass to complete the lineup of Cold Hand of Malice. The band would soon find themselves playing with well known bands from all across Queensland, such as Brisbane's The Amity Affliction and Wish for Wings, Cairns' Canniblast and Townsville's (now disbanded) Born a Giant, and from this achieved praise from fans for their distinctly heavy but melodic sound. Starting in July, the band began recording on their EP. Following this in August 2009, the band embarked on the "Far Northern Assault Tour", the band's first reasonably sized tour which saw them setting foot in Townsville and Mackay, aswell as their local Cairns.

After a few more months of playing shows in Cairns and Townsville, Cold Hand of Malice's EP "For The Cause of Ruin" was released on the 23rd of October, 2009. 

The band has plans for more touring during December 2009 - February 2010.
