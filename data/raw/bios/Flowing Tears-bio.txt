Flowing Tears was a gothic metal band from Saarland, Germany. Formed in 1994, their original band name was Flowing Tears & Withered Flowers, which they used on their first two releases, Swansongs and Joy Parade. On Swansongs, Manfred Bersin contributed the male vocals. They officially split up in 2014.

With the release of Serpentine two years later, the band would build on the work they did with Jade, adding a slightly more up tempo, less depressing sound. After the release of Serpentine, Stefanie Duchêne had to leave the band. Her pregnancy was incompatible with the high sights of the band. She is currently working on her solo career. Their current vocalist is Helen Vogt. With a sound similar to that of Serpentine, and Vogt's vocal similarities with Stefanie Duchêne's vocals, the band released their 5th studio album, Razorbliss.

On October 20, 2004, just seven months after the release of "Razorbliss", two founding members of Flowing Tears, Björn Lorson and Cristian Zimmer, died in a car accident.

Exactly 4 years after the accident, on October 20, 2008 they released their sixth studio album, titled Thy Kingdom Gone. It is a concept album containing 12 songs, along with artwork made by Seth Siro Anton, who is known for doing artwork with Moonspell, Soilwork, and Paradise Lost.
