Nemesea is a female fronted rock band founded by ex-vocalist Manda Ophuis and guitarist HJ in September 2002 in Groningen, The Netherlands. The band currently consists of Sanne Mieloo (vocals), HJ (guitars), Sonny Onderwater (bass), Lasse Delbrugge (keyboards) and Frank van der Star (drums).

In April 2003 the band had their first performance as support act for After Forever, and remained that band's support for a year. They attracted record company interest and signed for small Dutch label Ebony Tears in November 2003. In November 2004 Nemesea released their debut album "Mana" (meaning 'the magical power of things, given by the gods'), and they later toured the Netherlands and Belgium until December 2005. By this time they were well established in the Nordic European symphonic metal scene. For their second album, Nemesea had talks with some major record labels, but they later decided to sign up to the Dutch crowdsourcing website SellaBand. They were the first band to raise more than $50,000 from the fans, and the album, called "In Control", was released on June 21, 2007. A distribution deal was made with Rough Trade Records to bring the new album to music stores in Benelux on October 26, 2007.

Nemesea released their 3rd studio album through Napalm records called The Quiet Resistance on 18-11-2011
Nemesea also released a remixed and remastered version of their live album Pure live@P3.



Nemesea added Lasse Delbrugge (ex-Orphanage) to their lineup as keyboard player in 2009.
