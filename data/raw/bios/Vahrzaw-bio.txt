Blackened Death Metal band from Traralgon, Victoria. First formed in 1992 as Necromancy, before changing their name to Midgard. The band released one self-titled demo before changing their name again in 1994 to Utgard-Loki, and then finally, Vahrzaw.

Vahrzaw disbanded in 1998, before reforming in 2005. Their reunion saw the shift in musical style from their black metal roots, evolving into a blackened death metal sound.
