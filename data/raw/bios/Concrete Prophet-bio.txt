Concrete Prophet spawned from the desire to blend progressive metal with a modern perspective. “We make stripped-down progressive metal,” says Mike. “We balance musical literacy with widespread appeal.”


Though their image, like their music, differs from a typical ‘heavy band,’ a live show contains what you’d expect from influences like Iron Maiden and Dream Theater: tight performances enhanced by a charismatic frontman and a jolt of energy from start to finish.


While currently promoting their debut EP, Concrete Prophet still finds time to connect with new fans. “We make a large effort to alert the online community about what we have to offer," adds Michael. "Our passion is exposing people to good, melodic, heavy rock.”


Inspiration comes from the fact that most people are unaware the intensity of progressive music can be enjoyed by the casual listener. “We aim to blend the two,” says Kevin. Despite the array of musical experience, compared to their goal, they’re just getting started. “Our purpose involves creating something bigger than the four of us,” Brian muses. “To develop an entity that has a life of it's own.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Concrete+Prophet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
