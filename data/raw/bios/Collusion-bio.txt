There are four artists named Collusion.

One Collusion was started in the summer of 2006 by Xander Snyder, who wanted to do something that had never been done in the Los Angeles metal and rock scenes. So, he got some old friends and some new ones (Mike on bass and the new drummer Emin) together who shared his vision for this new sound. The band's earlier songs are mainly influenced by the European metal music and the attitude of the American rock and progressive bands with the technicality of both worlds.

Another Collusion is a trance-project, with four members: Marco V, Benjamin Bates, Boy van Lamoen and Tom van der Heijden. For their releases, check http://www.discogs.com/artist/Collusion.

The third band is the Collusion discovered by Max A Million in 2000 which he heard about through word of mouth by numerous individuals. He then invited Collusion to his location in Riverdale, IL. Collusion launched his own record label Collusionary Minds Entertainment. Check his music and bio out at http://www.myspace.com/collusionaryminds

Last but not least, Collusion is a band from Malaysia. They was formed somewhere in 2011 from the ashes of a screamo band, heavily influenced by La Quiete, called Dramacoma. The genre initially agreed upon in the formation of Collusion was the 'heavy-straight-in-your-face-screamo' from the likes of United Nations and Loma Prieta. But hints of odd counting and weird tempos were then added in the composition of songs. Collusion has yet to be constrained by any genres. Go check them overthere -
