"...and the Fatal Flying Guilloteens? Well, Chunklet's had a big ol' boner for those Houstonians for years now. Their new album is due in the late spring on Frenchkiss Records and is a kinetic interpretation of The Jesus Lizard discography crammed thru a kaleidoscope of dark 90's spazz rockers like the VSS. And again, their live shows are quite galvanizing and have only improved in all the times I've seen them. And hell, Tim Kerr adores them! That should be enough for anybody."

-Henry Owings. Chunklet Magazine.

"Disjointed blues riffs wrap themselves neatly around foot-tapping (yet anarchic) drum beats, with the screaming of our pubescent superstar layered on top, combined to form an Extra Value Meal of blues-punks-who-used-to-like-indie-rock-but-got-bored-with-it-by-grade-ten. Hands down the best thing to emerge from Estrus since the Drags. 9 out of 10." 

-Vice Magazine

"The Fatal Flying Guiloteens bring a classic SST/early-Touch and Go sound to the inexplicably un-crowded modern punk table." 

-Vertical Slum
