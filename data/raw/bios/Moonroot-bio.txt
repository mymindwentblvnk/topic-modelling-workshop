MOONROOT is the collective artistic vision of twin brothers, Mark and Michael Riddick, and Dawn Desireé. All three artists have a widespread background in various forms of musical expression, ranging from the ancient to the contemporary. Their experience includes publication in the heavy metal, neo-folk, medieval, electronic, and ambient genres. The music of Moonroot is inspired by the beauty of experience and is interpreted metaphorically through themes of the fantastic and arcane.

MOONROOT combines influences from Celtic folk music, medieval music, atmospheric metal, progressive rock, and 1960's and 70's psychedelic music. Since it's formation in 1997, MOONROOT have generated several rehearsal demos and are presently recording their debut CD/LP for Italy's progressive label Black Widow Records.
