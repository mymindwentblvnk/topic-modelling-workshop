There are multiple artists named Luke Abbott:

1) English electronic musician.
2) American roots musician.

1) Electronic: Norfolk's Luke Abbott was one of the many special artists set adrift after the unfortunate demise of the legendary Output Recordings, and nowadays they gladly welcomed him into the Border Community family for the release of his musically ambitious Tuesday EP. Luke is no stranger to the live circuit, and has recently modified his more experimental live stylings to create a new club-friendly set of dance music in the loosest possible sense to help us drag dancefloors everywhere into the 21st century.

2) Acoustic: Luke Abbott (born 1986) is a Santa Cruz-based musician, music teacher, and member of the music-inspired Abbott family. He first heard bluegrass music in 1997 and soon learned to play all the bluegrass instruments: banjo, fiddle, guitar, mandolin, Dobro, and bass. In 2008 he began exploring solo performance of Appalachian mountain music, which in June 2010 coalesced into an album, entitled Take Me Home.
