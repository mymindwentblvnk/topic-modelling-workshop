Bludvera are a five piece New School Thrash Metal band from Liverpool, England. They were founded in winter 2008. Combining great inspiration from the ‘Bay Area’ and Teutonic Thrash movements, fast-paced shredding guitars and powerful vocals comparable to those of Thrash legends Kreator and Slayer, Bludvera have set out for domination over the UK Metal scene - aiming to restore its former glory and claim their place in the history of Thrash Metal.

In 2010 they released their first ever self-titled demo which is available to download free from their myspace.

2012, marked the release of their EP, Terrorform.
