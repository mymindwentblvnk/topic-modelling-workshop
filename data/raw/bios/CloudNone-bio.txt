In an era when electronic dance music controls the radio waves, CloudNone is providing an inspiring reminder of the genre’s humble origins. And though the name implies the opposite of the term “cloud nine”, CloudNone has harnessed a unique ability to create uplifting melodies that immediately elevate the listener into another world.

After pouring out a steady barrage of ethereal soundscapes since his initial release in September of 2018, CloudNone has firmly cemented himself amongst the Monstercat Instinct artist roster.

His releases have quickly gathered millions of plays, bringing in support from the likes of Tiesto, Illenium, Mr. Suicide Sheep and even scored him an exclusive release with the famed video game, Rocket League.

Closing out 2019 in style, the year was marked with a broadening of horizons as CloudNone released a lofi collaboration with Slushii, further legitimizing himself as an influencer on the greater electronic music scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/CloudNone">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
