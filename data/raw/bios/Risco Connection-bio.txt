Producer Joe Isaacs put together Risco Connection in the late 1970's. The group covered many classic Disco tracks their own way. Their biggest hit "Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now", was a cover of McFadden & Whitehead's title. "I'm Caught Up (In A One Night Love Affair)" was a cover of a song by Inner Life (originally sung by Jocelyn Brown). "Good Times" was a cover of Chic's super hit, while "It's My House" was originally performed by Diana Ross. 
Vocalists Otis Gayle and Lorna Brooks were part of the group.
