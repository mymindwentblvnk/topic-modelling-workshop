Spawned from the ashes of Denver Colorado grindcore and brutal death metal bands Dismembered Fetus, Adnauseam, Festerin Puke, Misunderstood and Yeast Infection, Zombie Hate Briade started their march of destruction in late December of 2003.  They released their own self titled CD early in 2008 in the United States under Get Up and Kill Records with European distribution through Apathetic View.  With a true love of horror movies, Zombie Hate Brigade bases their lyrics on some of the greatest cult classics like the Toxic Avenger, Night of the Living Dead, Phantasm, Body Melt, Buio Omega, the late great Vincent Price plus much, much more.   The band can be found on myspace by searching for Zombie Hate Brigade.  The band just finished up making their first video for the song 'I wanna put my junk in Stacy' and can be found on youtube. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zombie+Hate+Brigade">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
