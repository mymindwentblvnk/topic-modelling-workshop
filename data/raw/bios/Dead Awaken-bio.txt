Dead Awaken started out in the spring of 2002. The members were: Andreas "Adde" Backström - guitar, Joakim Edlund - Drums, Jonas Lindberg - guitar Andreas "Fluff" Morén - vocals. The band was missing a bass player, but those army boots were soon filled by former ABHOTH guitarist/vocalist Jörgen Kristensen. Some gigs were played as a 5-piece and a demo was recorded, before there was time for a change.

Jörgen switched to his main instrument(s)- Guitar & vocals. Jonas had to leave the band, on good terms. Andreas Morén switched to bass and backup vocals. DA kept gigging and entered the Gothenburg Deathfest bill, in 2005. On the bill were,among others Aborted and Insision. Soon after this show Adde decided to step out, due to a lack of interest in the genre.

A few shows were played as a 3 piece,before adding guitarist Attila Hollsén to the line up. Only a coupe of gigs were played with this line up, before original drummer Joakim left. Without a drummer, the band was in state of limbo for a few months.

In early 2007 Jörgen's old bandmate Mats "Masse" Blückert entered Dead Awaken and intense rehearsing began. May 2007 the band went back onstage at local Festival Mälarrocken, with killer acts like Behemoth. Unfortunately this ended up being the last show with Attila, who left for personal reasons.

A couple of guitarists were auditioned, before deciding that enough damage was done as a 3-piece. Not letting the change stop the tank, we went straight back into the trench and kept gigging. A few shows were done with Vomitory, before entering the studio,to record the debut album.

During the recording, in the fall of 2010, the band decided to part ways with long term bass player Andreas. He wanted to focus on his other band Bleeding utopia. Determined to not let this slow us down, Jörgen did all the guitar, bass and vocals in the studio.

After all the studiowork was done, a deal was secured with Abyss records.

Continuing as a 3-piece with session bass players Magnus Wall/ Jonas Stålhammar (Both former ABHOTH members), the road was hit again, with labelmates Entrench.

After a number of well recieved demo's, it's time to declare war upon the world, with the debut album "Where hope turns dripping red".
