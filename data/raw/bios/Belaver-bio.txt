Belaver (former frontman of doom-folk band listenlisten) is the solo project of NYC-based experimental folk artist B.E. Godfrey. In 2014, Godfrey released 'Wild Desperation' featuring collaborations with country legend Robert Ellis and Deep Cuts' Chase Harris. Drawing on the dark lyricism of his work with listenlisten, Wild Desperation was a narrative take about murderous men. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Belaver">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
