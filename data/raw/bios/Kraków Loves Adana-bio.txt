Duo from Freiburg, Germany, active since 2009.

Personal ... minimalistic … passionate ... it's not easy to describe the sound of German duo Kraków Loves Adana. Deniz Çiçek and Robert Heitmann use very little instrumentation. It's just guitar and voice. Yet, it isn't really what you'd call guitar music. At least not in the traditional singer-songwriter sense. Deniz Cicek's voice is quite complex and Robert Heitmann accompanies her with very simple, distorted sounds. Creating very dense and haunting songs. Tracks like “Your ego is a digital monster” or “Cold/Closed” start soft, almost brittle and build up to a loud, hissing and roaring wall of sound leaving Deniz battling the noise singing “Love was always a fragile kind of truth”.
