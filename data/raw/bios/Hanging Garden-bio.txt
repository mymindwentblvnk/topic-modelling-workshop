Hanging Garden was given birth in 2004, playing heavy, doom-oriented metal music. Over a decade, three albums and numerous line-up changes later, the bands style has evolved to a more melodic, contemporary sound. While still retaining strong roots in metal music, Hanging Garden now possesses a versatile, many-layered style of playing, drawing influence and inspiration from music and art far and wide.

First started as a brainchild of Matti Reinola and Ari Nieminen, the band with a complete line-up was put together in 2005. Soon signed by Spikefarm, the band’s first album, Inherit the Eden, was released in 2007, followed by a more post-metal sounding TEOTWAWKI in 2009.

The third album, At Every Door, featuring several line-up changes, was released by Lifeforce Records in 2013. On said album, Nino Hynninen had joined the band playing keyboards, Antti Ruokola had taken the place of Janne Jukarainen in drums, Toni Toivonen had replaced Ari Nieminen on vocals, and Jussi Kirves was recruited as the bassist after Matti Reinola had left the band. Style-wise, the band had taken a significant step away from the classic doom genre on At Every Door, flirting with various styles and genres beyond metal.

The fourth album, Blackout Whiteout, takes the changes further by flirting with various styles and genres beyond metal. Released in September 2015, this album has incorporated classical instruments, varying vocal styles, and boasts a many-faced dramatic arc spanning from crushing heaviness to ethereal mellow tunes, and back again.

Their most recent album, I Am Become, was released in October 2017.

Just after the completion of Blackout Whiteout, Antti Ruokola leaves the band. Sami Forsstén, known to many of the members from earlier projects, fills the vacant seat. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hanging+Garden">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
