Mutiny is the name of at least eight artists:

[1] A Melbourne, Australia, folk punk band, formed in 1991, which has released five albums / EPs.

[2] A band formed by Jerome Brailey (aka Jerome Brailey And Mutiny), after he left Parliament / Funkadelic, when George Clinton's mothership splintered, at the end of the 1970s.  Brailey and Glen Goins were working on Mutiny's concept, when Glen's untimely death occurred, in 1978.  Brailey continued on with the vision and formed the group, which performed in a style which is similar to the classic p-funk style, with a lot of emphasis on dual lead guitar work. Their first album was "Mutiny On The Mamaship" (1979, Columbia). The album was released a year after Brailey left Parliament / Funkadelic, due to a financial dispute. The original album featured a lyric sheet as well as artwork, including a disparaging depiction of Parliament / Funkadelic leader George Clinton.  They has released four albums and one compilation album, between 1979 and 2000.  Brailey was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in 1997.

[3] A Vancouver, BC, Canada, anarchist crust punk / grindcore band. Their self-titled d√©but EP was released in 2009 on four on DIY Canadian labels, then re-released by Moshpit Tragedy Records as a full-length album, (sliding-scale digital download). Musically, Mutiny can be compared to the likes of Disrupt, Extreme Noise Terror, Napalm Death, Dropdead, Warcollapse, etc; lyrically, the focus is on tackling a range of socio-political issues from a progressive anarchist and anti-capitalist perspective. Also noteworthy to mention is that Mutiny features members of such prominent crust bands as Leper, Self-Rule and Iskra.

[4] A New Jersey, USA, metal band, who signed to Roadrunner Records and then changed their name to Mutiny Within.

[5] A Brixton-based DJ and producer duo (Dylan Barnes and Rob Davy). They are best known for their 2001 track "The virus" but changed their band name into Mutiny UK due to confusions because of various other artists with the same name.

[6] An Arcata / Eureka, CA, USA pirate punk band.

[7] A Colorado, USA straight edge hardcore band.

[8] A Los Angeles, CA, USA, thrash band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mutiny">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
