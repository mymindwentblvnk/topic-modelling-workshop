Syth are a heavy metal band from Glasgow, Scotland, UK. They play in a traditional, keyboard-free style and draw influences from the likes of Iron Maiden, Thin Lizzy, Metallica and many other classic metal acts.  Combining power metal riffs with melodic, soaring solos and precise, powerful rythyms, they are widely tipped as a band to watch on the Scottish metal scene.

 They are fronted by vocalist, Niall Russell, ably backed by guitarist Baz Fitzsimmons. Bassist Allen Bell and drummer Mark Connelly make up the rhythm section. 

Their first full-length album, Warzone, was recorded towards the end of 2005 and finally released on 12th April 2007. 

After a brief split during which the various members pursued other projects (Fitzsimmons with Burning Earth and Bell with Maiden Scotland amongst others) the band reunited to record "The Reckoning". With guitar duties handled by Fitzsimmons and Russell, the album showed a marked improvement in song-writing, production and musicianship while still showcasing the band's hard driving traditional metal style . Many of the songs showcased themes of conflict, and it was fitting that the album's launch was marked by a benefit concert for the Erskine Home, which cares for disabled ex-servicemen. In the wake of the release, the band received radio play and rave notices from Tom Russell on 96.3 Rock Radio. 

The band are currently preparing for a fresh assault on the Metal world with upcoming gigs across Scotland and a first foray to London.
