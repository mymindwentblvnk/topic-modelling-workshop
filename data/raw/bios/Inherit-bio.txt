1. INHERIT is the UK based hardcore/crossover band. Heavily inspired by classic NYC acts, INHERIT delivers quality hard riffs and positive message. Keep checking www.inherithc.com

Some formulas never seem to fail. Nothing can beat hard riffing with meaningful lyrics. People are always hungry to hear music that makes them feel like wrecking the dancefloor or stage diving whilst blasting a song on headphones 10 minutes before their job interview.

At its essence hardcore is more than music. INHERIT, from London combine thrash/crossover guitar work with NYHC grooves and lyrics that go deeper than the usual tired clichés. Aggressive tunes to help you keep a PMA at a time when this world seems to be heading towards full collapse… Don’t lose hope. – PB

EP out soon on Reflections Records.

The limited edition debut single of 2000 copies quickly sold out all over japan, resulting in CRADLE releasing the single in the US, Europe and Australia. CRADLE's album titled "Attitude," to date, has already sold over 14,000 copies worldwide
