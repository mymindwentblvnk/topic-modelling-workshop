Trisector aka Otto Hassinen was inspired by music from an early age, influenced by the sounds blasting out of his Commodore 64 and the Bruce Springsteen and Beatles tapes his dad played in the car. After hearing the amen break on an LTJ Bukem set from Roskilde Festival in Denmark, drum+bass became essential listening and, aged 11, he got his first PC so he could create it himself using tracker software and samples. 

Otto unleashed his first release in 2004 on UK label Heavy Disco as one half of Finnish breakbeat/dubstep duo Takomo. Aided by DJ support from breakbeat heavyweights Annie Nightingale, Jay Cunning and Tayo, ten Takomo releases followed on labels such as Botchit, Destructive and Urban Graffiti. DJ dates came thick and fast, presenting the boys with a chance to play all over Europe from Finland to Spain and Russia to the UK. 

In 2007 Otto rekindled his relationship with drum+bass, redeveloping his sound at 170bpm under the name Trisector with DJ support from Blu Mar Ten, ASC, Muffler, Physics and Resound. It wasn't long before Hospital Records snapped up his tracks for sister label Med School who delivered two Trisector singles "Morning Rain" and "Lifeforms" to an unsuspecting drum+bass fraternity in 2009. These tracks were championed by High Contrast, Nerm (BBC radio), London Elektricity, Survival, S.P.Y, Kasra, Loxy, Mutated Forms and Chris.SU among others. 

Heading into a new decade, Otto is busy running a monthly night called Science in his hometown Helsinki and continues to be a prolific DJ armed with a plethora of new dubs and old school twelves. Trisector is definitely one to watch!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trisector">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
