Taking cues from Les Savy Fav, The Talking Heads, and the Dismemberment Plan, St. Louis' So Many Dynamos formed in late 2002 and includes Nathan Bernaix (guitar/vocals), Aaron Stovall (keyboard/vocals), Griffin Kay (guitar/vocals), and Clayton Kunstel (drums). 

Following an EP on Ambivalent Records in summer 2003, So Many Dynamos released its debut full-length, When I Explode (mixed by the Dismemberment Plan's Jason Caddell), in 2004 on Skrocki Records. Flashlights, which expanded the band's sound with a four-piece horn section and 30-member choir, arrived in September 2006. After extensive touring, writing, and recording, the band released "The Loud Wars" on Vagrant Records in June 2009 (recorded by Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla). In August of that same year, founding guitarist Ryan Wasoba announced his departure from the band; making him the second Ryan to quit So Many Dynamos (Ryan Ballew quit shortly after the release of When I Explode). He was replaced by former Target Market front man and St. Louis heavyhitter Nathan Bernaix.

The band currently plays songs in peoples vans.
