2) William Thomas Burnett from Texas. 
Born in April 1977, Mr. Burnett spent his childhood buying tapes like Eazy E, 2 Live Crew, AC/DC, Metallica, etc and listening to his walkman on the back of the schoolbus. On the weekend he would watch endless hours of MTV, taking in all of the 80s hits. Later in his youth it was skateboarding and punk, with Fugazi, Minor Threat, and local band, Big Drag, being big. 

Speculator then began to visit as many live shows as possible seeing every type of music all over Texas. Bands like Stereolab and Magnetic Fields helped with the crossover to electronic and dance music. William did not realize what kind of influence all of the weirder “experimental” stuff he began listening to at the time like Can, Kraftwerk, and Throbbing Gristle would have on him later.

The rest is history. Speculator has now deejayed all over the USA and Europe as well as organinzing quite a few tours and events in the US for many European and North American artists. Speculator even released a record with Danny Wolfers (Legowelt) called Smackulator and also has a solo project called Grackle. Speculator continues to live in Brooklyn, NY and currenty deejays several times a week and spends the daytime hours sorting records at The Thing (the infamous $2 record store). Speculator and his more often than not deejay partner, Jeremy Rodriguez (Chupacabras), started a radio show on www.eastvillageradio.com called Short Bus Radio where you can hear him play every Monday… <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Speculator">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
