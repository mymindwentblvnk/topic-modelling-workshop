2) Paganus is a heathen folk rock band from Sweden, who "give a voice to forests, bark, grass, river and bog". Formed in 2004 by Johannes Söderqvist, they recorded a 5-track EP "Memento Mori" in the summer of 2005, which a reviewer dubbed 'forest-rock', a genre title which has been associated with their music ever since. They see this as a shorter way to say 'Really heavy folk rock with influences of both Scandinavian and Celtic folk music, with a touch of prog, stoner and psychedelica'.

Their 2007 full-length "Skogsrock" was released on their own label Earth n Wood and was distributed by the giants of Scandinavian prog Record Heaven.

Current line-up:

Johannes "Hampe" Söderqvist - Lead vocals, guitar, mandolin
Maria Larsson - Mandolin, violin, backing vocals
