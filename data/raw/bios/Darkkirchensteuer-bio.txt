Darkkirchensteuer was a German-based black metal band from the town of Wülfrath, formed in late 1999. Consisting of one man, known only as  Beafsteak. Lyrically, the music consisted primarily of humour and occasional anti-christian themes. Discography includes a demo and two full lengths. After the production of the second full length in 2004, Beafsteak decided that he would not carry on with the band.

The band is “well known” for the music video Leb Doch Selber!
