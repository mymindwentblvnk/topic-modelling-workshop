GROMS ("God Rules Over My Soul") was a Norwegian Christian groovy death metal band that formed in Kristiansand in 1992. In 1993 they toured in Poland and on December 21st, 1994, their one and only album "Ascension" was released on the Arctic Serenades label as their first release. There were reports of a second album "I Beseech Thee" but nothing more came out of it. As guitarist Hans Dalen left the band they split up. Torodd Fuglesteg, the man behind Arctic Serenades, is a very anti-religious person and the relationship between label and band resulted in severed ties. Their album was re-released by Pleitegeier Records in 1996.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/GROMS">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
