Echoes Of Yul is a duo from Opole, Poland. They play slow and atmospheric droning doom. In 2009 they released their selftitled full length trough 'We Are All Pacinos Records'. Limited to only 500 copies and mastered by James Plotkin!

Only one year later they have done a 3-way split with Guantanamo Party Program and Sun for Miles, also on WAAP Records.
