Warbeast Remains came to be after a couple of discussions and copyrightclaims by other bands.
Previously known as Warbeast MMVIII and "Warbeast" before that, they have finally settled with this name.
With "Remains" implying that they will always stay the Warbeast they were in the beginning.

Warbeast Remains is a Belgian band, wich was founded in 2008 under the name "Warbeast" in Antwerp, but after copyright troubles with the american "Warbeast" they were forced to change their name.
First it was changed to Warbeast MMVIII, but because the decision was rash and made in a time with a lot of stress, they changed their minds after a while and gave the band the name Warbeast Remains.
