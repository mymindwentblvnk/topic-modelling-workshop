The Focus Group is Julian House, a graphic designer by day who has designed cover art for Stereolab (BBC Sessions), Broadcast (all albums) and Primal Scream (Exterminator), among others. He works for Intro in London, UK.

The music of the Focus Group is a fantastical cut-up of old library sounds and exotic flourishes; a sixties-inspired pastiche of short tracks and technicolour samples.  House's work is released through GhostBox, the label he started with his friend Jim Jupp, who releases records as Belbury Poly.

The Focus Group have currently got four records; CDR LP "Sketches and Spells", CDR mini-LP "Hey Let Loose Your Love", "We Are All Pan's People" and in 2013 a fourth album was released: "The Elektrik Karousel".

The Focus Group collaborated with British band Broadcast in the fall of 2009 to create "Broadcast and The Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults Of The Radio Age". This has been critically acclaimed and was awarded The Wire's best album of 2009.
