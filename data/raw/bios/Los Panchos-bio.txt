Los Panchos was formed by the Mexican musicians Alfredo "El Güero" Gil, José de Jesús "Chucho", and the Boricua Hernando Avilés in 1944 in New York City. Their romantic boleros have caught the ears of an international audience. Latin America still regards them as one of the best trios ever.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Los+Panchos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
