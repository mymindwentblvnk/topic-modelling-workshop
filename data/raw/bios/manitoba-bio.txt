1. Richard “Handsome Dick” Manitoba

2. The former alias of Dan Snaith, an electronic musician from Dundas, Ontario, Canada. Snaith renamed himself Caribou in 2004 under threat of an American lawsuit by Richard "Handsome Dick" Manitoba, who had used the surname professionally since the 1970s but had not released any music as a solo artist.

Manitoba's critically acclaimed album "Up In Flames" has since been re-released under the Caribou name and listed as such in discographies.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Manitoba">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
