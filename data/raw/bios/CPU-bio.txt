CPU is Samy Guediche (originally from Switzerland) who comes from a guitarist/song writer background, enhanced by jazz studies and electronic music production. He moved to Santa Cruz, close to San francisco, California, and in 1998 started a recording studio with Nicolas Oesch, one of the founders of Biodegradable years after, and produced various local solo artists and bands, as well as his individual projects.

He started his solo project Central Processing Unit (CPU), a very personal sound, on the dark cutting edge of the experience.  The new project received an immediate and strong response from the dance floor, the core of the party that happens in the darkness of the night, where Samy concentrates his efforts to extract the pure essence of the experience. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/CPU">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
