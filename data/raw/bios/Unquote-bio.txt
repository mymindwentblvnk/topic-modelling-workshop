Saint-Petersburg is a breeding ground for exciting new electronic music and Unquote is another young talent to emerge from Russia’s second city. Fans of Hospital and Med School will already be familiar with his warm affecting sound. His deep dubstep remix of Bop‘s “Enjoy The Moment” came out on Med School
and the beautiful “Hours Have No Reverse Motion”, with friend and collaborator Mr Sizef, featured on Hospital’s “The Future Sound Of Russia” compilation. 
He describes his music as “hearing the sound of your soul” and the extravagantly titled “Hide Your Tears…” is no exception. Waves of rich strings, celestial synths and hearty bass are punctuated by monumental kick drums while a chopped up angelic vocal forms an infectious narrative. Epic and emotional, this is forward-thinking drum+bass with a disregard for the rulebook.
Definitely ‘one to watch’, Unquote’s productions have already caught the attention of legendary German house DJ Tom Novy, as well as a plethora of tastemakers from the drum+bass community including dBridge, Instra:mental, Doc Scott, Loxy, Blu Mar Ten, Joe Syntax and ASC.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Unquote">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
