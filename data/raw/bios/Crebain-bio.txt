A one man (Ancalagon the Black) Black Metal outfit Hailing from the San Fransisco Bay area. 

Music: Stripped-down, simplistic, Lo-fi, tremelo dominated Black Metal with a few "Rocking" and epic parts here and there. Analogous to Darkthrone's "Transilvanian Hunger" and Nargaroth.

Vocals: High-pitched with Industrial vox effect similar to the style used on Leviathan's (USA)"The Tenth Sublevel of Suicide". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crebain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
