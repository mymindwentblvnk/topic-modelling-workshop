"Behold! The Monolith crush your pathetic skeletal frame with their Doom power....this is one bad-ass, maniacal, beast of a record that should put this band on the fast track to subgenre dominance and larger stages to hold their chaos."
Brian Krasman - Meat Mead Metal  

"Behold! The Monolith have really outdone themselves with this one. I always knew this band was good but I didn't expect this. 'Defender, Redeemist' is my first favorite album of 2012. It is a flawless album that should push the band to the next level of popularity. Killer stuff...........10/10."  -Doommantia.com  

"The L.A. based riffers summon High on Fire's hesher fury on their second album. Partial credit for this is due to HoF/Neurosis producer Billy Anderson, who helped this power trio capture its pummeling rhythms and burning guitar work. The result is eight thrashing tracks of bullish, doomy Metal."  -Guitar World Magazine  

"If a bong-ripping demon rose from the fiery underworld to impregnate Motörhead, their resulting hellish lovechild would undoubtedly be Behold! The Monoloth......like an auditory journey through the old wizard-covered highschool metalhead’s notebook you know you’ve got buried somewhere in your room, this album oozes pure ass-kicking aggression."  -CVLT NATION
