Isacaarum is a black/death metal/grindcore band from Czech Republic. They recorded their first track in 1995 and their music style is still evolving with each new album (spermetal, nihil metal, sado black grind..), but it is always fast, agressive and perverse. Their last realeased album "Shibari Kata and other practises" is amazing music and we can only wait what will be the next... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Isacaarum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
