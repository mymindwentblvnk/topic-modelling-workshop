This is how it starts: a riff, a barrage of drums, an alright shouted out into the darkness and bang! The third release by the TRASHMONKEYS, that incredible rocknroll band from yeah, you heard right Bremen / Germany that has been causing teeth to chatter and concert goers around the globe to hyperventilate since 1998, who have been getting people to shake, right down to the very last uninvited guest, with their high-voltage songs that aim straight for your central nervous system: the third record by the TRASHMONKEYS is finally here and one neednt say anymore, because The Maker is everything youve ever wished for, leaving you speechless and ready to simply press repeat. In 1998 the CRAMPS took the English-German quartet on tour with them, shows with THE HIVES, LINK WRAY, BEATSTEAKS, THE KILLERS. THE HELLACOPTERS and many more followed and after that the long overdue headliner binge. NME and Q were spellbound and enthused at length, the Italian late show le iene chose Sundays as the opening track, and word of the TRASHMONKEYS spread like border-crossing wildfire amongst the scenes across Europe. Following Trashmonkeys (1998) and Clubtown (2002), the latest lunge is the biggest and it would be so nice to just sit back and watch the band pull their finger out, if one werent one of the many people in the front row shouting out alright and dancing their way towards the white light. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trashmonkeys">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
