Infinite Livez, MC, ex-Bethnal Green, now Berlin-based. 
The enigmatic Infinite Livez truly is at the extreme, taking existentialist hip-hop to a whole new level of, er, existence! He has released a solo album on Big Dada in 2004, and 2 subsequent collaborative releases with Swiss minimal-electro-jazz group Stade, as well as numerous side-projects and experiments.
