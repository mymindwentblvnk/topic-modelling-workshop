Jay Jenkins born October 12, 1977 in Columbia, South Carolina), better known by his stage name Jeezy, formerly Young Jeezy and Lil J, is an American rapper and actor signed to Def Jam Records. In 2001 he released his solo debut album Thuggin' Under the Influence, under the name Lil J, which featured production from Lil Jon. In 2004 he signed with Bad Boy Records and joined the group Boyz N Da Hood, whose self-titled album was released in June 2005. In 2005 he released his major label debut, Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101, and has since released 2006's The Inspiration: Thug Motivation 102 and 2008's The Recession. He has plans to release Thug Motivation 103 in late 2009, and a collaboration album with Akon sometime in 2010.

Fitting in with the Southern style so popular in the current age, Jeezy raps frequently about his experiences selling drugs in the streets of Atlanta.  His album "Thug Motivation 101" features several songs whose choruses and lyrics overtly reference his criminal past, such as "Trap Star," "Trap or Die," and "Go Crazy."

The same album also features a song dedicated to his former partner Mad Lou, who is currently incarcerated. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Jeezy">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
