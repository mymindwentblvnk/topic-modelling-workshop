Yogth-Sothoth is a Death Metal band from Medellin (Colombia). Project initiated by Carlos. Edwin and Victor (they are from Planta Cadaver) joined to form Yogth-Sothoth at the end of 2002 to continue on the path of bestial Death Metal, but now, faster and with more destiny. After many changes of drummers, Mauro joined, also of Planta Cadaver. Together, they compose material, working parallel to Planta Cadaver. In 2007 Klisgor replaced Edwin. Yogth-Sothoth is a being of the mythological darkness of Abdul Alhazred; he lies in space-time chaos in eternal sleep and awaits his awakening to destroy all the living. Band lineup is: Victor (bass), Carlos (guitar), Klisgor (vocals) and Mauro (drums). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yogth+Sothoth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
