Predation is the baby child of Bas Zijlstra and Erik Jeroense. The baby sounded quite like Drum'n'Bass.

It all started at February the 31st, Bas and Erik just started to create some music because they were just plain bored. Bas did have a few years of music-production experiences and Erik really wanted to learn it too. Because of that they produced some Drum'n'Bass. It started out rather tough, and the music wasn't that great.

But in May Predation had their first live-gig in a small village called "Buren". It all went well and the DJ'ing went nice and the people there were happy.

But after a short time Erik and Bas thought "Hey, we should try a diffrent approuch at our music!" And so they did, and the new Predation sound was born.

Sekano, nowadays the Predation band-nigger, joined Predation in May. So Predation will be raving more than ever! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Predation">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
