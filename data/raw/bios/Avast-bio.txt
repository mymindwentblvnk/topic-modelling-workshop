2) AVAST are a three piece punk band from Tampa, FL. Based in the Seminole Heights neighborhood, AVAST rose from the ashes of erstwhile zombie band Ghost Town Gridlock, nabbing former GTG members guitarist Steve Whittum, bassist Dave Francois and drummer Dave Fleege.

After writing a few songs and playing around Tampa Bay, Fleege left the area for Portland, Ore, leaving the band drummerless. Luckily, they stumbled upon Sven Anderson, a local radio guy and all around decent person. 

AVAST is a semi-part time band, but their new record, The Heights EP is out now and available to listen to on Last.fm or purchase on avastrocks.com. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Avast">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
