The beginnings of 66crusher can be tracked back to the late 90's in Bergen, Norway, but the solid fundations were laid during 2001-02, when guitarist Jonny Wolf and bassplayer Øystein Kummen joined drummer Håkon Obdsaija Bergstad and frontman and main composer Jarle Olsvoll. The band released a couple of demos and played afew local dates until deciding to record their debut album in 2005. «Truth Unmasked» was released in 2007 on the American label Misanthropica Enterprises and garned considerable praise world-wide. 2011 saw the release of 66crushers sophomore album «Blackest Day», a more composition-focused effort where strong melodies and great riffs was the main focus. By 2009 Jonny had parted company with the band, and was replaced with Hellish Outcast's Martin Legreid. The drums for the third album, «Wanderer», was recorded at Conclave and Earshot Studios with producer Bjørnar E. Nilsen, who works with bands such as Taake, Helheim, Vulture Industries etc., whilst all the guitars, bass, vocals and keys were handled by the band themselves. As with the previous albums, mixing was in the hands of Herbrand Larsen (Enslaved). This time the main focus was to write an interesting and progressive thrash album, but also incorporate the now famous 66crusher melodics.
