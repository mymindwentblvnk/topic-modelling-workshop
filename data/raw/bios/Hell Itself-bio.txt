Aggressive groove-based death metal from Sydney, Australia.
Tracks are hook-laden, skull-crushingly heavy, rhythmically sophisticated and spine-wrenchingly moshable. There is a clear respect for the tradition (echoes of Suffocation, Cannibal Corpse and Decapitated), but more importantly a unique and genuine brutality that sets Hell Itself apart - and defines them - as a straight-up death metal band with a strong focus on violently heavy death grooves.
Formed in late 2006 by guitarists Jay Miller and Jarod Woodcock and joined in 2008 by vocalist Loz Lamy, Hell Itself in 2009 released the formidable, independently produced demo album 'ART OF DEATH'. Stand-in members covered live rhythm section duties until the arrival in 2010 of Tristan Endacott on bass and Benito Martino on drums.
The latest release is a carefully crafted piece of death metal savagery, 'SELF SKINNED' - a 3-track EP available now through Grindhead Records for world-wide distribution.
Pre-production on a second full length album is complete and will feature Matthew Brownlow (Synperium) on the drums.
Live, the band continues to gain attention with a tight, powerful and aggressive set that unambiguously reflects the commitment these guys have to their music. What you hear on the recordings is what you will hear at their show, this band takes no prisoners. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hell+Itself">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
