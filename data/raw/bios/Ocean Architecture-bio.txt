September 2010Nashville

Like a blast of raw, progressive energy from the college town of Murfreesboro, Tennessee comes a group paving the way for aspiring musicians. Drenched in technical prowess and a desire to rewrite standards in mainstream music, MTSU quintet Ocean Architecture has risen in a remarkably short amount of time to become an intimidating presence. Members Nic Giordano (drums), Kyle Standifer (guitars), Joe Dorsey (keyboards), Eric Hodge (bass), and Parker Deal (lead vocals) employ a dazzling array of instrumentation and musical progression while retaining deep influences of hardcore, prog rock, heavy metal, and even classical and electronic. Founded by Giordano, Standifer, and Dorsey in the latter half of September 2010, the group soon expanded to include Hodge and, in late March 2011, Deal. 

Keyboardist Joe Dorsey and guitarist Kyle Standifer often work in tandem, combining their efforts to create beautiful harmonized lead lines. Meanwhile, Giordano and Hodge pull together to form a pulsating rhythm section as Deal pours heart and soul into the microphone.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ocean+Architecture">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
