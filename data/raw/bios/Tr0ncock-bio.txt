One of Kyle Stanfield's friends (Christian Pike aka The Black Witch) was starting a black metal band and wanted help with the name.  Right off the top of his head, Kyle came up with "Tr0ncock" as a joke.  Later on Kyle Stanfield started an electronica/metal infusion project.  It didn't take him long to decide on the name.  For this project he decided to take a stage name, "N3rd4tr0n" (Nerdatron), which he got from a name an ex-girlfriend used to call him.

Tr0ncock is an experimental EBM/darkwave/electronica black/death metal project with lyrical themes ranging from weird stuff, N3rd4tr0n's penis (metaphorically and literally), to N3rd4tr0n's unrealistic dreams (as in becoming "World Meritocratic Dictator"). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tr0ncock">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
