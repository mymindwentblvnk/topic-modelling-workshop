The idea to start a Folkmetal band, was in the mind of our founder Peter a long time ago. He started to search for band members, but due to extreme lazyness, it took about 3 years before something useful came out that could be described as music.

After a long time of band members coming and going (and returning, to eventually leave again), we finally have a complete line-up.

Why the name Poppy Proudneck you might ask? (We know you don't, but imagine...) Well, pure coincidence actually. Lynn was adding our names on an Elvish name generator and submitted the name of one of our friends Heleen Camilleri Gioia, and the magical words Poppy Proudneck appeared. We all thought the name fitted us so that’s how it happened.
