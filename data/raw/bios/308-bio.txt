1) 308 are a blackened thrash metal band from Australia.

After forming in November 2007, 308 hit the local scene somewhat shrouded in mystery. Since their first live performance (february 2008) in support of Melbournes' Urgrund, they have been building a reputation for "vicious" live performances, their style of "thrash mixed with caustic black metal" receiving good reviews in local press. Their growing reputation has allowed them to share the stage with some of Australia's finest acts such as Alchemist, Excruciate and Gospel of the Horns. Their rising status within the local scene has recently been confirmed with the band receiving the honor of supporting swedish legends Dismember. 308 Have just released their first EP titled Atomic Assault. After recording this EP 308 parted ways with vocalist Minesweeper and guitarist R666 due to the members commitments to other bands. The current lineup now includes Silencer on Vocals and Jesse on guitar. A new recording with 6 new tracks is almost complete.
