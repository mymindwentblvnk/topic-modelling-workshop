 All Music and Lyrics by Carnal Befoulment 

 Carnal Befoulment was formed in 2007.  Through several lineup changes, they solidified with the current lineup. In 2011, They recorded Cunt Struck, a self distributed demo. The current lineup upholds the proud Milwaukee death metal traditions with members of mid-west greats such as Foetopsy, Morta Skuld, Branded at Birth, and Demented Torment making up it's roster. The result being, a brutal assault consisting of bass heavy riffage, furious blasting, and bone crunching late 90's style death vox. For fans of Suffocation, Devourment, Deicide, and many others. Plus anyone who supports local underground self released death scenes world wide. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carnal+Befoulment">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
