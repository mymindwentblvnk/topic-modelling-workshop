Rottenness is a Brutal death/grind band from Mexico.

The band was formed around 1994 in the city of Cancun, Mexico. Due there was no metal scene in their area they start to play shows around Mexico. Their first e.p. came out on 1998 “Blasphemous Gore Enjoyment” under the label Emerald City. On the year 2000 they entered the Oigo Estudios in Guadalajara to record their first full cd: “Inhuman Ways of Depravity”.
