Vaakevandring is a Norwegian unblack metal band that was active from 1996 to 2001. The name means 
"To walk and wake up the people" in Norwegian.

 Vaakevandring played atmospheric, epic unblack metal with keyboards and folk melodies. Their self-titled EP was produced by Stian Aarstad of Dimmu Borgir and gained world wide appreciation. Despite releasing only an EP, Vaakevandring's influence on the unblack metal scene was significant because they were one of the key bands to change the dominating "anti-satanism" lyrical theme led by the genre-founder Horde to a more philosophical and emotional direction.

Their position in the Christian metal scene is notable: For example, they were co-headliners with Antestor at Swedish Endtime Festival in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vaakevandring">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
