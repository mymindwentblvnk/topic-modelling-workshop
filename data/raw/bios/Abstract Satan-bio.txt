Abstract Satan dedicated this demo to the Americans of. The inspiration resulting from it can one demo ' 7512 well listen to: more simply more rauer and occasionally barbarianly seeming Black Metal with no song longer than three minutes persists. The fact that a Drumcomputer was used does not disturb far there the impact things play anyway from simpler and very in-usual nature is. Singing and guitar have more meaning. The singing is strongly distorted and always in dark clay/tone situations, but sounds it sometimes extremely intensively and destroying. Nevertheless sometimes the guitar predominantly plays simple and those which can be easily stamped of reef it bevels and bizarre melodies draws also as strange Soli to go through could. In such moments Abstract Satan a those have love-worth chaotic atmosphere quite their attraction have. Thus it lies near that demo is interesting ' 7512 only for friends of the primitive and simple Black Metals. Appeared that demo in an edition of 66 copies.
