There is more than one artist with this name:

1.) Execrate was founded in spring of 1994 by Andi Petry (g), Hansi Boer (dr), Stefan Epler (b) and David Diederichs (g). A short time later the line-up was completed by Marcel Reißmann. After a few concerts Marcel was replaced by Matthäus Parzonka.

In 1995 Execrate released the song "Forces of Storm" which appeared on the Pillepop sampler. Because of his health problems Matthäus could not sing any longer so Sven Stripp of Mortal Fear recorded the song for him. But this was only a temporary solution, so one had to search for a experienced vocalist and found him in Michael Bröker (Intestinal Ulcer). In July 1998 Execrate recorded their debut CD "Weeping Angel" at the Duisburger Anklang Studio. Until the end of 1999 the band played several gigs all over Germany.

After a long period of creativity in which the music was strongly improved, Execrate returns with some new members.

2.) Execrate is a blackened thrash metal band from Kapiti, Wellington, New Zealand. Members: Casey Carnage (bass/backup vocals), Chris (drums), Shaun (guitar/vocals).
