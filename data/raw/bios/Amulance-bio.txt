A self styled "Bash Metal" outfit out of Aurora, Illinois. The band was convened during the early 80's citing a line up of founder and guitarist Bob Luman, vocalist Rik Baez, bassist Tom Braddish and drummer Eric Wedow. Adding second guitar player Vince Varriale in January of 1986 AMULANCE issued a six track demo 'The Rage Within' to positive response. An album, 'Feel The Pain' on New Renaissance Records, followed before Wedow departed. His place would be taken by Tony 'T-Bone' DiVozzo. However, AMULANCE had folded by 1989.

DiVozzo would later join DARKLIN REACH for the 'Where Evil Dwells' album and later BLACK CUNTRY ROCK. Guitarist Bob Luman and drummer Eric Wedow founded BLACKLYST. A 1991 demo entitled 'Liars, Killers & Master Thieves' would be pressed up on CD format in 2004 by Germany's Iron Glory label.

In March 2007 San Jose based Stormspell Records announced the release of 'The Rage Within And The Aftermath', this set comprising the band's original 1987 'The Rage Within' six song demo plus previously unreleased demo recordings taken from the 'The Aftermath Sessions', recorded in 1988-1989.
