Rascalz are a hip-hop group from Vancouver, Canada, who played a crucial role in the artistic and commercial development of Canadian hip hop. The group consists of MCs Red 1 and Misfit, DJ Kemo, and B-boys Zebroc and Dedos.

Formed in 1989, the group released an independent album for Calabash Records in 1992. The titled album, Really Livin', was recorded under the name of Ragga Muffin Rascals. The re-worked major label recording was released the following year in 1993 by Sony Music Canada. The album won for Best Rap Recording at the 1994 Juno Awards. The group moved to BMG Canada in 1997 to record Cash Crop, which also won a Juno Award.  However, the Rascalz refused the Juno on grounds of alleged racism for relegating the best rap recording award to an off-the-air ceremony.  The following year, the Juno Awards televised the Best Rap award.  Global Warning was released in 1999 and their latest release, Reloaded, came out in 2002.

The group also tries to represent the four elements of hip-hop in their work.  This includes the talent of Red and Fit as MCs, Kemo as the DJ, Dedos and Zebroc as the b-boys, and through grafitti in the group's album artwork and music videos. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rascalz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
