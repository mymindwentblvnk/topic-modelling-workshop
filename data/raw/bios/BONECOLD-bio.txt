BONECOLD (Jack Allen) is an electronic music producer from the UK. Allen's garage and dub-step productions share many sonic similarities to the artists found on the Hyper-Dub lab, particularly Burial. Allen released his debut album, Somnipath, a collection of rhythmically abstract, ambient garage tracks in 2011 on the Broken Bubble label, based out of Manchester, UK. Subsequent tracks were later released through popular music-sharing websites, such as Bandcamp and SoundCloud. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/BONECOLD">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
