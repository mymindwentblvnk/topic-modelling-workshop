Violent Eve is an extreme metal band born in Madrid thanks to the guitarist David Ramos (Skunk DF, Dreamaker) and the drummer Edu Brenes (Skunk DF, Jorge Salan, Ex-Terroristars) in 2009. It wasn't difficult to find a suitable vocalist and bass player in shaping the project, such as Zyrus (Distance, Kaothic), and Dani Fernandez (ex-Dark Moor, ex-Inntrance). Finally, Diego LÃ³pez (ex-Silver Fist) joined them as second guitarist to complete the band known in 2010 as Violent Eve. In the second quarter of 2010 the band recorded their first demo with four tracks and began to send it to labels. Soon they receive some offers, chosing Noisehead records and agreeing to record their first album in Austria. In October 2010 the band went to Austria to record their first album at the Noisehead studios. Eleven tracks complete the album called "Eleven Reasons to Kill", released in January 2011.
