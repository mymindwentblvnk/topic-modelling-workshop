In Chasms Deep is a one man Black Metal project from Atlanta, Ga. Formed in 2011, but the first release was not until early 2013, with the demo, Sin. 

On September 14th, the band released the second EP, Catacombs. Catacombs is a concept album about the underground burial chambers in Paris, France. 

The debut full length album was released on November 28th, 2014, entitled "Symphony Of Horror". SoH boasts a more Symphonic style of metal, pushing the elements found in Catacombs to a new level. 

In 2017, the band released the new EP "As The Wicked Burn Below". This EP saw the band progress to a way more black metal inspired style, while still keeping the symphonic elements from the previous release. 

In 2018, the band released the 2nd full length album, entitled "The Realm Between". This album further increased the BM and symphonic elements found in earlier albums, while continuing to evolve towards something different. 

In 2020, the 3rd full length album The Wind and Her Lament was released, adopting a considerably more post-black and atmospheric style.
