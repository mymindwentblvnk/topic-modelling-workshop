Zardens is a Black/Death metal band from Li√®ge, Belgium.
It was formed by Warnacht (guitars, bass) in 2008 and later joined by guitarist, singer/songwriter Pascal Moraux (From Beyond, BEL).

The band is rehearsaling with 3 new members: Oliwar (drums), Fred Kienen (bass) and Ralph Wizard (second guitar).
Zardens is a powerful mix of extreme music, bringing in influences
from Black Metal, Death Metal and Thrash Metal particularly from Swedish bands of the 90s, blending them into a unique tone.
