Winter's Dawn is a black metal band from the frozen forests of England. Started in Feb 2005 the band has developed it's sound creating atmosperic black metal drenched with feeling. We are passionate about black metal, but want to use the style (often used to convey satanic themes) to deliver a positive message of hope in these dark times.
