Children is a riff-appreciation society formulated to combat boredom. With axes and clubs aided only by high power amplification, they aim to honor the torch lit by our metalien* forefathers . Brothers and sisters, please join them in their humble quest.

*(metal/alien)

P.S. Children started January 2007 in New York - jamming in the basement of the Cakeshop. The members are Adam Bennati - drums (Early Man) Jonny Rad - Guitar and Vocal (S.T.R.E.E.T.S) and Skyler Spohn Guitar and Vocal . They imagine they sound like ZZ Top, but they don't. It's more of a speed metal/prog kinda vibe, but sorta loose.
