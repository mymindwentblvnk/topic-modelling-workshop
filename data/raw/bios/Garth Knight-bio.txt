Producer and multi-instrumentalist Ged Leitch from Glasgow, Scotland.

With LinnDrum, Korg DW8000, guitar, and his love for 1980s synth rock at hand, Garth Knight brings his debut 5 track EP to light. Whether calling on the the music ingrained into his mind as a child of the 1980s, or drawing inspiration from artists such as Giorgio Moroder, Steve Stevens, Roger Zito, and Vince DiCola, Garth Knight hopes to share his instrumental labor of love born from a decade long gone. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Garth+Knight">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
