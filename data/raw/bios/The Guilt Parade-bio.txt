The Guilt Parade's line-up consists of five dedicated musicians from the south of the Netherlands who like to tear down stages with playing a brutal mix of death metal, rock and extreme heavy metal! Brutal, but beautifully intense. So make sure you have a good digestion when watching this band... you can't really expect these guys singing about spring rolls when playing live. 

The Guilt Parade excist from members and ex-members from bands like Symbolic, Collision, Charlie*Adler, Blind Sight and Remorse!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Guilt+Parade">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
