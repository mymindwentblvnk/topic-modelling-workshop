faustino sin cuello born in 2006 with the idea of two young emerging German araya and leandro sereño, however it was not until 2007 when he received training fairly stable, with german on vocals, on drums Leandro Ariel Araya and juan Lopez on guitars and Jose  on bass. This training played for the first time in the "Indepe Metal Fest" held at the Liceo Francisco de Quito. After this presentation Leandro and Jose left the band, leaving German in the work of singing and playing bass, and juan on guitars Ariel on guitar and Sebastian on drums. This training sponsored various gigs, most of them in the local community Lampa "Rigo Bar", then in 2008, Sebastian decides to withdraw from the band to spend more time studying, with the need for a stable drummer, Juan is given to this task, leaving the work of the guitars just Ariel. Since the training stable (for now) made a series of presentations at places like "el padrino" Conchalí Cultural Center (CDJ) and organized some gigs in the Commune of Lampa. Germain in 2009 I decided to leave the band due to musical differences, to emphasize his college career, this is how Miguel Toro falls in guitars and vocals and Hector Gajardo on bass. Finally with this training again begin to write and develop ideas for launching new themes for the month of November the "Promo 2009", in which it participates Rodrigo Figueroa on lead vocals.
the band is currently rehearsing... soon launch a new production
