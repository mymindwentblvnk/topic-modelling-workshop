Cronian is a progressive/avant-garde metal band from Norway and Sweden founded in 2004 by Vintersorg a.k.a. Andreas Hedlund (Vintersorg, Borknagar, Otyg, Fission, Havayoth, Waterclime) and Ã˜ystein G. Brun (Borknagar, Molested). The band's music is heavily symphonic with drum programming, combining melodic singing and harsh vocals, all aiming to create a very cold and cinematic feeling.
