Hardcore 918V was born in a garage in the deepest darkest part of Los Angeles Ca in 1985-6. Acquiring and firing members along the way the band moved on to Francisco studios in Vernon Ca. Writing songs and performing locally created a buzz around the LA area taking no prisoners. Never actually classified a metal band, 918v had many punk/metal influences to create a distinct sound of their own, not to mention their already misfit appearance.They released there first EP called Violent Mental Case in 1985. Signed to a indie label(with a shitty garage recording) continued to play locally and head out of state for an occasional show...eventually in 1992 the band unfortunately broke up due to personal issues, never was signed to a major label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hardcore+918V">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
