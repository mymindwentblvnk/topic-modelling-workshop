Eric Burdon & The Animals was a psychedelic rock band formed after The Animals disbanded in 1966.

In 1967, lead singer Eric Burdon planned to make a solo career, but then he thought about "New Animals". He took Barry Jenkins (from The Nashville Teens and the last "Animals" line-up, drums), John Weider (later member of Family, violin, guitar), Danny McCulloch (bass) and Vic Briggs alias Antion (from The Echoes and The Steampacket, guitar, piano, vibes) and recorded the single When I Was Young which charted in USA #15 and in Australia #2.

For the gig at the Monterey Pop Festival they were officially named "Eric Burdon & The Animals" and they performed their next single San Franciscan Nights (USA #9, UK #7, Australia #4, Germany #17, Netherlands #6 and Canada #14).

After releasing the first album, Winds of Change, they recorded in 1968 three other albums.

After the second album, The Twain Shall Meet, which featured the hits Monterey and Sky Pilot, Zoot Money (piano, vocals) joined the band for the third album, Every One Of Us, which included the hit single White Houses.

In July 1968, the fourth and last album of the band, Love Is, was recorded. For this album, Vic Briggs and Danny McCulloch were fired and guitarist Andy Summers joined the band. John Weider went on bass.

For this album the songs Ring of Fire and River Deep Mountain High were recorded and released worldwide in 1969.

After Eric Burdon jammed with Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Miles and Lee Oskar at the Newport Festival, he formed the Latino/Funk/Soul/Gospel band Eric Burdon & War which had international success in 1970 and 1971 before they disbanded and Burdon began a solo career.

Danny McCulloch released a solo album, Wings of a Man, 1969, with Vic Briggs as producer. He also released a Animals reunion album in 1993.

John Weider in 1970 went to the band Family and released his first solo album in 1976 and the following in 1987, 1988 and 1990.

Vic Briggs changed his religion and now records under the name Antion. He also released a 64-minute track.

Barry Jenkins manages a guitar shop in California.

Zoot Money went on a solo career and released many albums through the years.

Andy Summers joined the successfull 70s and 80s band The Police and also released a few solo albums.
