London based experimental producer and composer, Leifur James is returning with his highly anticipated second album Angel in Disguise which is due for release on the 24th April 2020 via Late Night Tales original artist label Night Time Stories.  An electronically steered opus, Angel In Disguise promises to explore the themes of love and loss through a masterful blend of harmonic vocals from James, nuanced electronic soundscapes and vibrant drum patterns - punctuated by bespoke visuals, directed by Balázs Simon. 

This news comes after an incredible few years for the artist. 2018 saw James release his esteemed debut album A Louder Silence on Night Time Stories and follow up remix EP that championed upcoming electronic talent including Bruce, FaltyDL and Whities producer, Coby Sey, on rework duties - projects which captured the attention of key tastemakers including Resident Advisor, Pitchfork, Mixmag, Electronic Sound, Future Music UK. 

An aesthetically driven artist dedicated to marrying powerful visual backdrops with sonic explorations, James began his collaboration with Hungarian director, Balázs Simon; producing the critically acclaimed, ‘Wurlitzer’ project in March 2019, seeing widespread support from the likes of Boiler Room, CLASH, the BFI, Directors’ Notes, Motionographer, the UK and Berlin Music Video Awards, the London Short Film Festival, Dublin International Film Festival and more. 

Performing to a sold out Barbican Hall, London at the start of 2019; followed by a headline European tour including sell out shows at Amsterdam Paradiso, the London Southbank Centre, and playing a number of tastemaker festivals in the summer, Leifur James will launch Angel In Disguise in intimate venues across Europe in May 2020, preceding further showcases in the autumn.
