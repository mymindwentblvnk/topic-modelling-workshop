“Griffon opened the evening with their war-beat like drums…”
– Northeast Performer

Griffon is proud to push forward from the hallowed streets of Boston, brandishing their own particular brand of hard rock music. Embracing their rock, metal, pop, and funk roots, Griffon's sound marches forward with a steady drive, demonstrating a power that is within us all. Focusing on the light that pushes away the dark, the band's sound is a mixture of intensity, catchy hooks, and powerful emotions that challenges the band members' boundaries, creating a constantly evolving passion for their own music.

“In almost every meaningful sense, Griffon [is] a throwback to a time where deeply lyrical songs were well-written… Griffon's live performance is top rate. I highly recommend seeing them perform.” 
– RockBoston Promotions

Griffon released their self-titled EP in May of 2007, quickly selling more than 500 copies. One year later, the band released three new songs online to very positive review, and with an intense focus on live performance, the band continues to develop their sound, their signature, and their legacy.

"I'm an old, cantankerous, jaded, and easily-bored music addict, and MA's Griffon… have yet to inspire a single yawn. Great energy, solid songwriting, and one of the easier to deal/ work with bands I've yet to encounter. Aside from an intelligent incorporation of melody, they've also got an aggressive edge - but without the repetitive, drop-tuned, single note chuggin' that everyone and their grandmother's aggro-rock/metal/alt band now employs to death."
