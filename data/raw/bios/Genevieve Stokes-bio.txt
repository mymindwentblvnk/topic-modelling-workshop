Rocks skipping across the water, aimless and endless summertime drives, hearts broken for the first time, and new beginnings flicker into focus like old Polaroids in the music of Genevieve Stokes.

She simultaneously echoes the nostalgic bliss of an oceanside afternoon and the anxiety of an uncertain crush set to a soundtrack of lo-fi piano bliss. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Genevieve+Stokes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
