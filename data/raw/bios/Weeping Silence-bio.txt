Weeping Silence has been in the metal scene since its formation in the mid-ï¿½90s and went through a long period of musical experimentation. Weeping Silence finally came together in 2000 and released their debut album Deprived from Romance, which proved to be successfull, with copies being sold out after a few years. The line-up on the debut album included Dino Mifsud Lepre on vocals. The musical direction on Deprived from Romance was inclined to a dreamy doom metal style, with clean dragging vocals. Weeping Silence also released one song on a compilation CD entitled Arch Music Compilation, which featured other established local metal bands.

Following their debut release, Weeping Silence decided on a change in musical direction, in order to encompass more varied and modern sounds. Rachel Grech was recruited on vocals and brought the power and musical direction needed to push the band to new horizons in the metal scene. Weeping Silence have played live as a female-fronted band in many rock nightclubs since October 2002, and attracted large audiences. This, combined with an inexorable will to work, pushed the band to prepare for their new release entitled End of an Era, which was recorded at Temple Studios, with the production of David Vella. Weeping Silence guitarist Raphael Grech was replaced following the recording of End of an Era, and Antoine Farrugia (Tony) joined as his replacement. Tony is a talented musician with vast experience in the metal scene, having previously played with various metal bands. Tony added the much desired soloing that WS considered necessary. In 2006 Allison Camilleri, trained as a pianist, replaced Mario Cilia on keyboards completing the current line-up.

End of an Era was well received by a number of record labels in Europe. The release, which is of an atmospheric gothic doom style, will be released shortly with Sleaszy Rider Records, Greece.

Weeping Silence is currently working on a new album. The material on this release is destined to sound heavier, with great guitar solos and rhythm, yet still retaining the atmosphere for which Weeping Silence has become strongly associated with. The recording in progress will also involve an ensemble from Enkor Choir Malta.
