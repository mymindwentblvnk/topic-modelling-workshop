Mr. Bear on NPR's Second Stage.

Mr Bear is the brainchild of Jack Bishop (Born May 10th, 1988 in Little Rock, AR), created in 2005 as a side hobby for Bishop to fiddle with instruments he didn't know how to play and attempt to make music.  It started as a collection of short instrumental/noise-Rock/experimental pieces and evolved in 2006 when Bishop began including lyrics.

Mr. Bear worked it's way into the Arkansas indie music scene in 2007 when Bishop began to perform live the songs that would soon come to make up the 2008 album, "These Machines".  Popularity for Mr. Bear grew along with anticipation up to and after the release of "These Machines" as Bishop vigorously promoted it's creation.  Upon release, "These Machines" was well received in Bishop's home state of Arkansas and continues to expand in it's Arkansas fanbase.  There is also a significant Mr. Bear fanbase in Alabama, oddly.

Bishop recently moved to Chicago, IL where Mr. Bear is now accumulating a fanbase there.

"These Machines" was self released by Jack Bishop on May 9th, 2008 with hand-made packaging.  "These Machines" was "Officially" released on January 13th, 2009 in association with the up and coming indie record label, Thru & Thru Records, based in Minneapolis, MN and Chicago, IL.  Re-release is professionally manufactured, features all new artwork and is available through Mr. Bear's official website (http://mrbearmusic.com) and the Thru & Thru Records website (http://thruandthrurecords.com). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Bear">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
