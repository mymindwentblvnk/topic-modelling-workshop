INCHIUVATU had formed on the holy Friday 1993, thanks to AGGHIASTRU, the creator of all artistic expression of the band.
“The Garden of the Sin” is the place where the human tragedy is exalted to give vent to an ephemeral art which wants to relieve human pain. The human being lives the conflict between life and the mistery of life , but he can never defeat it. “The Garden of the Sin” is surrounded with images of spirit and fairies that have nothing to do with the cristian vision of Hell, purgatory and heaven. It is the place of desolation, of doubts and vices, of anxiety and of ephemeral pleasures; but above all “The Garden of the Sin” is the place of the human being’s loss. There AGGHIASTRU, who can be compared to Virgilio, Dante’s guide, leads the visitor by the hand through the Garden which is dominated by the enigmatic face with three legs, the so called “TRINACRIA” (an ancient symbol of Sicily), through the dark paths of the INCHIUVATU reign, searching of the tragic truth which is contained in him work.
