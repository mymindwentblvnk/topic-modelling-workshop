JK Flesh is Justin Broadrick's latest solo project, one that’s been ongoing for some time but which he’d long delayed in committing to tape. With a focus once again on techno beats, but submerged under waves of guitar, JK Flesh’s debut Posthuman feels like Broadrick returning to his 90's dabblings in techno and hip-hop, whilst also expanding the scope of what a metal artist can do alone with the right equipment. 

The electronic crucible, fortifying blazing walls of distortion and iron wrecking-ball beats are influenced by acts like Throbbing Gristle, Test Dept., Dillinja and Ed Rush, and labels Renegade Hardware & No U-Turn.
