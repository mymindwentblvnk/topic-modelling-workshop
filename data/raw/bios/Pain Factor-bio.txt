Devin and Randy started Pain Factor as a side project mainly just recording back in 1998-99. Soon after, in 2000, they brought in an old friend by the name of Rocky to lay down the drums. Each of them had other bands and projects going on, so for some time they only worked on the Pain Factor recordings whenever time would permit, but eventually they realized that they had something that was worth a lot more than just a side project.

Pain Factor has quickly established themselves as one of the S.F. Bay Area's heaviest new hard rock bands with their self-titled full-length release and live performances all over the Bay Area in 2004. Songs like Pull and Lunatic Lover deliver a sexy feel from the vocals with heavy sounds from Black Sabbath to White Zombie with a little bit of Nine Inch Nails influence. On the other hand, 8 Seconds, Hands of God and Devil's Blood are dark and heavy with a very serious and deliberate lyrical content that gives listeners a glimpse into some of Pain Factor's own personal experiences and demons. With heavy driven guitars, melodic yet aggressive vocals that are full of constant energy, and an extremely solid groove set forth by the bass and drums. Pain Factor is a S.F. Bay Area group of four musicians who have all been friends in different circles for many years that are sure to leave an impression on every one who sees and hears them.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pain+Factor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
