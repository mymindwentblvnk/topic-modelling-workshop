Shakespeare in Hell is a New Orleans-based metal band who are committed to translating the work of William Shakespeare into Black, Death, and Gothic metal concept albums.  Taking their lyrics directly from the text of the bard's most well-known works such as Hamlet, Macbeth, and the Tempest, they weave intricate soundscapes of intense, melodic, and often brutal metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shakespeare+in+Hell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
