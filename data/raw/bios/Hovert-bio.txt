Hovert is an Experimental Depressive / Atmospheric Black metal one-man band from Russia, founded in 2010. Theme of despair, loneliness and suicide runs through every line of lyrics. Atmospheric and blurred sound carries listener into some cold, open area. Melancholic and sad melodies perfectly convey the mood of the songs. A hysterical, harrowing, howl of the vocalist breaks through the wall of sound. 

 There isn't much info available on the net for this one-man band. Tho, after some meticulous searches, I found that the song 'Безысходность' of the same entitled 2010 demo was part of a compilation album released by Niberu Records. 

 Also, It apears that the band will be co-releasing a second (and probably full-length) album in 2013 through Le Crépusucle Du Soir Productions and Nihil Interit records entitled 'Больше ничего (Nothing Else)'. You can already listen to 2 songs from the label's (Le Crépuscule Du Soir) official bandcamp. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hovert">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
