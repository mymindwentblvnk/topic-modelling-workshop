Whorelord was formed in Long Island, NY in early 2004 after the dissolution of 5th Faction, bringing together Danny Trapani and Mike Gulluscio of 5F with Samantha Camargo of This Year's Addiction. They recruited Jay Rupp to handle the lead vocals that summer and recorded their first demo, "You're All Gay". After playing some shows in Long Island, they recorded and released their second demo, "Objectify This", in the spring of 2005. They went on to play shows out of state, including a show in Cleveland with death metal legends Suffocation, Cryptopsy and Aborted. 

In the fall/winter of 2005, Whorelord returned to the basement to record their 3rd and final demo, "Assraped Again", featuring a drop in tuning to drop A. Some more shows were played, including a show with Dying Fetus. Jim Sarlo (of This Year's Addiction) was recruited in early 2008 to play lead guitar. In spring 2009, Whorelord entered Full Force Studios to record their half of a split with Phecaltopsy entitled "Sex Without Your Permission". 

Unfortunately, the lone studio release never saw the light of day, as the band slowly dissolved after a series of complications arose from the release of the split (including the breaking-up of Phecaltopsy). Jay left the band shortly after recording for the EP was finished in 2009, and interest slowly dissolved until it was decided that Whorelord couldn't continue in early 2010. Danny went on to commit his time to The Forrest Gump Mile High Marathon, while Mike, Samantha and Jim decided to ressurect This Year's Addiction. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Whorelord">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
