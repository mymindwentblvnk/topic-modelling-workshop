Vexatus came to life to give vent to the need to play death metal in the old fashion, the atmosphere of which dates back to the early years of this genre and the works of Autopsy, Grave, Asphyx or Entombed. The beast of Vexatus was born at the beginning of 2007, with Mike (vocals), Tomasz (guitar) and Svart (battery), on board. When Waldemar - the second guitarist – reinforced the team, it was possible to start rehearsing the tracks for the debut album.

At the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008, Piotr, a bass player, was added to the line-up. After months of playing together, the time was ripe to record the first album, which took place at the end of 2008. The album was recorded in Studio IX, in Swiecie (Poland) and the man behind the knobs was Michal Barski. The theme of lyrics focused on tortures, throughout centuries. The album was released at the end of 2010, through the RedRum 666 label.Having recorded the debut album, the already reduced line-up (Piotr resigned from duty) started working on a follow-up to the debut album. At the beginning of 2011, the band paid another visit to Studio IX, to record their sophomore album – ‘The Atom Pompeii’.

So far, the band has given only one live performance, which took place at the Metal Time Festival, in Nowy Staw, in 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vexatus">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
