NY raised and GA based dj/producer izo has been turning out hip-hop/breakbeat instrumentals for just over a year and a half since leaving behind the techno/dj scene and his alias (pupworm) in the past where it belongs. Utilizing old-school, lo-fi breakbeats fused with everything from 70 's R&B to anime and japanese film scores, izo has developed a style of cinemtaic hip-hop that exists on it's own without lyrics, but could always be enhanced by them.
