Protolith is a Northern Connecticut/Western Massachusetts based metal band that started in the Fall of 2009.  Their music combines elements of post-rock/metal, progressive metal, and more recently black/doom metal.  Their debut release "Light", was recorded at Valiant Recording & Engineering and released in Fall of 2010.

The "Sunsetter" EP was released on 9/25/2012 on Bandcamp for digital download and on CD. It was recorded by Mike Taylor (Warm), mixed by Bucky Masters, and mastered by Jeff Lipton at Peerless Mastering. This EP is to serve thematically and musically as a bridge between "Light" and the forthcoming "Dark" LP.
