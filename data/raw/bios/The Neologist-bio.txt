The Neologist is a musical endeavor created by James Lewis and Devin Walsh in 2009. Our mission is simple: to create and play the music we are fans of and what we want to hear for ourselves. We played in the band SeVeR for a few years, and when the band went its separate ways, we decided to create The Neologist as a musical outlet with no rules, boundaries, or limitations. As a two-man band we are able to make decisions in 2.3 seconds, have full creative control, and basically do what we want. We do everything ourselves, or with the help of a few friends, from the music, lyrics, artwork, videos, recording, etc…

To sum it up: We love metal. Some of our favorite bands are In Flames, Soilwork, Disarmonia Mundi, and Dark Tranquility to name a few. We write our music to sound like the music we love, and as I’m sure you can tell, those bands are some that we are clearly influenced by. We are not trying to be “ground-breaking” or “the next big thing”. We write and play metal we enjoy. Hopefully you will enjoy it too. If not, then maybe next album.

We both also might be part vampire. We have very pale skin, tend to enjoy darkness and the night more. The sun is not fond of our skin. We have pretty sweet human fangs. We have not tried someone else’s blood, so we won’t know for sure until we do that. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Neologist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
