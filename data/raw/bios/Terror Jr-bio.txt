Terror Jr is an American pop duo formed in 2016 in Los Angeles, California, consisting of former The Cataracs band member David “Campa” Benjamin Singer-Vine and singer-songwriter Lisa Vitale. Felix Snow, the third founding member, silently left the group in late 2017 for yet undisclosed reasons.

The group made their first appearance with their single “3 Strikes,” featured in Kylie Jenner’s “Glosses” short film. “Come First” became their biggest hit so far, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard Spotify Velocity chart. The pop trio released a musical project named Bop City on October 21, 2016 and the follow-up Bop City 2: TerroRising on June 16, 2017.

The group announced the final installment of the Bop City saga, The Girl Who Cried Purple on September 8, 2017 by releasing the project’s lead single “Holding Your Tongue.” Soon after it was also revealed their debut album would come out in 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Terror+Jr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
