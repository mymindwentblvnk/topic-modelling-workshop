Fernando Alvarado (born October 24th, 1975), is an underground artist known as LiL MaN G from Stockton,Ca. LiL Man began rapping in his late teens, attending high school with other Stockton rappers such as Knowledge Bone and Mr. Peebodie. LiL Man latter teamed up with Nasty Trey, Young Ren, and Wizard One to put out one of the city's most recognizable release "Doesia Click -Hard On The Grind." 

In 1996 the group released "Women,Cars, and Firearms" and changed the spelling of the group to "Doja Clik." This release also included Mr. Peebodie and Antidote as members of the group. 

Shortly after working on "Ren Da Heatmonsta - MudvilleKing" in 2009,  LiL MaN started Mudville Entertainment,L.L.C. and released "LiL MaN-This Ain’t No Mix”; a street album which hit the streets of Stockton, Ca latter that same year. 

Producing all music in his solo release, LiL MaN quickly recognized that as a business he needed to partner with other sources in order for Mudville Ent. to survive.  In 2010 LiL Man and producer DJ Smash teamed up to release "Knowledge Bone-If The Shoe Fits Wear It". Sights are now set for the 2011 spring release of "Bently Black- For The Money" with most of the album being produced by LiL MaN. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/LIL+MAN">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
