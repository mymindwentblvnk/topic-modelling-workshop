"Ikonoklast is a driven and highly-devoted group whose injection into the U.S. underground has pushed new boundaries in all directions and drawn the attention of even the most elite metal and industrial-heads. They pause only for an ethereal moment before pummeling the audience again with an onslaught of dark electronic sequencing, noise, and bone-crushing metal elements. It's no wonder that they'll often upstage their peers and are setting a new standard for modern metal and hard industrial groups with their mixture of "black industrial." Catch them on tour this summer and pick up their new release, "The Dawn " from the usual outlets."

The boys are currently writing and playing regional shows, gearing up to record a new single, and do another tour.  Ikonoklast is also currently seeking a agent/manager to work with on an upcoming European/Japanese tour. http://www.myspace.com/ikonoklast

Ikonoklast is a Phoenix,Arizona based heavy metal music|metal industrial band. They formed in late 1999 and have since released one full-length album, a single, and an EP and have appeared on a number of compilations and demos as well as remixes, over the course of which they have evolved from a succession of, as well as steadily pioneered a hybrid of, the styles of industrial metal, death metal, black metal, industrial and EBM. Ikonoklast is also notable among metal bands for their heavy use of living experience elements in their songs and albums. Their most recent album, ''The Dawn", described as a more experimental and atypical effort, has also contained elements of black industrial and progressive metal.

The band has toured and/or played with the likes of Mankind is Obsolete, Hardwire, Genitorturers, Mindless Self Indulgence, Only Flesh, Slick Idiot, Mower, Pinhed, Mushroomhead, Razorblade Dolls, Chant, Inswarm, The Vincent Black Shadow, The A.K.A.’s, Selfless, ohGr, American Memory Project, The Iris, Bad Acid Trip, Sixstitch, Chemlab, Wednesday 13, Paul Barkers’ U.S.S.A., AntiProduct, N17, Blessedbethyname, Skeleton Key, Asesino, Vehemance, Creature Feature, Eroticide, The Strand, Pelvic Meatloaf, The Strand, The Dreaming, Opiate for Masses , and Macabre.

== History ==
===The early years===
Ikonoklast’s roots lie in an outfit formed by guitarist Fred Newell and then keyboardist/guitarist Jonah Foree in Phoenix,Arizona in Nov./Dec. 1999. Their first line-up was completed with the addition of vocalist Keegan Moran, bassist Ryan Vangorder, and drummer Evan Wondergem, all high school friends. After a few practice sessions Keegan left the band and Jonah took over on vocals. They soon added additional friends, Tammi Jepson ..board, and bassist, to complete the line-up and start playing out live.
They started out under the name '''Iconoclast''', because of their desire to destroy religious and political icons & ideas as well as their burgeoning new industrial synth metal sound, influenced just as much by early United Kingdom|British industrial metal, industrial music, punk, and grindcor as much as it continued to remain firmly rooted in a conservative extreme metal approach; a facet of their music that eventually saw the band’s appeal spread out over a wider music audience.. They subsequently shifted to Ikonoklast''' in 2001 upon finding out that some other previous bands used the spelling with C’s instead of K’s. 

The earliest demo recordings of the band are strongly reminiscent of the early works of Al Jourgenson and Trent Reznor as well as a stripped down version of Front Line Assembly with the band's industrial driven approach and mechanical brutality. Another large influence came slighty later with Cradle of Filth's rising popularity in the U.S., and they came to further influence the band's dark keyboard and vocal stylings. These early (2000-2004) demos are very noisy and of a low-fi sound quality. In 2003 The band recorded some new demos with a new line-up consisting of Jonah, Fred, Sean, Evan, and Ryan “The Man, The Myth, The Legend” and the outcome was a successful and highly energetic blend of heavy guitars and driving electronic soundscapes. The vocal stylings of Jonah were transforming from noisy and electronically modified screaming to angry death growls and high squeels in the same song, which was to become a significant and influential element of the band’s sound throughout their career. The addition of Ryan, “The Man, The Myth, The Legend”, as a second guitarist as well as Sean contributing more intricate bass lines fattened up the sound. The band contributed the song, “The Filth Inside,” to the “Name Your Displeasure” compilation in 2001 and their rendition of Depeche Mode’s “Enjoy the Silence” to the Industrial Nation compilation "V3.0" in 2005.

===''The Suffering EP''=== 
In 2004, Ikonoklast proceeded to record a series of cuts to comprise their debut EP in Jalapaz's studio called Audio Confusion. However, due to a line-up change and the studios computer having a meltdown and a move to a new location only half of the album was recorded there. The Liar, The Thief, and The Whore, Enjoy the Silence, Angels, The Filth Inside, and Murdered Bliss was what came out of the Audio Confusion Sessions with Evan on drums. The other half was recorded at Byron Filsons studio in 2005 called Villain Recording. The Suffering, Communion, Recluse, Hint of Decay, Bibles and Child Porn, and Eyes of the Beholder came out of the session with Byron at Villain Recordings with Mike Soucy on drums. Ikonoklast added two early self recorded demos, “Machines of Violence” and "...And the Chaos Ensues", to the EP and called it done. They released it under the name of their own label called Screeching Harassment Enterprises. A video was made of the song "Communion" depicting a priest who molests a small boy and gets shot for this by the boy who promptly commits suicide. Ikonoklast went on many regional tours in support of this EP.

===”Dead Inside Single''===
Recorded at Byron Filson's studio, Villain Recording and released in 2006 on the label Screeching Harassment Enterprises, “Dead Inside” was the band’s first recording that the band wrote completely together with their new steady lineup. The band included the new song “Dead Inside” and previously released “Communion” to the single as well as a some B-sides and early demos to complete this release. “Stillborn” and “8921” were the two instrumental tracks. “Father” and “Cowboy Up” were two surviving lo-fi demos from the Audio Confusion recordings. “Restless, Restless” was a song created for a Howard Stern Show contest by combining the music of "Hint of Decay" with the lyrics of Vinnie Favale, a character on the show, and a clip of it was played live on his show. Also featured on this disc was a hidden remake of the Nine Inch Nails song, "Wish," as it was not listed on the cover. Ikonoklast also shot a video for the song “Dead Inside”. The band organized a group of friends and fans to travel together to Sedona, Arizona where guitarist Fred owned an older home, and spent 3 days and 2 nights shooting. The video was shot and edited by Ryan Hutman and Mike Marsh of the band Hardwire. The video was a tribute to George A. Romero's 1968 horror classic "Night of the Living Dead." It follows fairly close to the storyline of the original black and white version with the band members portraying main characters.
