Anghell was the first name of the rather short lived all-female Trash/Speed metal band from Detroit, US, that later would be called Bitchcraft, but that wasn't until 1996.

Anghell was formed somewhere in 1993 and as mentioned, would be a very short lived project. They managed to release a demo in '93, "FeMetal", before they split-up in 1996, but by that time, some of the members had already formed Bitchcraft. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anghell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
