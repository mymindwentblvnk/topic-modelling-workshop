Signer is New Zealand native Bevan Smith. He has released four albums under the Signer moniker, three of them on US label Carpark Records. 

The first two are deep dubbed out blissful slow minimal techno affairs. After these albums Bevan became more interested in releasing an album which more reflected his current listening and influences. The resultant album 'the new face of smiling' is also minimalist but brings guitars, vocals and live drums into the mix. It's close in manner to some Talk Talk albums and the Bark Psychosis records. The fourth album, Next We Bring You The Fire was released as a 10-track CD on New Zealand label A Low Hum and 8-track LP on Carpark.  It contains guest appearances by Ryan Mcphun of The Ruby Suns among others.

Bevan has worked on many other projects, including most recently playing with The Ruby Suns.  Other recent projects include Over the Atlantic (who have also been signed to Carpark) and Skallander, whose third album was released on UK's Type in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Signer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
