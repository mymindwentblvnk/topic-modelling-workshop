Bandcamp says:
Fate Unburied project burns from the musicians' need to find their own musical language that went beyond the patterns of modern metal. It's style is focused on Death Metal sound, surrounded however by many other influences, combining driven and dynamic riffs with melodic and inspired ones. A combination of power and atmosphere absolutely effective which creates a distinctive and varied sound.
