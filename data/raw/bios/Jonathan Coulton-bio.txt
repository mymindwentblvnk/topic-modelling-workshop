Jonathan Coulton is a geek rock / folk rock musician active since 2003 from Brooklyn, known for his songs about geek culture. He is best known for such compositions as "Still Alive" and "Code Monkey", as well as his cover of Sir Mix-A-Lot's "Baby Got Back". He is the Contributing Troubadour for Popular Science magazine and the musical director for John Hodgman's Little Gray Book Lectures.

Every week for a year Coulton released a new song for free on his website as part of his Thing a Week podcast, on topics as diverse as vengeful nerds, self-loathing giant squid, partially-imagined historical figures, and devotees of a certain Swedish prefab furniture store.  The Thing a Week project is now complete, and all songs can be streamed from his official website.  Many of the songs on the site can be downloaded for free. The song "Code Monkey" became the theme song to the G4 television show Code Monkeys.

Coulton's song "Still Alive" has been featured in Valve Software's game Portal (and has become a hit among the gamers who finished the game) . He also made a recording of this song called the "J.C. Mix" which is exactly the same except he is singing rather than Ellen McLain as GLaDOS. "Still Alive" went on to be featured in the game Rock Band, as well as Skullcrusher Mountain and Re: Your Brains <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jonathan+Coulton">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
