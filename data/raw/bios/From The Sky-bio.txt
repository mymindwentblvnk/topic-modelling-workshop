1) From The Sky were an instrumental band from London, England who created emotional guitar-led songs  in the vein of Explosions in the Sky, Mogwai and Mono. "It Fell...." was the first demo release by From The Sky in late 2005 and was a taster of what was to come from this young band.  The band's acclaimed first album 'Like Crystal in a World of Glass' was released on Sound Devastation Records in 2006. It can now be downloaded from http://www.archive.org/details/LostChildren066 - 'A Warm Place With No Memory' was the band's second release and can be download from http://www.archive.org/details/LostChildren043
From The Sky ended in late 2008 due to an injured drummer, but all four members have gone on to form the post/math/something band, Helsingfors, with a new drummer and continue to record and play shows under the new name. Band members also continue to be involved in Loss Of A Child and Final Light.
