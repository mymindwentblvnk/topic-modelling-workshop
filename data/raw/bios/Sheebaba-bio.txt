Sheebaba is Eliott Eccho & Prof. Costello - Noise, Drumloops and Poetry.

Eliott Eccho & Prof. Costello first stepped on stage as such at the Grand Opening of POKY - Institute of Contemporary Art in Mainz, in December of 2019. The duo performed a raucous set of songs that kept reverberating throughout the night. Three days later, their first single “1 2 1 3” was written which was released in December 2020.

On their upcoming single "violet" Sheebaba explore the dynamics of a same sex interest in a hetero sexual relationship between two people - "you like red, I like blue, we don't know what to do"



SHEEBABA is a lofi infused diy-duo, inspired by genre-bending acts like DEVO, not afraid to have noise passages in their live set that would make Thurston Moore proud, combined with a strong lyrical rawness à la Daniel Johnston, driven by fuzzy industrial, Dark Wave beats.
