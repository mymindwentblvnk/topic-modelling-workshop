"Heavy lo fi stoner psych jams lie within. Sounding like they travelled back in time to 1974, Black Majik Acid offer up a delicious selection of raw retro riffage that satisfies on every level - definite evil edge to the riffs, that live jam feel and 'in your loungeroom' drum sound, and reverb laden vocals that weave in and out of the mix. No filler in sight here, 6 tracks of awesome. Best played loud, but then again, those are words to live by."
