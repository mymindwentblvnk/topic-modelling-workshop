Just a couple of guys from Hamilton, ON making that sweet sweet death metal your mom hates. Crowns, the first album by Rat King Oligarchy, was recorded between 2015 - 2016 in a couple different basements. With a multitude of different influences that they wear on their sleeves, there'll be something to please and piss off fans of the most niche metal subgenres within these 9 thrash-tastic tracks. For fans of Skeletonwitch, The Black Dahlia Murder, Cattle Decapitation, Children of Bodom, Dying Fetus, Lamb of God, probably Slayer too. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rat+King+Oligarchy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
