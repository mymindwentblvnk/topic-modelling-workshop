Black Dementia was created in 1997 in Paris, France. They released in 1998 the first version of their debut demo “Sortiarius, Of Heathendom Born…”. Unsatisfied by too slow a pace, they made a new version of that demo in 1999, which received a good response from European fanzines, and in 2000 Black Dementia released a second demo tape entitled “Carmina Diabolica”, with the same features as the previous demo: fast-paced Black Metal with a soprano voice, displaying a deeper textual approach to Luciferian doctrines. 

As the band got more and more attention, especially in their home country France, they felt the  need for a real drummer instead of the drum machine previously used. So after the arrival of Drakhian as a guitarist and Necrose as a bassist right after the recording of “Carmina Diabolica” in 2000, Morten Siersbæk from Denmark joined to complete the line-up of Black Dementia. 

As a quintet, the band recorded their third demo “Proxima Thule” in 2001, a strong expression of will to enlightenment and purification. They participated to several compilations, and got a deal with the French underground label Aura Mystique Productions. 

In late september 2004, “Hyperborean Call”, Black Dementia's first Mini CD, was released and introduced elements of thrash to the usual fast and intense Black Metal that Black Dementia is known to play. Dame Pandora leaved the band some time before the release of "Hyperborean Call".

The French-Danish horde released their first full-length album ‘Dictum of Negation’ on Aura Mystique Productions in 2007, thereby pushing the limits of aggression and intensity even further. In 2008, Harm joined Black Dementia on the Bass.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Dementia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
