Antwerp, Belgium (2011 – 2015) 

Grown Below arose from the ashes of Timer in early 2011, continuing the path to the full album The Long Now with the same sound, but more evolved. With the rising of this fresh band the decision fell that from then on Matthijs (who previously was the singer of Timer) also took on the guitar and helped the band sound more like it should. Grown Below may be influenced by the usual suspects (Cult of Luna, Isis, Tool etc.) but they certainly go beyond being mere epigones. Mixing ambient and atmospheric pieces with beastly heavy monolithic blows to the head, their music results in a promising and unique sound that can only be grasped as dark and utterly bleak.

'The debut album of a Belgian band Grown Below “The Long Now” presents another approach to mixture of such genres as post rock and sludge metal. The band succeeded to find their unique composition and sound. “The Long Now” will surely be appreciated by fans of such bands as Isis, Mouth Of The Architect and, especially, Cult Of Luna. The CD comes as a limited edition digipack with a booklet.' (Slow Burn Records)
