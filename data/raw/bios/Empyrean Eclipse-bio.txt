Empyrean Eclipse was started in the spring of 2004 by Ryan, Roger, and Steve. We had no clue we would end up where we are now. With a small but growing fan base. We have played with many local and national acts. From Flotsam and Jetsam and Jag Panzer to local acts like The Mandrake, Dethroned, Silencer, and Corruption. We are currently finishing up our debut album that is self financed and will continue to move our style into uncharted areas for us. Check back soon as we will have the new material up on the site. If you would like to get a copy of the demo or the album, email us at empyreanforever@yahoo.com.
