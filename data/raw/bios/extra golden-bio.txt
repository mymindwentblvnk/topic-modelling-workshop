In Extra Golden continents meld when Alex Minoff and Ian Eagleson of Golden collaborate with Otieno Jagwasi of Extra Solar Africa, a Nairobi based group.  Onyango Wuod Omari rounds out the lineup playing drums on four tracks. The rhythm-beat, acid-blues rock of Golden meets Benga, a guitar heavy dance music based in Nairobi.  The April 2004 collaboration proves fruitful on this six song L.P. that twists Benga forms with fuzzy guitars and minor chords.  Sadly, Otieno Jagwasi passed away in May 2005 due to liver failure complicated by H.I.V.  "Ok-oyot" is a saying of the Luo people, meaning "It's not easy." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Extra+Golden">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
