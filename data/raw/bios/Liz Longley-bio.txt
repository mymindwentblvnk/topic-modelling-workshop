Liz Longley (born in Downingtown, PA) is an American singer and songwriter. She is currently based in Nashville, TN.

 Since her graduation from Boston’s renowned Berklee College of Music, Longley has assembled quite an impressive resume.  While best known for her stop-you-in-your-tracks voice, Longley has quickly built a reputation as an accomplished songwriter, crafting intimately personal portraits through her music. Longley's ever-expanding fan base is not the only group to acknowledge her talent.  In 2010 alone, Longley took home top prizes at some of the most prestigious songwriting competitions in the country; the BMI John Lennon Songwriting Scholarship Competition, the International Acoustic Music Awards and the Chris Austn Songwriting Contest.
 
While she has previously opened shows for established artists such as Mindy Smith, Nanci Griffith, Paula Cole, Livingston Taylor, Amos Lee, Shawn Colvin, Colin Hay and America, it is becoming clear that Longley has come into her own as a performer.  The Washington Post declared that she is “destined to a bigger audience,” Dig Boston called her “a rising acoustic sensation” and even John Mayer is a fan, calling her music “gorgeous, just gorgeous.”  Executives at Sirius XM caught wind of her cover of Van Morrison’s hit “Moondance” and added it into regular rotation, along with her award-winning original song, “When You’ve Got Trouble.”  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Liz+Longley">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
