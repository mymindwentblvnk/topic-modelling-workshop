The summer of 2014 was unbearably hot in Helsinki. It quickly became apparent to us that the only way to survive this tropical heat wave in the North was to escape into the pitch-black night of our hideout lit by a single strobe light and armed with enough amplifying power to blast the sun into oblivion. We thus descended underground to create a winter of minds cold enough to soothe our heat-struck souls and bear what was left of the warmth before being surrounded by the comforting cold darkness again.

When the icy wind finally blew across this northern land of ours, we decided it was time to share our secrets. It seemed as if we were able to collectively tap into the darkest energies of our subconsciousness and they were flowing out of us as waves of sound without any filtering. So we locked ourselves into our hideout and channelled this energy in an intensive session that was as scary as it was fruitful. We played everything together on the spot and refrained from any edits or overdubs to keep that energy intact. The results of this session have now reached the form of our self-titled debut EP.

The members in our band are also working with [ HANDLINGNOISE ], [ Manfish ], [ Asfaltti-JÃ¤rviset ], [ J.Kiesi Grandes ] etc, but what we are doing here does not bare much resemblance to those other projects. We started from a clean slate for this one. Or to be more precise, a cold, dark, metallic slate, which in the end turned out to be quite dirty.

MEMBERS:

Anssi Soininen (Drums),
Antti Sundberg (Guitar),
Miika Tams (Bass guitar / Backing vocals),
Valtteri Virolainen (Guitar / Vocals / Recording / Mixing).

When we first met in the summer of 2014, we had no idea what we were in for. It seemed as if we were able to collectively tap into the darkest energies of our subconsciousness and they were flowing out of us as waves of sound without any filtering. So we locked ourselves into our hideout and channelled this energy in an intensive session that was as scary as it was fruitful. We played everything together on the spot and refrained from any edits or overdubs to keep that energy intact. The results of this session are now upon you in the form of this EP. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hundred+Headless+Horsemen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
