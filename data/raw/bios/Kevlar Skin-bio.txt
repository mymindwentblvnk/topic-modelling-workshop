Kevlar Skin inception dates back to 1998. Starting as a standard Death Metal band, the music slowly evolved into a more brutal approach, taking elements from american Brutal Death, Grind and some Hardcore elements. Their first opus was Synthetic God, a self-released demo recorded in late 2000 that was heavily distributed in the underground. Although they didnÂ´t altogether like this stuff, it was their only recorded work, so they worked hard in promoting it, sending more than 500 copies to zines/distros/labels/people all over the globe. In 2002 they recorded Zero Consciousness, a promo CD that would be featured a year later as a split CD with Velocidad Absurda. A year later another split CD was released, this time with australian one-man band Virus. Their latest stuff is a MCD called The Bereaved, released in June 06 by Life Fluid Prods. During all those years the band has played everywhere with bands such as Pungent Stench, Scarve, Godless Truth, Wormed, Infected Malignity, Human Mincer, Avulsed, Synapsick, Arkhon Infaustus, Fermento and many more...
Recently, the band entered studio to record a cover version of spanish grind/death act Ruido de Rabia to be released in a tribute in early 07. As of now they are writing stuff for their first full lenght, to be recorded next year, and looking for a label to release it... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kevlar+Skin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
