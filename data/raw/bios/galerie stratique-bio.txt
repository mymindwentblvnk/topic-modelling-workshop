Best known for atmospheric electronic music, Galerie Stratique (Charles-Émile Beullac) first appeared on a Worm Interface compilation. In 2001 he released the cold and misty Nothing Down-to-Earth, followed by the warmer and psychedelic Horizzzons. From 2004 he moved in a new direction while conceiving a strange semi-acoustic album entitled Faux World. Galerie Stratique explores ethereal territories in a wide range of styles. Beullac currently lives in Québec, Canada. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Galerie+Stratique">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
