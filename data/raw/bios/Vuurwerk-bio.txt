Vuurwerk is dutch for Fireworks and thatâ€™s probably the most there is to say at the moment.

Vuurwerk is part of Run Tell Secrecy, the Brussels based mystery crew behind other bands as Jealov (Mush Records) and Kwatsa.

Their debut LP "ME+ONE" (the culmination of the ME, PLUS and ONE EPs) contains an aura of tunes, repetitive loops and samples, sped-up vocals mixed up with voices at half speed that give it a slight angelic and definitely sexy feel. Supported by Boiler Room UK and XLR8R these guys hold promise for their dubby approach on emotional dance music. 

Influences: Mount Kimbie, Burial, Clams Casino.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vuurwerk">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
