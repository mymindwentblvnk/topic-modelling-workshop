1. supercell is a Japanese 11-member music group led by songwriter ryo. They initially formed in 2007 as a doujin music group with ryo as the sole member. They began their venture by making use of the 初音ミク (Hatsune Miku) vocaloid singing synthesizer to produce vocals for songs submitted to the Nico Nico Douga video sharing website. Among the songs they have submitted to the website, the song メルト (Melt), which has views numbering in millions, has piqued the interest of an illustrator named 119 (pronounced Hikeshi) who would later be the second member of supercell. 119 is currently an inactive member.

In August 2008 at the 74th Comiket convention, they released their self-titled album, supercell, containing their most popular hits in addition to previously unreleased songs. On March 4, 2009, they made their major debut after releasing the same album under Sony Music Entertainment Japan, the labeled release included a DVD with music videos in addition to more tracks.

In 2009, they made a transition from Hatsune Miku to having やなぎなぎ (Nagi Yanagi), whose singing talent ryo discovered through her uploads on Nico Nico Douga, as their guest vocalist. The collaboration produced 3 singles starting with "君の知らない物語". The album's self-titled track was used as the ending theme to the anime Bakemonogatari and was also included on the anime's soundtrack album (化物語 音楽全集 Songs & Soundtracks). The second track, "LOVE & ROLL", was used as the ending theme to the movie Cencoroll. 

The second single, "さよならメモリーズ" (Sayonara Memories), was released on February 10, 2010, it included a music video for the self-titled track. The last single, "うたかた花火 / 星が瞬くこんな夜に" (Utakata Hanabi / Hoshi ga Matataku Konna Yoru Ni), was released on August 25, 2010. "Utakata Hanabi" was used as the 14th ending theme for the anime Naruto: Shippuden while "Hoshi ga Matataku Konna Yoru ni" was used as the ending theme for the visual novel Mahoutsukai no Yoru. 

On March 16, 2011, they released their second studio album Today Is a Beautiful Day, which was their only album featuring Nagi as the vocals. The album included all of the major recordings from the 3 singles in addition to new tracks. The album's name was partly inspired by the film 告白 (Kokuhaku) and its theme song Last Flowers featured on a special release of the Radiohead album, In Rainbows, ryo found the song as melancholic and impressive with regards to its 'life is wonderful' theme. He composed the songs with the conception of starting and ending with "君の知らない物語" (translating to 'The story you don't know') which was reflected on the first and last tracks of the album ("終わりへ向かう始まりの歌" and "私へ" respectively) as they shared the melody of the song but with different lyrics. 

After Nagi’s departure, the band held auditions for a guest vocalist on their third album. Out of the 2000 applicants, two girls were chosen, 15-year-old Koeda and 17-year-old Chelly. Both of them sang the music themes for the 2011 anime Guilty Crown, and released their first singles on the same year. The themes from Guilty Crown sung by Koeda are released under EGOIST (the fictional band from the anime).

In 2013, the band released the album Zigaexperientia, with Koeda on vocals.

2. Supercell Project aka DJ Supercell is Beat Fehlmann, born 10 Oct 1984, living in Olten(SO), Switzerland He started his musical career at the age of 11 with taking Keyboard-Lessons and playing Music at several School Parties. At the Keyboard-Lessons and at the little homestudio of a friend were the first self-made tracks born. The fascination in electronic music tools, the love to all kind of electronic music and growing up in the trance-scene has made him to a real sound-freak. In the year 1999, he got infected by the psychedelic trance music-scene and until today he spent a lot of time in this with organise parties, deejaying and of course creating psychedelic trance music. In 2006, with the new studio, he started the SUPERCELL PROJECT, in which he puts all the earned know-how last years live on stage and in the studio. The result is a higher quality production and a diversified live show.
