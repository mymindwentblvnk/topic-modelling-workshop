Napolian aka Ian Christian Evans (June 8, 1992 - June 29, 2021)  was an electronic musician and producer. He attended Taft High School, the alumni of which includes Ice Cube and Eazy-E. Whilst the stylistic legacy of gangster rap runs deep in Napolian’s music, the armature is that of a young producer writing his own tale without historical precedents. His debut album "Incursio" was released on Oneohtrix Point Never's label Software.  In 2013, Napolian had production credits on A$AP Ferg’s Trap Lord and Kelela’s Cut 4 Me. Following his 2011 split release with Computer Dreams and his 2012 EP Rejoice, his debut full-length Incursio was released on Software in 2014. The next year, he released a collaborative album with Airbird (aka Joel Ford) called Mr. Foolish. In 2019, Napolian featured on Yves Tumor’s song “Applaud.” Evans passed away at age 29  June 29, 2021.
