Biography
Beginning in February 2007, these six musicians got together to unite their progressive rock and hardcore metal influences into the mixture known today as The Mirage Theory. The band is composed of drummer Davier Perez, guitarists César Adames and Giovanni Melendez, keyboardist Jon Viguié, bassist Daniel Rodriguez and Jan Michael Vega on vocals. Since their inception, they have worked incessantly to expand their reach among crowds from almost every genre and style by letting their eclectic influences flow through their instruments, thus creating the type of heavy music that can reach beyond the mosh pit.

Aside from showcasing their talents locally for international acts such as August Burns Red, Job For A Cowboy, Dark Tranquillity, among others, the boys from TMT have also taken their art stateside, playing highly-acclaimed shows across Florida and Georgia, and on February 2014, they will embark on a North American Tour (including Canada and Mexico) with Tampa-based bands The Absence and From The Embrace.

On February 22nd, 2014, The Mirage Theory independently released their first EP, "Origins", as a digital download through Bandcamp (miragetheory.bandcamp.com). Its two singles, "Too Many Dreams", and "The Dying & The Dead" have had music videos filmed which can be viewed through the official youtube channel: youtube.com/themiragetheory.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Mirage+Theory">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
