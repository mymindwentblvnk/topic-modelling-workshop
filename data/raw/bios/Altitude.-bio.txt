A multi-instrumentalist and producer originally hailing from Seattle, Washington; Charles Feig (aka Altitude.) makes ambient hip hop-influenced electronic music. He began producing computer-based music at the age of 12, and began to gain recognition online around 2015 with the release of three unofficial beat tapes in the space of 2 years. With a sound rooted in samples and gritty un-quantized drums, he became one of the most recognized artists in the fast growing genre of Lofi HipHop. After releasing a full length album in 2016 entitled "always expanding" and a compilation album entitled "odds and ends" in 2017, Feig began work on a new project that would eventually become the KNIGHT EP, his most recent released work and the first release on which he explores a new and different sound, one that features more live instrumentation, sweeping cinematic and atmospheric textures, and less reliance on samples. KNIGHT was released in January 2019 via Inner Ocean Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Altitude.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
