"Originally formed in 1991 and having gone through many line-up changes before disbanding in 1999 Blessed Sickness is Vince Smithhisler, Roy Stewart, and Dave Phillips. Since reforming in mid-2007 Sickness has become a live show machine. Playing shows throughout NE Ohio, each one better than the last. We look forward to melting your face off soon!! Look for a studio release featuring new material along with a couple of favorites coming mid to late summer of '08. We will keep you posted..."
