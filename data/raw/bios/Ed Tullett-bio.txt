Born in Oxford (October 1993), Ed Tullett began composing music at a young age upon moving close to Brighton.

Tullett's new record Fianc√©, which he considers his true debut, is out now on Monotreme Records. On it, Tullett showcases his own natural progression from the influences of modern melodic folk, alternative R&B, and dream pop elements.

Other ongoing projects include working on a full-length release in collaboration with burgeoning alt-folk artist Novo Amor, with love for their first single "Faux" reaching from NPR to BBC Radio 1 and placements in Bones and Pretty Little Liars. Their new collaborative single 'Alps' was released in April 2016 to similar acclaim
