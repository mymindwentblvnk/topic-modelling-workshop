The band was formed in March 2006. Bart, Tom and Stip already knew each other from popcentre 013 and from the metalscene in Tilburg, they had talked for a while about forming a brutal band but a drummer was missing then. 
In March Tom contacted a drummer who he knew from a few years back. After two rehearsels, Yuma and Tom were confident that Bart and Stip would like the idea of what they were doing riffwise and asked them to join the band. They were full of enthousiasm and a month later Bart came up with the name of this new formation and THE NEW DOMINION was born.
