Rain of Acid was formed in the year 2008 in Vaasa Finland by experienced musicians. Originally the plan was to make a come back with a former band, All in me, that has a long history in the Finnish underground metal scene during the years 1999-2006. Esa is the only original member from All in me, so a new name seemed in order. A demo/single was made in 2009 and in just a couple of weeks the first batch of 300 singles was sold out. The songs have been made during a long time period, carefully polished to perfection, so that no half made songs have made the cut. A few live gigs have been played during 2009 and the response has been more than positive. We describe our music as Death/Dark metal. Esa gave up his guitar playing and is focusing solely on the vocals since April 2009 and thatâ€™s also when a new band member, Jussi Virtanen, joined the group as its new guitarist.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rain+Of+Acid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
