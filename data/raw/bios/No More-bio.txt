From early No-Wave to Dark/Gothic Underground, from EBM via Techno to Electroclash - and back again! This is NO MORE!

    In 1981, the German band landed the underground hit-single SUICIDE COMMANDO, which spread internationally like a virus regardless of genre and scene.

    Whether in New York's Limelight, at the Love Parade in Berlin or on the soundtrack to the graffiti train writers movie "Dirty Handz": SUICIDE COMMANDO was played everywhere and reached a status that made the title feasible for prominent remixers. Thanks DJ Hell or Echopark, SUICIDE COMMANDO is still happening today as it was 25 years ago.

    After a long, long break NO MORE (condensed in the duo Tina Sanudakura and Andy Schwarz) got back on stage in fall 2008 - with a strong set of old and new songs.

    They played all over Europe in cities like Antwerp, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Athens, Warsaw, Milano, Rome, Paris, Rotterdam, Hamburg, Munich, Berlin and at the famous M'era Luna Festival.
    One was again reminded of the early NME quote in 1982: "young Germans who appear to have fallen out of Lou Reed's Berlin album".
    Or let's just call it: Post-Punk-Electronica-Kraut-Glam-Pop.

    No More is now signed to Rent A Dog.
    A new album will be released in March 2010, while this here is their brandnew single “Sunday Mitternacht / A Rose Is A Rose”.

    NO MORE's first release on their new label Rent A Dog is a double-A-sided single called “Sunday Mitternacht / A Rose Is A Rose” (Coloured Vinyl/ Download).
    "Sunday Mitternacht", a dark surrealistic clubnumber, they composed together with Echopark-producer Torsten Stenzel.
    "A Rose Is A Rose" was supposed to be the title track of their 1982 EP. Finally this hypnotic track shines brightly in its new 2010 version.

    The new 7"-vinyl-single "Sunday Mitternacht" (green-coloured-vinyl) will be released on 15th of January 2010.

There are a few artists under the same name:

1) No More were post-punk/new wave band from Kiel, Germany. They formed in 1979  as a new wave band but during the 80's decided to change their style into a mixture of darkwave with oriental elements.

They toured Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands and developed a performance that was much wilder and rougher than on their recordings.

No More decided to go separate ways in 1986, shortly after finishing their LP Hysteria.
 
2) No More is also a Finnish heavy metal band which will rock your world sooner or later. These pages tells more about us... (http://www.no-more.cjb.net/) but at the present time sites are in progress. Keep an eye on and soon you will see more.

3) No More is also a punk rock band originally from Port Charlotte Florida in 1994, relocated to Gainesville Florida in 1997.  They have released numerous records and extensively toured the United States several times. 

4) Band of dalmatian students from Split (at studies in Zagreb, Croatia) 
 whose sole purpose is to promote mediterannean style of life (take it eeeeeaaaaasyyyyyyy. Period) 
At the moment, they are recording their debut material, promoted by a hit single "Zagreb".  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/No+More">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
