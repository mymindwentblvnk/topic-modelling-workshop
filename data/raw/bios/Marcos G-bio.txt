marcos g is a singer/songwriter from Miami Florida. Growing up part-Colombian/part-Nicaraguan in Miami led to Marcos developing an eclectic range of influences sonically; from many Latin Influences, to RnB to dance-pop. In Marcos’ music, we hear him take a unique spin on all of these sounds, in turn creating his own genre: G-pop. A buzzing talent, Marcos’ abilities are methodically being introduced to the world and he has no plans on stopping short of global stardom, but on his time. His do-it-yourself approach oozes through his easy-going tunes, and his personality matches the energy his music brings. His listeners are an ever growing family in good vibes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/marcos+g">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
