Six years back, in summer of 2001, I started out with the first line up for the band: two guitars, a voice and a violin became the first Rain Dogs (Paul Van Lanie, Guitar - Leen Cleuren, violin and backing vocals). The very first concert? A support act for Kevin Coyne... one great experience but a lot of stress preceded it!! After touring small clubs like ' 't Ey', 'Ten Weyngaert', 'toogenblik',... we started recording our first demo in 2003. Eventually the Nightwaves EP was finished in january 2004. While recording the demo, I ran out of luck. After working together for three years the band split up...

New musicians came and the band was restyled entirely. But again... good things don't last forever, the result was an inevitable split!?! My good friend Eugene Ruffolo told me: "The lonely Rain Dog remains..." Armed with my voice and guitar, I started performing solo... The culmination? Playing at the premiere of Patrick Ferryn's docudrama "I was Born in Portland Town", a docudrama about the legendary banjo picker Derroll Adams. Currently I've doing a lot of rewriting, and have just planned to start recording a solo debut album later this year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/RaiNdOg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
