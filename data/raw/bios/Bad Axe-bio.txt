There were two Bad Axes:

1. Bad Axe were a Californian hard rock band of the 1970s featuring future Vinnie Vincent Invasion & Slaughter bassist Dana Strum. Just five copies of their 1976 debut were pressed, of which only one still exists. A reissue was limited to 500 copies. They also released the 'Cry For Me' 7" in 1977.

2. The other Bad Axe self-released an album titled 'Contradiction to the Rule' in 1986.

3. The original Bad Axe formed in Chicago circa 1971 and 2 cuts, 'Poorman Run' and 'Coachman' ( recorded in 1973) recently released on Permanent Records.
