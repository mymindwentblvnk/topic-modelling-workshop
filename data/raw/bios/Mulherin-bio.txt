MULHERIN are Marshall and Parker Mulherin, an R&B duo and identical twin brothers from Memphis, TN. They produce, write, and sing. The pair started playing drums at a very young age and began producing beats and writing songs while studying at Loyola University in New Orleans.

Their self-released songs are now available online, receiving noted press, a prized place amongst Red Bull Music Academy’s impressive roster of student alumi, and an ever-growing fan base.
