Circle of Ouroborus is an experimental black metal band from Finland, formed by Antti Klemi and Rauta in 2004. The band's sound is characterized by lo-fi production, unusual use of clean vocals and sometimes entirely acoustic releases that have very little in common with black metal. Sadness and nature themes seem to be prevalent in their music. While particular influences on their work seem unclear there seems to be an obvious influence of Joy Division, as they covered this band's classic "She's Lost Control" on their debut album. They've released numerous demos and full-length albums, as well as splits with Urfaust, Nuit Noire, Cosmic Church, Drowning the Light, Crooked Necks, Roman Cross and numerous others. Their impressive discography keeps on growing with new releases, displaying a wide variety of styles and influences, but keeping a very distinct and recognizable own sound.

The Ouroboros is an ancient symbol that depicts a serpent swallowing its own tail and forming a circle. It has been used to represent many things, but it most generally symbolizes the ideas of cyclic existence or infinity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Circle+of+Ouroborus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
