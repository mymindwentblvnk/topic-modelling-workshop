The Portland heavy metal power trio AVI DEI was formed early in the new year of 2011.  Taking a less standard route in the metal scene, AVI DEI focused it's attention on writing songs with an uplifting nature.  Not focusing on the darkness of this world, but focusing on transcending that darkness.  I know that doesn't sound very metal, but what's more blasphemous than claiming God to be The Demiurge, the cause of that darkness; and it being the goal of mankind to overpower that force?  So with lyrics steeped in Gnostic Mysticism & The Occult, and music heavily influenced by the pioneers of metal, AVI DEI played their first show in the spring of 2011.  A nonstop force ever since, this band has set out to bring the power back to the people, and won't stop until The Demiurge is destroyed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Avi+Dei">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
