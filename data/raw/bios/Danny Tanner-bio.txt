Danny Tanner are a grindcore duo from Roselle Park, New Jersey, formed around 2005.  They place fast-paced grindcore which, at times, has melodic elements and copious use of television and movie samples.  While they play fast, they are not quite up to the speed of powerviolence.

They have recorded and engineered many of their albums themselves, with distribution through Manicidic Records, a local New Jersey grindcore/death metal label.  The lyrical content of their songs is mostly political when it's not trying to be comical, showing the band has a strong connection to political dissidence.  Many of the songs from their 3 song EP were reworked and added to their full length EP The Finest Grind.  They have appeared on a number of compilation albums with acts such as Semen Across Lips, Repugnant Stench, and Dr. Satan

Their newest album The Never Ending Process is due to be released in 2010 by Manicidic Records.
