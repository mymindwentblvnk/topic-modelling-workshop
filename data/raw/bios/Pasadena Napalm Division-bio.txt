What do you get when you cross a Dirty Rotten Imbecile with 3 Dead horses and throw in bit of Verbal Abuse? You get a Thrash Metal juggernaut that goes by the name of PASADENA NAPALM DIVISION. Trademark vocals from longtime D.R.I. front man Kurt Brecht set over the monstrous guitars of DEAD HORSE'S Greg Martin & Scott Sevall, and a twisted trashing backbeat provided by DEAD HORSE drummer Ronnie Guyote and VERBAL ABUSE bassist Bubba Dennis II. 5 seasoned veterans that have been there and done that and are ready to do it again.
Their debut release "P.N.D. EP" is a perfect display of alcohol driven, fist-pumping, pit skanking cult thrash metal. Featuring song titles such as "Spell It Out", "100 Beers With A Zombie" and "Failure", the EP was released in September 2010 to unleash hell upon the unsuspecting underground through Abyss Records.
