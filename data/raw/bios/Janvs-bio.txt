JANVS was born in 2003 as a solo project of Vinctor; after recording some advanced material, the project signs an agreement with Pagan Moon Records for the release of the debut album, at the beginning conceived as a demo, "Nigredo" (PGM-008, 2004), in a limited edition and with a special package.

In spite of the very low number of copies available and the lo-fi quality of the recording, the record receives a surprising feedback from the italian underground and very good reviews. The critics compared this first release to an album such as "Filosofem" but they underlined a strong compositive personality and a remarkable musical and conceptual research behind it.

In 2005 Malphas (Tronus Abyss, Offizial Propagande) as bass player and Francesco La Rosa (Ianva, Malombra, Segno del Comando) as drums player join the band whereas Vinctor keeps handling vocals and guitars.

The new album is finally ready and it proposes a wide change in style and a great improvement in quality standards. It is called FVLGVRES and it is made up of 7 tracks for more than 40 minutes of music.

Conceptually the album is based upon the shattering of human limits and condition, upon the longing and the temporary conquest of real moments of awareness and contact with the peaks of trascendence. As already stated musically expect something intense, aggressive, melancholic, solemn.

There is also a Song called "Pietas I" on a Sampler called "B.M.I.A. Compilation". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Janvs">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
