Jackson and his Computer Band is an IDM artist signed to Warp Records consisting of Parisian composer Jackson Fourgeaud

Jackson Fourgeaud began making music at the age of 15, intrigued by some of the pioneers of music and the equipment they used. After his acid house debut on Pumpking records in 1996, Sound Of Barclay released the "Sense Juice" and "Gourmet" EPs, under the name Jackson & His Computer Band. Jackson was commissioned to remix an array of artists including Femi Kuti, Air, Vanessa Paradis, Luke Vibert, Freeform Five and Jean Jacques Perrey.

Jackson Fourgeaud rose to prominence in 2003 with his 'Utopia EP'. The title track "Utopia", features vocals by his mother, Paula Moore, a folk and blues singer. Jackson's radical remix of M83's "Run Into Flowers", later the stand-out tune on Michael Mayer's Fabric 13 DJ mix, proved this unique artist's mettle and crossover appeal.

Warp picked up on these records and released his debut album 'Smash' on September 19, 2005
