Hellhaim (stylized HELLHAIM) is a heavy metal band founded in 2008 in Warsaw (Poland) by two guitarists, Albert "Al" Żółtowski and Piotr "Schenker" Konicki, who had played with each other in the metal band Alioth almost 20 years before. Along with Piotr's son, Michał "Crossfire" Konicki, they became the band's core for many years. After addition of Piotr "Omel" Omelańczuk (bass) and Mariusz "Joker" Garwoliński (vocals) in 2011, the band played numerous concerts in and near Warsaw. Joker left the band by the end of 2012.
2013 marks Mateusz "Matt" Drzewicz taking over vocal duties and in the next few years Hellhaim toured extensively and released 2 records - an EP "In the Dead of the Night" in 2015 and full-length debut album "Slaves of Apocalypse" in 2017.
By the end of 2016 Crossfire left the band for personal reasons and was replaced by Jarosław "Jaro" Kaczmarczyk (ex-Dark Ride).

Hellhaim's music is the take on classic 80's heavy metal with elements characteristic for other metal genres, most notably thrash metal, death metal and avant-garde metal.
