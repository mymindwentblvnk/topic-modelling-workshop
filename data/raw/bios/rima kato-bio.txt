Rima Kato started ‘Strrows’ in 1996, which as a lo-fi girls duo. They release some CDs before they broke up in 2001. Soon 'Strrows' disappeared from the music scene. 

Rima Kato had continued to compose in the past ten years, recently releasing her first solo album, called 'Faintly Lit'. Her music stands out by such a simple arrangement with sense of melancholy and transparency. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/rima+kato">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
