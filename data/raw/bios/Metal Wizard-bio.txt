Metal Wizard is Hugo Aguiar from Lisbon (Portugal). He plays a very unique & powerful fusion of Goa, Dark, Full-On................and Metal!!!
With a live act ideal to play early morning, it creates the perfect connection between Dark psy and Full-On.
He started studying at a music school in his early teens, with guitar as the main instrument. Hugo later joined a metal band were he evolved as a guitar player, and since then metal became part of his life.
Psychedelic trance appeared in 96, when he went to his first party, and what a party…. it was a through life changing experience, surely to be repeated!
The interest for electronic music production started in 2003, shortly after Hugo went to live in the UK, were he finished an MSc in Music Engineering and Production.
After travelling and playing in Australia for 2 years, he is currently back to Portugal creating and manipulating exciting new “spells”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Metal+Wizard">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
