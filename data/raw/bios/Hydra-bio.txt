* 11) Combine whiskey-soaked vocals with the open road, add in years of punk influence and in a trice, The Hydra is born. The Hydra is a folk-punk band from Los Angeles, Ca. This unique band consists of four musicians from Florida who have been working together for nearly a decade. Reunited in Los Angeles, they pursue their passions with vigor. Having lead vocals shared by Xtian and Wolfy, The Hydra has a combination of raspy and soothing sounds that lay the perfect soundtrack to drive the back roads of their swampy, and space program littered home state. Years of touring together in prior bands have made for a solid friendship, which is easily recognized by their chemistry on and off stage. The Hydra is driven by their mutual love of playing and traveling alongside friends and family. Artists such as Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Cure, Murder by Death, The Pixies, The Dead Milkmen, and fellow Florida friend, Chuck Ragan, heavily influence the band’s new self-titled EP. The Hydra goes against the grain when it comes to musicianship by blending an intelligent mixture of country vibes and punk-rock roots. The songs, written about heart-break, booze, and growing up in the deep south, are raw and come from the heart.
