Black Bart has been many things in life, yet music has always been his calling.  After many adventures, trials and tribulations, Black Bart decided to finally listen to the Universe.

In June 2014, Black Bart released his Debut EP BLACK BART, and hasnâ€™t looked back.

In 6 weeks Black Bart has climbed  into the top 25 Artists in Hip Hop for Denver CO (per REVERBNATION)

An excessively eclectic person, his music reflects this with a wide ranging sound that blends hip hop, electronic, trap, funk, reggae and sometimes a nice dose of humor as well.
