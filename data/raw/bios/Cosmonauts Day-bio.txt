Cosmonauts Day is an instrumental atmospheric post-metal, post-rock and sludge music, "the inner and outer space" inspired band from Moscow, Russian Federation, formed in 2010.

"From the depths of Russian underground scene comes absolutely epic spaced out sludge outfit. Intense guitar riffing, crushing to the ground and below drum stabbing, wicked bass, dreamy solos and an atmoshere of a cold space - their music is a mind journey to the places you've never known."
