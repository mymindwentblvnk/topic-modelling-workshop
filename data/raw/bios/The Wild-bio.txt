The Wild is a Folk Punk band from Atlanta, Georgia.

From their label: http://www.quoteunquoterecords.com/qur028.htm

The Wild are a lot of things. They are a long sunny drive on an empty interstate. They're a hot summer night, drinking beers and barbecuing on your porch. With its jangly guitars and rolling narratives, The Wild's debut EP is perfect for those warmer months of the year. And not only is the music awesome, but The Wild also help run The Wonderroot, which is a community center in Atlanta that provides a low-cost/free recording studio, darkroom, computer lab, library, conference room for the local kids as well as an all-ages show space for tons of bands passing through, something Atlanta hasn't had in a while.
