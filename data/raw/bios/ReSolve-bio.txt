There is more than one band named Resolve:

1. Resolve is a metalcore band from Lyon, France. They are currently signed to Arising Empire.

2. "Resolve is a five-piece straight edge band from the St. Louis, MO-area, that plays pure late 1980s youthcrew hardcore, in the classic style that bands like Youth Of Today and Turning Point made big. So the perfect soundtrack to singalong, fingerpoint and jump around to! The songs are fast, energetic full of catchy singalongs and deal with life from a positive perspective. With lyrics about the meat industry, the power of oil corporations in the USA, intelligent design, but also about being different and making a positive change, Resolve makes clear that the have some importants thoughts to share."
- Commitment Records

3. "Resolve are from Minneapolis and feature State of Fear guitarist Bracken, Skell from Scorned, and Saira from Detestation on vocals. Saira's vocals make for obvious comparisons to Detestation, but musically they are much more raw, heavy, and brutal."
