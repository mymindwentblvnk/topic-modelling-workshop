Memorain is a speed/thrash metal band from Greece, formed by guitarist/vocalist Ilias Papadakis in 1999. After a few line up changes in 2001 the band recorded their first demo CD titled "Until You Die". Drawing influence mainly from the American Heavy/Thrash scene, the Memorain guys contributed a song for the "Voices Of Death Part 5" compilation album and a few months later they paid tribute to one of their favorite bands, Megadeth, recording a cover version of the song "Disconnect" for the album "Droogie - A Megadeth Tribute".

In August 2002, the band signed a two-record deal with local label NMC Music and their first album "Digital Crimes" was released a couple of months later. In 2003, Memorain released their second album "White Line", featuring the legendary guitarist James Murphy (Testament, Obituary, Death, etc). The band also contributed songs to numerous compilation albums. In September 2003, the band composed the music theme for Greece's premier metal TV show, "TV War", a TV show supported by the Greek Metal Hammer Magazine. In September 2005, Memorain signed an exclusive contract with EMI Greece and two months later the band started recording their new album "Reduced To Ashes" with Nick Menza (ex-Megadeth) on drums and Jeff Waters (Annihilator), as a special guest. Recorded partially in Los Angeles-California "Reduced To Ashes" was released by EMI Greece in 17th, April 2006.
