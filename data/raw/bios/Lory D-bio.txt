Lorenzo D'Angelo, better known as Lory D is a name you will find missing from the list of celebrated dark techno producers, e.g. Jeff Mills, The Mover, Lenny Dee and the Aphex Twin, although his music is as essential. 

He is an ex-Italian D.M.C. champion who has been playing since 1989 and owns the seminal Roman techno label Sounds Never Seen. He was one of the first people to bring the Acid House and Hardcore sounds of London to Rome, where he is regarded as something of a god. His inspiration comes from Rome's nighttime metropolis, the darkness and beauty of the city and the overwhelming feeling of the underground raves he plays. His musical influences are as wide ranging as Aphex Twin, Suicide, Drexciya, Spk, Ligeti, Frankie Bones, The Mover and Underground Resistance. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lory+D">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
