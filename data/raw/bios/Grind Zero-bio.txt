GRIND ZERO is a Death Metal band from Northern Italy formed near Milan in late 2011 by guitarist Udo Usvardi and bassist Alex Colombo. The line-up was completed by guitarist Mr. D aka “Dhilorz” (Ancient), drummer Alessandro Durini and vocalist Marco Piras (Deathtopia, Funeral Rape).
In the spring of 2012 the band played their first gig having the chance to support Death Metal legends ENTOMBED during their Italian show. A few months later GRIND ZERO played with Norwegian acts DISKORD and EXECRATION in addition to several more shows around Italy.
In April 2013 the band released a three-track promo titled “FORCEFUL DISPLACEMENT” and shortly after opened for the Italian gig of POSSESSED and MALIGNANT TUMOR. After some more shows in Italy and Switzerland, the band finally entered Alpha Omega studios to record their debut album titled “MASS DISTRACTION” which came into light in July 2014 through the Danish label MIGHTY MUSIC.
In April 2015 Matteo Amighetti replaced drummer Alessandro Durini and GRIND ZERO played various concerts with the new line-up, including a four-band mini tour around Italy, and performed at the 6th edition of Hellbrigade Festival
supporting INCANTATION and DEAD CONGREGATION.
In December 2016 Matteo Amighetti and GRIND ZERO parted ways. Emanuele Prandoni was welcomed behind the drumkit as a session.
At the beginning of 2017 GRIND ZERO started recording another three-track demo of crushing Death Metal with the infamous BOSS HM-2 sound and downtuned guitars.
The 10 tracks of the upcoming second album “CONCEALED IN THE SHADOW” were completed in spring 2017 and all the tracks were recorded by Alex Colombo at “Red Pigeon Studio” near Milan during the summer except for drums which were recorded in late July at “Ex Oblivion Studio” in Oristano - Sardegna.
In the last week of October 2017 GRIND ZERO had the chance to play live supporting Swedish Thrash/Death metal gods MERCILESS and Italian veterans NECRODEATH.
The mixing of the new album was completed by Alex and mastered by Dan Swanö in December 2017 and will be published on Punishment 18 Records.
