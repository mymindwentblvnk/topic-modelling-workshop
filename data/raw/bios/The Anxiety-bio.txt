THE ANXIETY is a collaborative duo project between MSFTS MUSIC artists WILLOW, (Willow Smith) and Tyler Cole.
The project showcases the anxiety that both Willow and Tyler endure on a day to day basis and how they cope with it. “The Anxiety” sonically embodies the meaning of that personal unease, seeking to express the overwhelming feeling of a person on the brink of an attack. Their universal goal for this project is to use their voices to advocate for mental health awareness and help those who specifically suffer from anxiety. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/THE+ANXIETY">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
