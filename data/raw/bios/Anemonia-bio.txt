Epic symphonic synthetic vigorous and melodic metal for your ears and minds to be bewitched and bombarded.

Originating from an idea born in Montreal during the winter of 2003, Anemonia took many shapes and ate many fishes since then. After 4 demos, they are now going outside and are releasing their first full length album called “Moonlit Numina” the 3rd of October 2009. 

Anemonia offers extremely energetic live performances with a front woman named Cassiopée who can reach for the stars with her voice while setting the stage on fire. If you enjoy powerful interpretations of profound melodies, come be hit by the intense waves of musical passion Anemonia propels.

Love it or hate it, no one remains indifferent to the music of Anemonia.

A cruel beauty is now at large…
