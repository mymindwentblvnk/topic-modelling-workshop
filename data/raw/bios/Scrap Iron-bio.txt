Scrap Iron can be described in one word: tubular. His main influences are 80's Euro-pop and 70's gay porn soundtracks. He is also quite influential himself; his influence can be seen in contemporary Euro-pop and contemporary gay porn soundtracks. "Scrap", as he is known to his small but ever loyal fan base (consisting of his mother, a few friends and his two dogs), creates beats that make faces disintegrate and eardrums bursts. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/scrap+iron">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
