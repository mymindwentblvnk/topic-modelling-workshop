Ella Smoker, professionally know as gglum, is one of the newest young Indie artists to achieve streaming recognition. The London native grew up surrounded by music, with her Finnish and English background being the root of her diverse music taste. The then-18-year-old made her debut with “Why Don’t I Care?”, which earned her an impressive spot on Spotify’s “Fresh Finds” playlist. The song’s heavy reverbs and underlying base tones hit all the right notes of an Indie-Lofi classic. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/gglum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
