The Concubine is a deathcore band from Tabernacle, New Jersey that is known for their intricate and complex songs.The group formed in 2003, they have since toured extensively with Knife the Glitter, Left to Vanish and other, similar bands. They have a sound similar to the likes of The Black Dahlia Murder and Between the Buried and Me and are gaining recognition as one of the better up-and-coming metal bands. They have a very cool mix of old school & new school Death Metal elements. Churning, technical discordance mixed with rumble grooves, the odd arpeggio solo, deep growls and rasps deliver a competent and surprisingly brutal little record With a more chaotic and dissonant approach to their crumbling death metal influences, The Concubine like their sweeping solos and melody mired in the hefty, squealing tones. These guys can definitely hold their own with some of the great out there now. I'm sure we will be seeing a lot more from these guys as they will crush their way to the top of the new wave of Death Metal bands.

The group made their recording debut with a 2004 EP title, Maestro, If You Will. Their first full length album, Abaddon has been widely reviewed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Concubine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
