Lola Marsh is an indie folk band formed by Gil Landau and Yael Shoshana Cohen. 
The two met after studying music and they quickly began to write, record and perform together. Mati Gilad (Bass), Rami Osservaser (Guitar, Piano), Dekel Dvir (Drums) joined them shortly after. 
Their music combines deep, warm, nostalgic vocals, heart-on-the-sleeve-lyrics and Middle Eastern guitar melodies. 
Following massive performances in leading festivals and after attracting media praise, they signed with the leading indie label Anova Music. Their debut album will be released in Spring 2014 followed by performances in European summer festivals including the prestigious Pohoda festival in Slovakia and primavera sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lola+Marsh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
