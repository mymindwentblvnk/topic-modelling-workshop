John Edward Hawkins (November 1, 1969 â€“ May 1, 2006), better known as Big Hawk or H.A.W.K was a rapper from Houston, Texas and a founding member of the late DJ Screw's rap group the Screwed Up Click. He was also the older brother of Fat Pat, who was killed in 1998. Hawk, 36, was recently married and had two young sons.

Hawk released his solo album, "Under Hawk's Wings" on Dead End Records in 2000 and had recorded with Lil' Flip, Lil' Keke, Big Moe, Z-Ro and was featured on the Lil' Troy hit "Wanna Be A Baller."

He was respected in the Houston underground rap scene and appeared on numerous mixtapes from artists such as Paul Wall, Lil' Flip, Z-Ro, E.S.G., Lil' Keke and Big Pokey. After Screw's death in 2000, he was the main person responsible for keeping the S.U.C. together, so much so that his nickname was the Five Star General of the Screwed Up Click. He scored a regional hit with 2002's "U Already Know" and was recently featured on the popular single "Swang" by Trae that included a tribute to Fat Pat in 2005. His 2001 self-titled album reached No. 45 on Billboard's list of top R&B and rap albums. In 2006, Hawk, along with Clint Dempsey, aka Deuce, of the U.S. National Soccer team recorded a song for Nike's "Joga Bonito" World Cup soccer promotion called "Don't Tread". He was part of Pepsi's Yahoo! "Houston Mic Pass" with Lil' Flip, Chamillionaire, Trae, Chingo Bling, Bun B, Short Dawg, Magno and Mike D.[1] <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/H.A.W.K.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
