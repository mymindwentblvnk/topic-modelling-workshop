Rock Driven Metal 


Subjektive is a Melbourne based band formed in 2008 by New Zealand born front man / songwriter Aaron ‘AzCORE' Stevenson. After playing in successful bands such as Streign and Death Audio, Aaron has decided to step out on his own and create a more rock driven metal sound. 

To save on recording costs and to learn more about sound engineering, Aaron decided to play and record the first promotional single ‘Broken Lines' which was released in late 2008. Due to many positive reviews and feedback, Aaron decided he had to solely focus on Subjektive. 

“I felt it was time for me to play the music I felt most comfortable in” says Aaron.

In mid 2009, good friend and drummer Luke ‘MasTemA' Beltramello formerly from Inhumaine and Black Bile joined Subjektive as a collaborative partner. Luke's great musical ability and relentless motivation has helped drive Subjektive to the next level. 

Luke knew of a great guitar talent in Joel Moriss and said he would be perfect as a live session player. Joel had already heard the band and was instantly keen to join the mix.
The NEW promotional single ‘Mental' has just been released and can be heard at www.subjektive music.com. By signing up to the Subjektive's mailing list at their website, both tracks (Mental and Broken Lines) can be downloaded for free. 

Subjektive is currently recording their first E.P due out mid 2010 and are getting ready to hit the live scene with their ROCK DRIVEN METAL!
