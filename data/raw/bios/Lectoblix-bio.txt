Lectoblix is a solo project based on a series of lucid dreams chronicling the inner struggle of wanting to remain in a blissful dream state with a mixed cast of characters; both of good nature and evil intentions; and the confusion caused by longing to wake up due to the friendships and experiences awaiting the awakening return to real life. It is a story of epic adventure written in the same vain as a Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan, David Eddings, et al. series told through an original and experimental mix of atmospheric black metal, phasing guitar driven verses, depressive rock/post punk influenced choruses, and story telling style interludes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lectoblix">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
