Tattooed onto Marks left forearm reads “XVII-II-MMVI” – the date he first performed an original song in front of a large audience. Each day that tattoo staring at him is a reminder that all it takes is the courage to be yourself. At that moment, Mark remembers feeling like nothing in his life would be the same.

Diamond is from Washington state and grew up in a small town outside of Seattle called Maple Valley. He blames the rain for his style of writing. Through all of the music he writes, Mark hopes to help those similar to him, giving them a moment to quiet their busy minds, even if its just for a moment. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Diamond">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
