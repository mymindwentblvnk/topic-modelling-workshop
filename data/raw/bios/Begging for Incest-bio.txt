Begging for Incest is a slamming brutal death metal/deathcore band from Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The band was formed in 2007 by Chris (Vocals), Max (Drums, also a member of A-rise and ex-Archotype) and Jan (Guitars, formally played in Exsanguination (Deu) and ex-[Archotype).

They are influenced by bands like, Devourment, Embraced by Hatred, Despised Icon and Waking the Cadaver. They recorded a demo in late 2007 called "A Severed Head, A Better Blowjob" which got them the interest of the record label Pathologically Explicit Recordings. The record label provided a recording studio to record their debut EP titled "Awaiting The Fist" which contains, seven tracks of, brutal-guttural-slamming Death Metal, with twisting riffs, breakdowns and blasting drumbeats.
