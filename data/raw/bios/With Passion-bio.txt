With Passion are a technical/melodic death metal band. They were formed in 2002.

Their name was chosen to describe the passion with which they play their music. The band hails from Sacramento. The band was formed by Samuel Mcleod, Shaun Gier, Jeff Morgan and Jacob Peete. The band had played with numerous Metal and Hardcore acts at the time, such as Six Feet Under and As I Lay Dying. During this period they hired a session bassist to provide the bass parts. It wasn't until 2003 that the band hired a permanent bassist, Michael Nordeen. Jeff Morgan had later decided to leave the band. The band soon found a replacement in Andrew Burt. Keyboardist, Brandon Guadagnolo joined the band later on. The band released their EP "In the Midst Of Bloodied Soil" with this line up.

Jacob Pete, Andy Burt and Brandon Guadagnolo left the band after a while. Drummer Greg Donnelly and guitarist John Abernathy, both from Conducting from the Grave, joined the band in 2006. The line up consisted of four former Conducting from the Grave members. The only exception being bassist Michael Nordeen. Later that year, vocalist Shaun Gier left the band. He was replaced by Fidel Campos, just in time to begin recording their new album.

The band released their debut album In the Midst Of Bloodied Soil in 2005, the same title as their EP, through Earache Records. The album consisted of technically played melodic death metal/metalcore. The album actually consisted of the same songs on their debut EP with the addition two new tracks. The band has toured with metal heavyweights such as Immolation, Deicide, Nile and Suffocation among others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/With+Passion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
