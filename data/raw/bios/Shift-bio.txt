There are multiple artists named "Shift":
1) Swedish Power Electronics project started in 1997 by Martin Willford. Now based in the UK.

2) Shift was a New York Post-Hardcore band. They started in New York City, some time around 1990, when they were freshmen and sophmores in high school. Their initial goal was to get their friends to dance during the "mosh parts" of their songs at the high school talent show. They did and they knew they were on to something. They started to play clubs around town, and recorded a pair of demo tapes that they sold at shows. Soon they signed to Equal Vision Records and released "Pathos" in 1994 and "Spacesuit" in 1995. Next they moved to Columbia Records and put out "Get In" in 1997 before breaking up in 1998. They toured the U.S. numerous times and Europe twice. They were proud to share the stage with Quicksand, Sick Of It All, Jawbox, Rocket From the Crypt, Foo Fighters, The Offspring, Clutch, Tad, Texas Is The Reason, Shelter, Into Another, Burn, Orange 9mm, 108, Civ, Earth Crisis, The Promise Ring, NOFX, Face To Face, L7, Our Lady Peace, Supertouch, Endpoint, Avail, Killing Time, Local H, Stillsuit, Mind Over Matter and many many other great bands over the years. Samantha has gone on to play drums for Hole, Motley Crue, Eagles of Death Metal and currently, Peaches. Josh formed Big Collapse and released 2 albums. He has new project in the works. They still hear, from time to time, that they were an influential band... while other people have forgotten or maybe never knew they existed. Either way they had a lot of fun. This page was made to reconnect with old friends and fans.
