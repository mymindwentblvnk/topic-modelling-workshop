With over ten years’ experience in the music game, including three full length albums and a slew of EPs, Sweatson Klank – formerly known as Take – is one of L.A’s longest standing producers working at the periphery of hip hop and electronic music, a man who had a direct hand in shaping L.A’s beat scene in the 00s through the Sketchbook night alongside Kutmah. Whether or not you’ve heard his music before you’ll n have felt the impact of his work. After a two-year hiatus Sweatson Klank returns with the Elevate Me EP on Project Mooncircle, which was released on May 4, 2012. Elevate Me consists of five tracks that further cement him as one of the nicest and most articulate producers in the game today.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sweatson+Klank">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
