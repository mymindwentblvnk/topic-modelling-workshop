Avenie as a band has gone through such a ridiculous amount of changes, it's a small miracle it even exists anymore. For one thing, there is not a single founding member left in the band. 
I am the oldest member and even I came in about 5 years after this chaos had been conceived by some poor forlorn souls of southern Finland. Sounds kinda cool doesn't it, yeah...

Anyways, I came in circa '05 and even after that the line-up has changed entirely; I actually joined the band as a vocalist, soon ended up playing guitar as well, some people left, some were let go, when we began recording "Sombre Embrace", it was just myself and Felipe. Marko Eskola agreed to do the lead vocals and the gigs were handled with session members.

The line-up became stable a while after that and "Sombre Embrace" was published digitally in 2011, the reason for this being us getting tired of record labels and being urged to offer our music straight to the people, skip the whole indrusty in between.

We have been discussing recording our second album even this year, we'll see what happens. Buy the first one though, we need money for booze, we're both musicians and finnish.
