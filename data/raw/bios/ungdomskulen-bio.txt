Power trio from Bergen, Norway. Their music is often described as a mixture of Fugazi, Frank Zappa, King Crimson, Black Sabbath and Sonic Youth. It's noisy, it's progressive, it's funky. Debut record Cry-Baby (on label Ever Records, a satellite label of K7!/VME) was met with great reviews in the British music magazines such as UNCUT and KERRANG. Prior to their debut, the band had also self-released a trilogy of 7"s.

The bands second album, Bisexual, was released in March 2009. The cover design was created by George Underwood, who has co-operated with Gentle Giant, T-Rex, Mott the Hoople, Procol Harum and David Bowie  on several iconic covers.

Singer and guitarist Kristian Jan Erik Stockhaus is also known for his solo project Stockhaus , and has so far has released two records with the rest of the current Ungdomskulen line up - Ã˜yvind Solheim (drums) and Frode Flatland (bass) - as his backing band.

Ungdomskulen has performed a number of gigs in Norway, especially the big cities Bergen and Oslo, and has also toured Europe and the U.S., including the Roskilde Festival in Denmark and two appearances at South By Southwest in Austin, Texas.
