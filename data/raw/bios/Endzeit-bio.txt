2) Endzeit was a side project of  Axel Treusch from Astrea Redux.

They made one cd in 1990, STERNENLICHT.

3)Year 2004 , Undertaker (Keyboard) and Regnet (Lead Guitar) started playing together under the name of Inconnu. Later on joined Jordi (Rythm Guitars) needless to say that Inconnu failed to achieve any recordings or complete songs. 
In October 2004 , Dioxydo (Vocals) joined the band as well as Molok (Drums) thus changing the band's name to Endzeit. 
After several months of rehearsing and searching for a decent bassist , Metastasys joined the band in May 2005 and a month later , Endzeit's first song was recorded. 
In August 2005 , Adriana (female vocals) joined the band and completed the final line-up that Endzeit was looking for. Months later Regnet left the band due to personal and artistic differences and Metastasys took the role of lead guitarist.
