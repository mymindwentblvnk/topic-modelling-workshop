DrakariuM is a melodic power metal band from Jonqui√®re, Quebec known for their melodic passages and use of keyboards to provide atmosphere and their frequent display of outside influence including but not limited to baroque music, jazz, and Latin music (see track "Tournesol" from their 2020 album Acte II). 

DrakariuM played their first show outside of their home province of Quebec in 2016 at the Toronto Power Metal Fest event hosted at the now-defunct Coalition music venue in support of other Canadian power and prog bands Ascendia, Borealis, and Pyramid Theorem. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DrakariuM">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
