Jah Free "The dub activist". A very long history cut short. Firstly a singer and musician in a Southend, U.K. based band "Tallowah" mid 70's. Tallowah grew and became "BUSHFIRE" a very popular 8 piece band in the 80s playin their own creations. As with many bands there was conflict and Jah Free went up solo and concentrated on his own lyrics and music. Local reggae at this time was very limited  there were only local sound men/enthusiasts  who collected and played other artists music.  It was time to widen the local eye with other UK  sound systems. THE ROOTS HALL venue dubbed "The Dub Capital of  England" by KISS 100'S JOEY JAY. The fav UK reggae radio session of the time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jah+Free">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
