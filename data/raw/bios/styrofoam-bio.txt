Styrofoam (Arne Van Petegem) is a Belgian one man glitch electronica project on the independent record label Nettwerk.

In his earlier days, his composings embraced an ambient and minimal angle - which still can be heard in his later works - and were generally less song-structured. Gradually, the music of Styrofoam became more and more influenced by indietronica, indie pop and hip hop, which resulted in the album Nothing's Lost, that gave him an international recognition.

On the album Nothing's Lost, Stryofoam worked together with artists Lali Puna; Andrew Kenny (The American Analog Set); Ben Gibbard (Death Cab for Cutie, The Postal Service), Bent Van Looy (Das Pop); and Alias.
