Everyone comes from somewhere, but some people wear the cities they’re from like badges of honour. Drop the Lime is Luca Venezia, one of those people whose identity is intrinsically connected to his hometown – New York City.

And while many have only just heard of the magic of Drop The Lime, Luca has been honing his craft for years. From humble beginnings as a choirboy to a childhood obsession with 50s rock’n’roll, the 25 year old has been experimenting with sound for years via the underground electronic scene of Kid 606’s TigerBeat6 label, Mad Decent and French label Institubes (under his alter ego "Curses!").
 
Drop The Lime's influences range from Brian Eno to rockabilly (he’s well known for his 50s doo wop and soul sets) to Sonic Youth to Wu Tang but things don't just stop there. He also runs Trouble & Bass, an influential New York club night and label since 2006. The Trouble & Bass crew are the DJs who are defining a new New York sound.

“Having a crew from NYC behind you, pushing the sound you produce, is essential in creating a movement. We’re all producers and DJs so sometimes we’ll collaborate on production -- or I'll have one of them help out with one of my basslines - since they understand my sound better than anyone else”.
