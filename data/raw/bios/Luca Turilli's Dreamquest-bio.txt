Luca Turilli’s Dreamquest was a symphonic electro metal band led by Italian musician Luca Turilli, known for his work in the band Rhapsody of Fire. He created the band wanting to propose a style of modern metal combined with the genres he loved the most: pop, electronic and  symphonic music. He wrote the lyrics, composed and arranged all the music. For the first time he only presented himself as keyboard player of the band while the guitar parts were handled by Rhapsody of Fire session member Dominique Leurquin, and the same rhythm section used for Turilli’s solo band (Sascha Paeth on bass guitar and Robert Hunecke-Rizzo on drums) was hired again. The identity of Myst, the female vocalist, is still in question. Many have pointed to Bridget Fogle, who contributed to Turilli’s third album The Infinite Wonders of Creation but there is no confirmation of her identity yet.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Luca+Turilli%27s+Dreamquest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
