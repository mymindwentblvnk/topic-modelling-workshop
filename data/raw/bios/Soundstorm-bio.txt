Sound Storm was founded 2002 in Turin, a city northwest of Italy. Back in those days the band consisted of six members and played classical heavy metal songs, like Iron Maiden, Metallica, Savatage and many other bands. Sound Storm is heavily influenced by Symphonic, Epic Metal, Power Metal, Classical and Celtic Folk Music.

The bands first practical experience was gained by gigs around the local music scene in city's pubs. A first demo was recorded in 2003 and included cover versions of Manowar, Iron Maiden and Savatage.

Soon the band started composing their own material, with the first three or four tracks finished by the end of 2003. The line up of the band changed when the second guitarist Davide left the band at the beginning of 2005 and the previous bass player Saverio was replaced with Massimiliano.

Sound Storm entered the recording studio again to record their first own song "We are Vikings". For the first time the band performed at live shows with their own creations with songs like: "We are Vikings", "The Loser's Nightmare" and "Queen of the Ice". In October of 2005 the band decided to record six further songs in their own private studio, which resulted in the release of the demo, "The Storm Is Coming" including a remix of "We Are Vikings". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soundstorm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
