Featuring guitarist James McIlroy (ex-Cradle of Filth), drummer Matt C (ex-Biomechanical), guitarist paul Scanlan (ex-Akercocke) and bassist Tilman Wolff-Moore, all fused together with the vocal talents of Dave Kuchta. Combining elements from the extreme metal spectrum with melody and layered, wide-ranging vocals, the band forges together a wide array of influences, creating its own niche.

Formed in early 2006 in the aftermath of his departure from Cradle, James came up with the idea of putting together a band combining both experience and young blood with a view to writing music that would be the sum of individual's influences, rather than writing to a fixed genre or template. From this point the band spent its time writing material and finding the right member chemistry, with the band going through several line-ups before settling, in late 2007 / early 2008 with the arrival of Dave, Tilman and Matt, and culminating in the recording the 4 track "I of Goliath" EP.

Shortly after a string of live gigs and the release of the EP, former guitarist Andrew Ongley left the band and was replaced with the exceptional talents of current Skaldic Curse and former Akercocke guitarist Paul Scanlan.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chaosanct">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
