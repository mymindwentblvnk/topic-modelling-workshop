Extreme O.D. are a four piece heavy metal band from Stoke-on-Trent, UK. Currently on the verge of a 
breakthrough era, with the recent addition of the awesome talent and colossal voice of Katie Cairns; the band is galvanised & infused with the conviction to project itself brutally into the light.  

Originally formed in 2007, the band quickly made an impact on the live circuit and their music has been credibly likened to the likes of Lamb Of God, Devildriver, Pantera, Machine Head & Tool. Guitarist Kieron Berry (ex Pain Control/Razorwire) put together Extreme O.D.'s initial recording, the EP "Abomin8", using guest musicians. A full line-up was later established, with bassist Ian Deaville, drummer Brin Roberts & vocalist Mitch Russell. That line-up recorded the band's 2nd EP "This Is The End" in 2009, after which Mitch Russell departed for personal reasons, leaving the void which Katie Cairns has so forcefully filled.

Extreme O.D. has been covered in Metal Hammer, Terrorizer, Zero Tolerance and Devolution magazines. The EP title track "This Is The End" was played nationally on Kerrang Radio in November 2009. Metal Hammer's reviews editor James Gill had this to say about the band when reviewing "This Is The End".... "modern and classic" & " a great British metal band".

With Katie on board the band went through a series of successful gigs including support slots with Beholder and playing Bloodstock 2010.
