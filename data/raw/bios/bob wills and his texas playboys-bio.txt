Country band The Texas Playboys were formed in Waco, Texas by the American country musician, songwriter, and big band leader Bob Wills. They relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1934 to find a larger audience.  With their jazz sophistication, pop music and blues influence, plus improvised scats and wisecrack commentary by Wills, the band became the first superstars of the genre. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Bob+Wills+and+His+Texas+Playboys">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
