Lontalius is the project of Eddie Johnston from Wellington, New Zealand. His debut album "I'll Forget 17" was released March 2016. In October 2019 this was followed up by a second album, All I have".

Eddie began uploading hushed, forlorn covers of pop hits accompanied by an 808 and an old Casio M T-45 that a friend bought him for $2. Lontalius's buoyant take on Yung Lean's "Gatorade" found a big fan in Canadian producer/DJ Ryan Hemsworth, with Lontalius's voice gracing Hemsworth's "Walk Me Home". During 2010-2015 he often worked with Papaiti Records and recorded and performed with Taylor Groves, Miles Sutton (Tuff Wizard) and sometimes Daniel MacBride (Sheep, Dog & Wolf). "All I have" was recorded with Om'Mas Keith (producer for Frank Ocean, John Legend, Jay-Z) and Jim Fairchild (of Modest Mouse and Grandaddy).

Eddie has been making dance music as Race Banyon in parallel to Lontalius.
