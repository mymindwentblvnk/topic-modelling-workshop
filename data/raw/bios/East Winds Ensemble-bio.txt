The East Winds Ensemble was formed in New York in 1999. The enchanted sounds of the shakuhachi (flute) and the koto (semi cylindrical zither with 13 strings) are featured in an exciting program of modern and traditional music performed by members of the group Masayo Ishigure and Marco Lienhard. They have released a CD to critical acclaim and have collaborated on many other projects. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/East+Winds+Ensemble">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
