Wild Angel are a young 4-piece band (Jenson Tagg: Vocals and Guitar; Carl Taylor: Bass Guitar; Adam Roylance: Guitar and Toby Barr: Drums) from South East, London. Four talented friends got together to make something exciting, new and fresh. The result is this fantastic band! They all met in Surrey and quickly became good friends due to their appreciation for great music. 

More recently, in July/August 2006 the boys travelled to Nice in France again to play for a week. It was a very enjoyable period for the band members and a very successful week. They now have an extensive fan base, and have been asked to return during the summer of 2007. 

Wild Angel are currently busy writing and recording new material whilst frequently gigging in London. Keep an ear and an eye out for this great young band! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wild+Angel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
