Formed in 2006, Wolven Ancestry was created by founding members Fraust and Lord Defiler by recording the album "The Wrath of Gaia". A full line up was formed soon after and since this conception the band has shared the stage with many great bands including Mayhem, Sigh, Behemoth, Impaled Nazarene, Ensiferum, Rotting Christ and many more pioneering acts. 

In 2009 the second album "Silence of the Boreal" was released. The band has toured the US and Canada extensively several times and have booked all their own tours. Wolven Ancestry also recorded, produced, mastered and have released all of their own albums through their own record label, Archaic North Entertainment based out of Sudbury Ontario, Canada.

Their influences, taken from their myspace website: "The sounds of animals, mainly wolf. The sound of snow falling. The sound of the wind kissing the trees at night."
