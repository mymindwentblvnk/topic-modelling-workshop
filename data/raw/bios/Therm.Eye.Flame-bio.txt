Therm.Eye.Flame is an industrial/progressive black metal band from Sotchi, Russia. 
They consider their style as "Modernized Black Metal". Quote: "M.B.M.-is a change of classical themes, conceptions and sound of B.M. It's a musical platform consisting of dominating part of pure B.M. with microÂ¯o sprincles in the bulk of Industrial,Ambient,Noise and their products. Our music is soaked with the spirit of futurism. Urbanism,the cosmos,pain,paranoia... that is the meaning of M.B.M."

So far the band released a demo and 3 long-players, the last called "To Evolution?!" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Therm.Eye.Flame">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
