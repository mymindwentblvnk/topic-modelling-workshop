Band formed in 2008 by Shirley Pereira and Jaqueline Silva in São Paulo / SP, in order to play a different sound for the real lovers of Death and Thrash Metal scene.
The initial idea was a band formed only by girls, unfortunately it was not possible. After long search and testing, we found no drummers (women) who touched the sound of weight and agility.
This year the band was composed of Thaiz Gouveia (v), Shirley (b), Rita de Cássia(G), Jaqueline (G), Beto Shelzia (D) which stayed in the band for about two months.

After many changes with drummers, where he excelled Robson (Desekrate), exchanges of bass output and Rita de Cássia and Thaiz Gouveia in November 2009 the band goes through reforms back sound and style is renewed gaining more aggressively with the Death Grindcore fixed until June/2010 training with Shirley on lead vocals, guitar Jaqueline, Tathyana (ex- decried) and Everton (ex-Corporal Sores) on drums.
In the mean period from July to November 2010 the band has a new drummer who left to be desired with the lack of commitment, undermining the band.

2011 the band gets more brutal with new members such as:
  Emiliano Borges on drums and  Fernanda (Obitto) on bass. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Insanity+Force">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
