C+C Music Factory was a dance music group (led by Robert Clivilles and David Cole) that brought a hybrid form of house music to America's heartland, scoring several massive pop hits there and all over the world during the early 1990's. Their 1990 debut album, Gonna Make You Sweat included four hugely popular singles, the most famous of them being "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)." Subsequent releases such as "Here We Go, Let's Rock & Roll" and "Things That Make You Go Hmmmm...." confirmed them as dance music's most successful act of the day. 

Their sophomore release, Anything Goes, failed to match the mainstream success of its predecessor although it did produce a #1 on the Club Chart, "Do You Wanna Get Funky." The group disbanded in 1994 when David Cole died of complications from spinal meningitis.

Clivill√©s and Cole had recorded dance music under other names, and had showcased different vocalists prior to starting their C+C Music Factory project. Their production work for the group Seduction is the most well-known of these earlier endeavours. After the huge success of their debut, they became highly sought after producers and worked with Mariah Carey, Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, Whitney Houston, and James Brown amongst others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/C%252BC+Music+Factory">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
