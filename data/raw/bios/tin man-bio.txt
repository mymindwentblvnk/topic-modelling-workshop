Of Finnish descent, but born and raised in California, TIN MAN now has a home in Vienna, a town perfectly suited to his deep and moody productions.

TIN MAN launched his Global A label project in 2005. The first two releases, 'Places' and 'Acid Acid', weighed in at three pieces of vinyl each, and showcased his two major musical passions: fragile deep electronica and acid house. 

TIN MAN has acclaimed releases on the Finnish record label Sähkö / Keys of Life, Cheap Records from Vienna, and continues with new releases on his own imprint, Global A .    While TIN MAN's output is diverse in its references, certain underpinnings can be heard throughout.  There is always a strong reference to Acid House music, as well as a strong reference to Ambient and Electronic Pop music from the past 30 years.  

TIN MAN's newer output features his voice and follows a "concept album" format. Thus, complete records are as important as individual songs. The songs tend to follow a simple structure with changes that grow slowly within motifs.  Mood construction and story telling are both equally important.  And with each new record, there are new historical references to tell different stories.  TIN MAN also continues with his passion for Acid House by continuing  to produce retro-acid tracks and playing live shows regularly.  These live shows celebrate early house music, its hypnotic charm, and its blissful raw energy.
