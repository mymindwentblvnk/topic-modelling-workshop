Originally founded in 2009 as a Symphonic Metal Band, Atomic Symphony was brought into life. After a turbulent time of members joining and leaving the band, it has now finally found the perfect constellation as a band of five members. However, with a growing interest for bands like Dream Theater and Meshuggah, the band's interests soon shifted from Symphonic Metal to Progressive Metal. With the aim to gain musical quality, the will to take up a musical challenge and the joy of creating gripping songs, the band has eagerly followed their idols' footsteps. The band's self-produced debut album "Redemption" was released in September 2015.

The young, five-piece band Atomic Symphony from the ZÃ¼rcher Oberland proves how varied metal music can be, so that it can even convince listeners of other musical genres. Initially (summer 2009) intended as a symphonic metal band, they developed further with several member changes and soon devoted themselves entirely to progressive metal. Their goal of gaining musical quality, the will to challenge themselves and the joy of creating exciting creations even brought them to the finals at the Axegrinder metal band contest after a few smaller concerts!

Thundering, rousing guitar riffs, adorned with virtuoso guitar solos, are supported by an energizing, fat bass and a drum game that oozes hard rhythms and thundering fills! In addition, the keyboardist gives the whole thing a unique flavor with epic, melodic strings and cutting synthesizers. The own songs are rounded off by a surprisingly powerful, feminine voice that manages to tease the last bit of power out of the music.

Diverse, from touchingly soft parts to typically hard metal passages, complex, melodic and yet compact with amazing live qualities: an atomic symphony in the truest sense of the word! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Atomic+Symphony">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
