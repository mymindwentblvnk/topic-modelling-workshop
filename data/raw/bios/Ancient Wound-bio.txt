Ancient Wound formed in 2004 in Brooklyn, NY to create a thrash assault of old school metal. A self-titled demo was released in early 2005 which included rough recordings of three songs, and in Autumn of 2005 the full length album "The Undead Storm" was recorded with Colin Marston of Pain Cave Studios. In late 2008 Ancient Wound recorded their second album "The Winter Holder." For more info contact: ancient_wound@yahoo.com <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ancient+Wound">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
