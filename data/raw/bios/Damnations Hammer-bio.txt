Damnations Hammer was formed by guitarist/vocalist Tim Preston as an homage to the avant-garde metal of the 1980's. Taking influences from the likes of Celtic Frost and Candlemass the vision of the band is to create dark, doom laden metal incorporating surreal atmospherics.

The band is completed by bassist Andy Whitehead and drummer Steve Leach. Due to logistics for rehearsing as Steve lives on the Isle of Man the band invested in their own home studio to record the debut album titled Disciples of the Hex in early 2012. Eight tracks of dark, old school doom metal with a lyrical content based loosely around the writings of H.P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard. Ancient wars fought against a backdrop of Giger-esque surrealism. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Damnations+Hammer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
