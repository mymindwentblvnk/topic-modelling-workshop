Young Marble Giants were a post-punk band from Cardiff, Wales, a trio formed in 1978. They consisted of Alison Statton (vocals), Stuart Moxham (guitar) and Phillip Moxham (bass), occasionally joined by keyboardist Peter Joyce.

They made one great album, Colossal Youth (1980), on Rough Trade, recorded very cheaply often using the first take. Extremely low-tech drum machine effects and home made synthesizers featured.

Alison Statton and Philip Moxham later worked as Weekend. Stuart Moxham formed The Gist.  Statton also formed duos Alison Statton & Spike and Devine & Statton with ex-Ludus guitarist Ian Devine.

The original line-up reformed in 2007 (with Andrew Moxham on electronic drumkit) and have played occasional gigs since.
They disbanded in the summer 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Young+Marble+Giants">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
