BLOODYMINDED is a power electronics band that was formed in New York, in 1995, after the disbanding of the group Intrinsic Action. Their live shows are extremely energetic, and layers of screeching analog synthesizer, aggressively delivered vocals, and a copious amount of feedback, characterize their sound.

While BLOODYMINDED operate within a small, established subgenre of the noise scene, their sound is broadly informed by bands such as their industrial forbearers; New York Pre + Post-Punk and Noise Rock; and British hardcore and grindcore. BLOODYMINDED has performed with a diverse range of artists, including traditional power-electronics groups, noise artists of various types, experimental, improv, and avant-garde artists, gothic and industrial groups, and hardcore, metal, and punk bands. Though currently based in Chicago, key members live in Brooklyn, New York, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Toulouse, France.
