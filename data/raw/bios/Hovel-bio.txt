Hovel was a emo/grind band from Goldsboro, North Carolina. Hovel was started in 1997 by original members Nick Wietzel, Matt Kornegay and Matt Curl. The early songs were influenced by Rorschach, Fleas and Lice and Spazz. After Nick left Hovel, Sean Edmunson and Daris King (ifitdoesntkillyou) joined. The later sound was influenced by Ulcer, Reversal of Man, Frail, Fingerprint and Jonah. Hovel played around 50 shows and disbanded in 1999 after playing a final show with Spirit of Versailles, The Swarm, Combat Wounded Veteran, Providence Union and Reversal Of Man. They released a 7 song Demo and a 3 Song Ep from their last recording session.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hovel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
