The Rosebuds are an indie rock band from North Carolina. Its current members are Ivan Howard (vocals/guitar) and Kelly Crisp (vocals/keyboard).

Howard and Crisp met while in college in Wilmington, North Carolina. That fall, they moved to nearby Raleigh to form The Rosebuds. Merge Records discovered their demo in early 2003 and released Make Out as a full-length debut album that October.

The Rosebuds Unwind EP, an EP with six songs, was released in April 2005, followed by Birds Make Good Neighbors in September. Night of the Furies was released in April 2007 and "Life Like" in October 2008.

The Rosebuds will release their next album in the summer of 2011 on Merge Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rosebuds">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
