Dargolf Metzgore is a Death-Metal-Band from Waiblingen Germany. 
After recording a double-sided Demo together with Bloody Carpet in 2005 they started to play some live gigs on a local basis. After only a 3/4 Year of existence they started to record their first release called "Captured Thoughts", which is now sold out and not to be reproduced.
In 2007 their drummer Stefan Dekant left for business reasons and was replaced by Samuel "Sammy" or "Popeye" Schäfer, which had many influence on the sound of the band.
At the end of 2007 they released their second record called "Guts, Blood & Booze" which experienced many positive reactions. The song "Horse Cock in tiny mouth" is somehow the bands' anthem which is live sung mostly by the crowds.
In Fall 2009 they released their second Album "Blood Rush" which showed the bands' development in a very positive way. While recording the Album there was another lineup change. Christoph Wolf replaced Ioannis Vasiliadis at the vocal spot being welcomed very positive by the fans.
