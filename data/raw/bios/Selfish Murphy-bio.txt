Selfish Murphy was founded in 2011 in Transylvania (Romania). They are the first Romanian band to play the so-called Celtic/Irish punk rock. Their songwriting tries to convey the unique feeling of Celtic and Irish lifestyle and the main purpose of their music is to convey the atmosphere of an Irish pub. Most of the songs are cheerful and easy to digest. 
Their track list includes widely popular traditional Irish songs such as "Drunken Sailor", "All For Me Grog", "Leaving Of Liverpool", "Wild Rover" and covers that keep the trend of today's popular songs, such as Avicii's "Wake Me Up" and "Hey Brother", U2's "With Or Without You", played and sung in an Irish Folk style. These songs are supplemented with the band's own songs which focus mainly on simplicity and dynamism.

Current lineup: 
Petri Gergő - main Vocal, guitar, Irish bouzouki
Pusztai Lehel - flute, whistle, backing vocal
Martinka János – bass guitar,  backing vocal
