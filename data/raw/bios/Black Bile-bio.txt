There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Black Bile (FIN) is the musical venture of Henri Kuittinen, who writes all the music and handles duties of vocals, guitar, and programming. For now the band operates as a quintet. Bigger audiences got familiar with the band when it was released that Black Bile would be the fourth artist to record to Sakara Records (and first one to do this in english). Black Bile is the first artist to be signed to Sakara which doesn't already have a solid fan base and some releases, which reflects the labels trust on the possibility of the band to succeed. 

The band will enter the studio in January 2008, and the album will hopefully be out in April. Few demos have been floating around the internet, but for those who have not heard them Kuittinen describes the material to sound a blend of post-metal, post-punk, and industrial with strong new wave influences.

2) Black Bile (AUS)

3) Black Bile (CYP)

4) Black Bile (UK) - Four students looks for holes to fill that are more related to girls than pigeons.
