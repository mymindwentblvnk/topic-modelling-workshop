Deep Dream are an Extreme Gothic Metal band which was originally conceived in Uruguay in the late 90's. A raw, simple sound was delivered at first. Much later a fifth element was included into the depths of Hades - a keyboard player. The lack of experience as songwriters and musicians hindered the band from moving ahead. furthermore, the departure of one of the guitarists made things not easy for Deep Dream. After spending several months rehearsing and rewriting old material, and also making new stuff, the outcome ended up in a note of optimism. Deep Dream's material now reveals a new sophistication and maturity in songwriting. A fully-formed and lascivious sound; highly charged with intense atmosphere and purposeful malignity, has taken the band off to new horizons. Although they still keep those same elements of darkness they had from day one, everything has now been worked out in a more extreme way. From the overwhelming numbers of sounds -far more disturbing-; dark themes of erotica and evil emerging from the lyrics, to the concept of the artwork, website and visual parts of the band. The result is a dark musical context that emanates finely-shaped tuneful passages filled with fierce energy and power. Deep Dream is a band that shatters the boundaries of creativity and imagination while evolving with each chapter released throughout metal history. Providing both unhindered escapism and a tangible sense of reality in all its sinister and brutal way.
