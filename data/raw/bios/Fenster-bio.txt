There are several artists called Fenster.

1. FENSTER (Berlin/New York) â€” formed in 2010 by JJ Weihl (NY), Jonathan Jarzyn (Berlin). Later joined by Lucas Chantre (FR) and Will Samson (UK). 

They make de-constructed pop music, exploring electro acoustic arrangements peppered with traffic noises and bird calls. Their lyrics are often carefully constructed dream narratives, finding inspiration in the world of ghosts, graveyards. trains, religious imagery, and broken machinery. In their music, they build songs around errors, blending melodic chords with broken beats or minimal percussion. Their instruments range from banjo to synth to inanimate objects, using slamming doors and city soundscapes. 

They recorded their first album Bones with their friend and producer Tad Klimp before ever having played live together. The recordings took exactly eight days and were a magical time, where they almost completely lived at their basement studio in Steglitz in the dead of winter. A window fell on JJ's head and shattered. 

2. Fenster is a hip-hop music producer.
