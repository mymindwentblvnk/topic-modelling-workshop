In per-Islamic paganism, Al_lat was one of the three great idols worshiped by the tribes residing in the Arabian Peninsula. Remanent of surviving writings briefly describe those idols and their greatness in the region at the time. Indeed, they are Arabic heritage of old civilization that was wiped out by future Islamic crusades, condemned by Prophet Mohammed and destroyed upon his command. 

One of the more known writing, The Book Of Idols (Arabic: Kitab al-Asnam), written by the Arab scholar Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi, gives a more extended version of those traditions.

While intentions could be as minimal as the study of history, such writings are still unacceptable by modern Islamic society. This project introduces to you a non-bias view of these myths (sometimes altered for the sake of suspense), with a mixture of oriental melodies and a harsh black metal atmosphere. A Symphony meant to take you back along side: ancient deities, warring tribes, and deserts as far as the eyes could see.
