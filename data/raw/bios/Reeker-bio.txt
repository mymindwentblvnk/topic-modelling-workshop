 Terrifying sounds are coming from a fetid backwood cemetery in Central Goregon. A troupe of shambling nogoodnicks, covered in slime and surrounded by a noxious green funk have been vomited from the grave. It seems someone has awaken the dead and put countless lives at risk. As the story goes, these vile cretins have returned out of an all consuming hatred of wimps and posers and an overwhelming urge to thrash. Whats that awful smell?! Oh no... it's.... it's! REEKER!! 


"I've heard Reeker actually goes after people at their own shows!?" -Carl (101.5 KFLY) 

"...By the end of the set Brandon from Reeker had swallowed his own tooth, I had gotten smacked in the noggin by Cody's(Reeker) headstock, and some nazi black metal douchebag had gotten beaten the fuck down" -Cal (Wormblud Records) 

"Onstage, they look like they got caught somewhere between the sets of You Can’t Do That on Television and Night of the Living Dead “ -Mike Bookey (The Source Weekly) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Reeker">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
