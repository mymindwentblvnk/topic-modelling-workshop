SACRAMENTAL BLOOD is a Belgrade based, brutal styled Death Metal band manifested during early 2002 by the erstwhile ANDROPHAGOUS guitar pairing of Milan Dobrosavljevic and Dusan Vucicevic in union with the DISENTHRAL credited drummer Ivan Petrovic. Dobrosavljevic also held prior credits with HERETICAL GUILT, INCORPOREAL and session work with STONE TO FLESH. In July that same year the fledgling band first performed live at the Trstenik 'Kolibri' festival with ex-ANDROPHAGOUS man Aleksandar Zivanovic as session vocalist. 

SACRAMENTAL BLOOD then introduced Milan 'Atlas' Suput of CONSECRATION, THE LACK OF MOTIVATION and DRACONIC repute on bass and shortly afterward acquired singer Kosta Kovacevic, a veteran of AMOK. In January of 2003 the band entered Kazablanka Studios to record the promo 'Chaos Trinity'. Vucicevic exited in June leaving the band to persevere as a quartet. However, the ex-guitarist returned to fulfill two gigs, performing with Hungarian act GUTTED and SACRAMENTAL BLOOD's debut in Macedonia that December. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sacramental+Blood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
