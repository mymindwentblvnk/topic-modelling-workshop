Epistasis is a NY-based experimental metal/rock/classical hybrid band formed in its most recent lineup in early 2011 (though the band existed in other forms for 3 years prior in Boston, MA). The band was created by composer/performer/artist Amy Mills (www.undevelopedpiles.com) who is the primary composer for the group. The music of Epistasis draws on influence from death and black metal, contemporary classical languages, hard rock, noise, and free improvisation, though defies the labels of any particular genre. 

Members are :
Amy Mills - trumpet/amplified trumpet/composition
Mike Rasimas - drums
Kevin Wunderlich - guitar
Joelle Wagner - bassoon / amplified basoon.
