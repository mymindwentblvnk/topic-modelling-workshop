There is more than one artist with the name Nattefrost.

1) Formed in 2003,  and with a shifting line up, NATTEFROST, is the solo project of Roger "NATTEFROST" Rasmussen, front man with the legendary Norwegian black metal band CARPATHIAN FOREST.    

NATTEFROST, one of the most recognisable and longest serving figures on the black metal scene, has never shied away from controversy -  but at the same time he has never sacrificed quality for mere sensationalism. 

The runes in the logo, are the equivalent of  "Satan's Terrorist". Nattefrost is Norwegian for Nightfrost.

2) A Danish electronica project (Started in 1995) by Bj√∏rn Jeppesen.
