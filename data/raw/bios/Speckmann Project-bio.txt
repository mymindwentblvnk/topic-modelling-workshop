The Speckmann Project was never really a band in the formal sense of the word. Essentially, the Speckmann Project album is another version of Master's debut album, recorded by Scott Burns in Morrisound as opposed to original 1989 version recorded in Chicago. The boss of Nuclear Blast at the time didn't like the clean sound of the Scott Burns recording, and so the '89 version was issued as Master's first full length.The Scott Burns version was released under the moniker of Speckmann Project. The Project's music itself is comparable to Collection of Souls-era Master: thrashy death metal with a serious hardcore punk influence. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Speckmann+Project">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
