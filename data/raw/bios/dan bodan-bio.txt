Berlin-based songwriter Dan Bodan was born in the great wide Canadian prairies and raised in Montreal.

Working together with a team of world-class  producers, poets and artists, he writes pop songs to fit comfortably in that space between the finger and the mousepad, the bedroom and the club, the earth and the ether.

A particular favourite, ‘What’s So New’, is a compelling blend of sweet echoing male vocal and dream-paced, tropically-tinted backing, teamed with a hypnotic video by artist Dena Yago. 

His album ‘Nudity & Atrocity’, described as a “gothic romance”, is available now on limited edition vinyl at Pro qm, Motto, or upon email request to his co-founded record label Mangrove. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Bodan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
