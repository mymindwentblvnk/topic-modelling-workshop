1) Robi Insinna aka Headman can easily be called one of the leading figures of the new disco movement. His first album "It Rough" was released back in 2003 on the small German label Gomma and set new standards in club circles while reaching critical acclaim. 

Since then he has been building up a worldwide underground reputation as remixer, producer and DJ. He subsequently released a second album on Gomma in 2006 and was busy remixing artists such as Franz Ferdinand, RÃ¶yksopp, Mylo, and Annie.

Headman has also started his own little inprint Relish Records and from time to time he puts out records under his moniker Manhead.

2) Headman is also the name of an earlier techno-project active in 1994-1995.
