Oscar Blue is an Irish singer-songwriter from the banks of Lough Derg, East Clare.

He was influenced at a formative age by the passion and integrity of Irish artists such as Damien Dempsey and the modern, acoustic - pop sound of acts such as Vance Joy, Ben Howard, Paolo Nutini and Kodaline.

As a teenager, Blue gained invaluable experience in the music industry gigging and building up an online following of thousands of youtube subscribers and twitter followers under a former stage name. By the age of 16 the teenager had played several festivals around the country and opened for some of Ireland's more established acts such as Hermitage Green, Ryan Sheridan, Hometown, The Original Rudeboys and Ryan O'Shaughnessy in venues such as The Academy, Cyprus Avenue and Dolan's Warehouse. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oscar+Blue">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
