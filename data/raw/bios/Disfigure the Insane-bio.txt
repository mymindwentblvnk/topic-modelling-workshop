Disfigure The Insane were a short lived death metal band from Scotland, UK who only released one album, entitled Ouroboros in 2010, compromising of Callum Cant on bass guitar and vocals, and Craig Robinson on guitar duties, with a drum machine used for the recording.

Originally started as Lycanthoropy, in 2009 they changed their name to Demon-Stration before changing their name again during the recording of Ouroboros to Disfigure the Insane. Nothing was ever released under the name of Demon-Stration.

The band has been put on hold indefinetely due to lack of interest from either band member and both becoming increasingly busy with other projects. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Disfigure+The+Insane">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
