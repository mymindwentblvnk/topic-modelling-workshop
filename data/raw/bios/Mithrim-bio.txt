Mithrim was both a pre- and post-Ulvhedner (and post-Skygge) name for Svein Terje Solvang's black metal band now known as Ulvhedner. The band's history is complex.

Formed around 1993 as Skygge (recording 1 demo under this name), then the band was known as Mithrim for a period of time (recording 1 demo). The band then decided to change their name to Ulvhedner (releasing yet another demo), before changing the name back to Mithrim (releasing 1 demo under that name again) and eventually switching back to the name Ulvhedner. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MitHriM">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
