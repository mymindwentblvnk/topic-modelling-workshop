Black Metal band from Oslo, Norway. Strah is a relatively new band. In 2009 they released a demo called Fullm√•nens Ve & Gru, an homage to the Norwegian black metal scene in the 90's. On Ondskapens Sanne Ansikt they seem to continue down this path, but with a stronger 80's underground influenced sound. The riffs sound more like early Bathory and Celtic Frost, and the production is everything but modern.
Strah's two members, Kniv and Anonymous, seem to be making a statement against the modern progressive black metal trend
