The Demonseeds is a 3 man combo consisting of Michael Haaga on Vocals and Guitar, Joseph Fazzio on Drums, and Craig Cazaubon on Bass. Haaga did the album art and wrote the lyrics, with Fazzio co-writing the music. 

Michael Haaga is a guitarist, singer, and songwriter, best known for his work in the Houston, Texas thrash metal group "Dead Horse". (Or as fans of Dead Horse called it - "Horsecore".)

Following the breakup of Dead Horse, Haaga formed The Demonseeds, which released the album, "Knee Deep in Hell's Grasp", in 1999 before drummer Joe Fazzio departed for Superjoint Ritual, which should also be noted that Haaga played bass on their first album.

After that, Haaga began a solo career with The Plus and Minus Show. Although The Plus and Minus Show won numerous Houston Press music awards, the album has thus far failed to attract national attention.
