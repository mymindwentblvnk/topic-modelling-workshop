WizTheMc was born in Cape Town, South Africa on the 4th of January 1999. Two years later he moved with his mother and his older brother to LÃ¼neburg, Germany, where he wrote his first song in December 2014. 

Starting to rap with his friends (NOHOMES), he realised that he always took his verses more seriously than any other member out of the NOHOMES. A couple months after summer 2015, when NOHOMES was founded, WizTheMc found himself alone in his room writing lyrics and freestyling, while all of his other friends were back to living their lives. After freestyling everyday for 2 years, he made music his mission in life. 

In early 2016, WizTheMc was eager to show the world what he had started to manifest, but the idea of a native German, rapping in English was new to German people, so WizTheMc decided to go Overseas to see how English native speakers would react to his music. Toronto, Canada was his choice of destination. After spending 6 months in Toronto, meeting local artists, getting to know the culture and being inspired by the city, he decided to make Toronto his new home and is now on the rise to become one of the most versatile and interesting Hip/Hop artists the new generation of rap is going to see. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/WizTheMc">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
