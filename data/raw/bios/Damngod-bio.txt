Damngod is a business city five piece formed in 2007 by ex-members of before the dawn and morning after. The band plays punk-influenced metal and is lyrically on the left side of the path as the lyrics are strongly anti-religion and anti-human. Although the band itself is quite young, there is still alot of experience present because of the fact that the members have alot of years and miles behind them in the form of their older projects. Damngod isn't about being nice,damngod isn't about being emo, goth or anything else even remotly gay!! This is metal with a punkrock fuck you attitude,take it or leave it!! We' made our choice and basicly we don't care!!!!
