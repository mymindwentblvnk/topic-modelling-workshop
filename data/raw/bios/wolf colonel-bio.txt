Jason Anderson's Wolf Colonel specialised in absolutely spot on lo fi nuggets of beautifully observed pop, they recorded three albums for K between 99-2002, before Jay dropped the wolf colonel moniker and went on to record some more smashing stuff that's slightly more polished, but just as touching still for K. If you get the chance, and you probably will,  go and see this guy, let him stay at your house, give him a lift somewhere in your car, and talk to him about Steely Dan.
