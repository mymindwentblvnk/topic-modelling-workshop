Andre Afram Asmar takes an approach far different than that of most electronic music producers. With equal part influences from hip-hop, dub, and world music, Asmar most often builds around live instrumentation, utilizing samples and effects as accents to the acoustics, ethnic percussion, and live vocals found in his work. Whether working with underground MC Circus (The Shapeshifters), dub pioneer Scientist, or any of a host of instrumentalists, percussionists, and vocalists that can be found nightly at his Los Angeles recording compound, Asmar finds a way to twist the end result in to a product that is uniquely his own. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Andre+Afram+Asmar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
