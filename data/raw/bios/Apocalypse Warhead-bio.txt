Apocalypse Warhead is the project of one man, Tuukka Laitinen, the former guitarist of the Finnish hardcore/metal legends Rytmihäiriö. Apocalypse Warhead was founded in 2001.

Laitinen is the singer, guitarist and bassist of the band as well as the one doing the drum programming as well as doing all the music and lyrics, except Pan Ziege (Null Dynamo) provided lyrics for three songs of the debut album (all lyrics for songs 1,2 and 9).

Nate Gould (The Rotted) does NOT play in this band, and never did on any recorded material, including this album. There were plans to do this at some point, but it never happened, so the rumors on the internet regarding Nate playing on Opening the Silos are incorrect.

Sami Raatikainen (Necrophagist / Radiance / Codeon) did the mixing and mastering on Opening The Silos. He also created the intros/outros and provided some additional drum programming. This co-operation will continue in the future releases of Apocalypse Warhead. There are also plans to recruit some professional lead guitar players to handle the solos. 

Tuukka Laitinen : all music and lyrics except lyrics for songs 1,2,9 by Pan Ziege (Null Dynamo), vocals, guitars, bass, drum machine programming

Pan Ziege : Lyrics for songs Opening the Silos (Cold Cunts Full of Fire), Extermination of Human Life, Warhead Apocalypse

Sami Raatikainen : mixing, mastering, intros/outros, additional drum machine programming 

Their "Opening the Silos" is dedicated to Jeff Hannemann (Slayer).
