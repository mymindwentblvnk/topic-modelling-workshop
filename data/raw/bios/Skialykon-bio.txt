Skialykon is a one man band which hails from Italy, created by Vulr; the debut album "Vestigio" is the fruit of lots of years of work, ideas and concepts expressed in a whole new way. The music is mainly Atmospheric Black Metal, but you have also the opportunity to hear dark ambient and experimental pieces, archaic folk elements, classical music influences and huge epic choirs. The lyrics are drenched into paganism, old beliefs and mythical representations of nature: for example wolves are the wisdom keepers. There are even strong references to mediterranean and Magna Greece culture, part of Vulr's identity.
A vestige from the past, towards natural purity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skialykon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
