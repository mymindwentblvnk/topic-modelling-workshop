Brute Forcz - Kick-Ass heavy metal hailing from Los Angeles, California.
The band was formed by ex-pro wrestlers Slammer (Drums) and Jammer (Bass/Vocals) with Tim Thomas on Guitar and are influenced by Motorhead, Judas Priest, Motley Crue, Kiss & more.

With one album under their belt entitled ‘Out For Blood’ featuring their debut single ‘Sex Machine’, and a number of prestigious support slots including WASP, Michael Schenker, Loudness, Joey Belladonna & more, the band really are set to take the world by Forcz.

After having recently signed a world wide deal with Metal Music Bookings & Management, the band have got straight back into the studio to work on their second release, so watch this space and stay tuned!
