The story of the band dates back to winter 2001 when guitarist Dima and drummer Sava met each other. After experimenting in various trends of metal music their style gradually approximated to the gothic romance. During 2002/2003 the band made two demo records, the last one was mixed at Astia studio (FIN) by Anssi Kippo. In autumn 2003 the musicians started searching for a new vocalist and Wlad became the new Tearfall's voice Almost all lyrics and vocal parts have been written anew, and it sounded different from what had been before. The fresh blood received seemed to be what the band really needed. The band members themselves do not insist on defining their style as gothic/love metal. ``It's just rain, loneliness, nights so much brighter than the daylight; something between fragileness of heart and it's indomitable will... it's the STRANGENESS of the world that pierces you through with its beauty and makes you hope... maybe that's what we would like to express with our music.`` <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tearfall">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
