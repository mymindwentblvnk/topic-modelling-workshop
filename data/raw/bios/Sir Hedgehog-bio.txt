Vancouver Doom afficianados SIR HEDGEHOG came into being in 1995 comprising vocalist Jonas Fairley, guitar player Paul Slater, bassist Simon Oliver and drummer Steve Oliver. This version of the band recorded the 1997 demo 'The Legend Of Sir Hedgehog', issued in 1997

A debut demo, "The Legend of Sir Hedgehog", was released in 1997. In late 1998 these sessions were compiled with other demo recordings for a limited run CD. The following year Simon Oliver made his exit and Brendy Marklinger assumed the bass role.

The eponymous album (2001) became a talking point on the Stoner underground scene for its portrayal of Zeppesque nostalgia. Oddly many reviewers failed to note the inclusion of an extra unaccredited track dubbed 'Blonde Sabbath', a somewhat bizarre amalgamation of BLACK SABBATH's 'Children Of The Grave' and BLONDIE's 'Call Me'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sir+Hedgehog">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
