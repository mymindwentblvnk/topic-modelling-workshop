Alice Clark, born in the late 1940s in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn was an American soul singer, she died in 2004.

From her debut, 1968 Rainy Day Records single, ‘Say You’ll Never (Never Leave Me)’, to her eponymous 1972 album, recorded for Bob Shad’s Mainstream Records, 15 tracks are all that remains of Clark’s career. Yet they carry such an emotional impact that her reputation continues to grow. Clark’s single for Warner Bros-Seven Arts Records, ‘You Hit Me (Right Where It Hurt Me)’, a big hit on the Northern Soul scene, and tracks from Clark’s album, ‘Never Did I Stop Loving You’ and ‘Don’t You Care’ were equally important numbers when DJs revived them on the acid jazz and contemporary soul scene during the 1990s.

‘Hard Hard Promises’, ‘I Keep It Hid’ and ‘It Takes Too Long To Learn To Live Alone’ are, among other, highlights.
