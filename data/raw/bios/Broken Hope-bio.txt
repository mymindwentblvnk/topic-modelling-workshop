Broken Hope is a grindcore/death metal band founded in the late 1980s. The project spanned roughly twelve years, culminating in five albums between 1991 and 1999.

Joe Ptacek (vocals), Jeremy Wagner (guitar), Brian Griffin (guitar), and Ryan Stanek (drums) formed the core of Broken Hope.  They scored a deal with the then-fledging Grindcore/RedLight Label and cut their debut album, Swamped in Gore.

Following that release, Metal Blade Records quickly signed the band and they released their second album, The Bowels of Repugnance, in 1993.

The band's third and fourth albums, Repulsive Conception and Loathing, were released in 1995 and 1997, respectively. The band then switched to the Martyr label and their last album, Grotesque Blessings, was released in 1999.

Broken Hope announced their disbandment in April of 2002. Former members include Shaun Glass, Sean Baxter, Larry DeMumbrum, and Ed Hughes.

There were talks of a reunion in 2007, but ultimately nothing came of it. On January 20, 2010, Joe Ptacek was found dead from an apparent suicide. In 2012 the band reunited with Damian "Tom" Leski of Gorgasm handling vocal duties. In September they went on a North American tour as direct support for Obituary.

In 2013 they released a new album, Omen of Disease on Century Media Records. The digipack edition featured a documentary dvd detailing the history of the band. They also toured as direct support to Deicide throughout North America.
