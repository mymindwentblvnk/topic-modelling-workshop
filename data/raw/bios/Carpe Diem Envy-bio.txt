Carpe Diem Envy (which means Sieze The Day Envy) was a short lived band formed in 2000 which played a variety of genres, ranging from stoner metal to sludge to progressive, 60's/70's psychedelia and various other musical tastes.  

The band released a demo called "Nebular Hypothesis" sometime in 2003.  The band members were Josh Babylon, Dan Kurfist, and Jeff Lewkowitz.  

The band has broken up circa 2005 but the members reformed with their post-Carpe Diem Envy project Stone*Man in 2006 but that eventually ended within the same year.  Band members were also apart of bands like Invidia, Mosh Condom, Black Reign, The Nightmare Asylum and other local NYC bands.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carpe+Diem+Envy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
