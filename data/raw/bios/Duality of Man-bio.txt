The four-piece band Duality of Man from Braunschweig, Germany exists since autumn 2004 and has already played various shows in the local area. Their music is taking place in the same musical field as bands like Neurosis, Isis, Cult of Luna or other German bands like Tephra, IRA etc. In their very tense and dynamically structured songs, beautiful clean instrumental parts turn into heavily distorted mayhem that is combined with the very angry and desperate voice of the lead singer to create a dramatic atmosphere which is constantly changing between anxiety and relief. It is an atmosphere that the listener can hardly escape, especially when experiencing the band in a live situation.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Duality+Of+Man">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
