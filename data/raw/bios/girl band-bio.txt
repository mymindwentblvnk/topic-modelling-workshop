Now known as Gilla Band. Band formed in Dublin, Ireland consisting of Dara Kiely (vocals, guitar), Alan Duggan (guitar), Daniel Fox (bass), Adam Faulkner (drums).

Girl Band were the latest in a long line of "Girl" bands that includes such notables as Girls, Shy Girls, September Girls and Girl Unit - and that's not even mentioning the "Women" ones such as Women, Woman E and Woman's Hour. Usually when an indie band adopts the female sex (is there an indie band called Female Sex? There ought to be) as part of their moniker there is an element of snarkiness going on, and so it is with Girl Band. They took their name after meeting "an annoying girl" in a bar one night. Apparently, she liked the Wombats. "She was such an awful woman," said the guitarist afterwards. Lucky she didn't express a predilection for Nigel Farage or someone. Or U2. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Girl+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
