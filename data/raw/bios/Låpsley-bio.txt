After an explosive rise to fame as a teenager, when she first uploaded her minimal, mournful self-produced electronica to SoundCloud, Merseyside-hailing Holly Lapsley Fletcher AKA Låpsley’s debut album Long Way Home was released to critical acclaim on XL in 2016. 

Singles ‘Hurt Me’ and ‘Falling Short’ confirmed her as one of the most exciting new songwriting talents, whilst DJ Koze’s disco edit of ‘Operator’ produced an instant dancefloor classic. 

Second album Through Water marked a shift from adolescence into womanhood and from introverted bedroom producer to a more confident, conscious artist – lead single ‘Womxn’ proudly asserted her queer identity and a more assured, upbeat direction. 

Holly has since asserted herself as a successful writer and top liner within the music industry, having recently signed publishing with Young and Sony, and returning with her own original music with ‘‘32 Floors’. A bold reintroduction to Låpsley as an artist, ‘‘32 Floors’ is a song about falling in love - but also, into obsession - ahead of much more music to follow soon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/L%C3%A5psley">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
