Nothing is an American shoegaze band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States formed in 2011 by Domenic Palermo. Previously, Palermo was the brains behind the early 2000's hardcore punk act Horror Show, which was put on hold in 2002 after Palermo was incarcerated for a stabbing that eventually led to a 2 year prison sentence. Upon his return, Palermo would take a lengthy hiatus from music. In 2011, Palermo released a demo tape entitled Poshlost / пошлость under the moniker Nothing. After several attempts at constructing a solid lineup for the band, Palermo met Brandon Setta. Setta would bring a lush, rich soundscape and a fresh approach to Palermo's vision for the band. 

Setta and Palermo would handle the writing for the next release, a very rare 12" EP that was released on Japanese boutique label Big Love Records called Suns and Lovers. It was limited to 300 copies and the band's share was donated back to the label for a Tsunami Relief Charity.

The next release was the Downward Years to Come EP, which was recorded at the Rubber Tracks Studio in Brooklyn with Kyle "Slick" Johnson. The record was released by Baltimore Label A389 Records in November 2012. The record was written by Palermo and Setta. The concept behind Downward Years to Come was a dedication to several different poets who had taken their own lives.

Setta and Palermo would again head into the studio in 2013, this time with Jeff Zeigler at Uniform Recordings to write their first album and sign with Relapse Records. The debut album Guilty of Everything was released on March 4, 2014.

As a result of touring together, members of Nothing and the shoegaze band Whirr formed a gothic rock / post-punk side project called Death of Lovers. Nick Bassett, lead guitarist and songwriter of Whirr, joined Nothing as the bassist from 2014-2017. Aaron Heard is the current bassist for Nothing, joining the band in 2017.

Nothing released a Whirr / Nothing split November 17th, 2014 on Run for Cover Records. The second LP entitled Tired of Tomorrow was released May 13, 2016 on Relapse Records. The third LP Dance on the Blacktop was released August 24, 2018 on Relapse Records.

In early 2019, founding member Brandon Setta departed the group due to personal issues and was replaced by Cloakroom guitarist and vocalist, Doyle Martin. Nothing released their fourth album  The Great Dismal via Relapse Records on October 30, 2020; the first to feature Doyle Martin as well as bassist Aaron Heard.

2) Nothing is a dark ambient / noise / experimental side-project of Jason William Walton (Agalloch, Especially Likely Sloth) with guest appearances from a few others on each new release.

Since the mid '90s they have released four albums, various compilation appearances and a few limited releases as well as a handful of live performances . Each release exploring a different theme, a different style and a different approach, and never being content with what they have achieved.

Becoming increasingly disillusioned with the experimental, noise and power electronics scene that Nothing found itself in, and after the Cobra-live-performance fiasco, Walton gave up on Nothing. In 2008 Walton said "2008 presents me with a new situation, and leaves me inspired. I am reinventing Nothing once again.."

Why we exist... there is hope out there. We're stuck in a Social Psycle world of orange dumb arse teenage girls that drink stupid amounts, puke it all over the streets then f**kin' Facebook it. We're lost in a Social Psycle world where a musician is now defined as a dude who smacks some keys on his £1000 Apple Mac. 

Influences: Alkaline Trio, Zebrahead, NOFX, The Offspring, Brand New, Sugarcult, The Ataris Less Than Jake, Yellowcard, Sprung Monkey.
