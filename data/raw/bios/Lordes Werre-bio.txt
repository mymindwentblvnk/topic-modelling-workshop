A conception of the band goes back to early 1993. Despite all the trends and cool styles at the moment founding members Rob Elliott (guitars and vocals) and Ben Elliott (drums and bass) started jamming the music they had always loved and lived for. Released in 1994 "The Dark Ascension" demo and two years later "Canticles of Armageddon" MCD showed band's natural progression.

1997 brought about the acclaimed "Demon Crusades". This album was Lordes Werre's best and worst moment as they disbanded shortly after the album was recorded. Rob Elliott originally did the vocals for "Demon Crusades" but was unable to finish them because of incarceration. Scott Carroll only did vocals on this album. All other releases have Elliott's vocals. Some of the "Demon Crusades" vocals by Elliott can be heard on "Dukes of Thrash" which is a best of and unreleased tracks cd put out by Reaper Records USA.
