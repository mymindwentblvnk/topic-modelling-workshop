2. Indie rock band from Cork, Ireland
ROWAN are a highly anticipated Indie band from Ireland - made up of multi-instrumentalists Dylan Howe, Fionn Hennessy-Hayes and Kevin Herron.
 
Rowan's harmoniously rich compositions are laden with melodies that bring the listener to a familiar place with a tasteful twist of their own nature. Their acute and lucid sound is a melange of Indie with influences from most other genres. A melodic style reminiscent of Arcade Fire, The Strokes, Bombay Bicycle Club and Flyte.

Following the success of their Debut release 'No One Is Safe Here' EP, the band have just signed with Beverly Martel in LA. 

Rowan are set to release their 'Everybody Talks' EP on the 23rd of July this year.
