(Not to be confused with the Danish death metal act Indespair, now known as Eciton)

Due to many line-up changes it's hard to point out when the band was really formed. Let's say that everything started back in 2003 when two current guitarists of InDespair met. Constant line-up changes and inability to find suitable singer hindered the band's progress till 2006, when they managed to record their first 3-track demo in a line-up that already consisted of current guitarists, bass player and drummer. Right after exiting the studio the band parted ways with their singer. They waited a year to complete the current line-up, which entered the studio in April 2007 to rerecord three songs from the first demo and add two more. Recording was finished in the beginning of August. The band released the EP entitled No Escape on their own on 17th January 2008 and currently sells it through online auctions.

After releasing the CD InDespair focused on promoting their music and playing gigs (including two shows with Tyr on their Polish tour leg in June 2008, with Blaze Bayley in March 2009, opening for Sabaton in April 2009 and for Polish legends Turbo in November 2009 and playing alongside Crystal Viper, Lonewolf and Wild Knight i Warsaw in January 2010). The band spent almost whole year 2010 on preparations to record a full lenght album which is supposed to be released in mid-2011.
