Dutch Death Metal from Amersfoort

Xantossa, founded by drummer Edward Vereijken in 2005, is a Dutch deathmetal band that plays an energetic mixture of 'Mechanical-' and 'Old school' deathmetal. 

The current Xantossa line-up consists out of Edward Vereijken (drums), Sander Boere (vocals), Harry van Breda (guitar/vocals) and Jeff McBacon (bass).

May 14th 2005 Xantossa recorded their maiden demo entitled 'Negative Influence' in a "Closed live-session environment" @ De Peppel - Zeist with producers Dave Outshoven & Wim 'The FÃ¶hn' van Brakel who were responsible for that monstrous live-sound.

All songs from the "Negative Influence" demo are freely available for download.

September/October 2006 Xantossa is planning to return to the studio to record their second demo entitled 'The Ritual'.
