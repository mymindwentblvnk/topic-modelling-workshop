Stornoway was a British alternative indie folk band who formed in 2006 in the Cowley Road area of Oxford, UK. The band consisted of singer and guitarist Brian Briggs, multi-instrumentalists Jon Ouin and Oli Steadman, and the latter's brother Rob Steadman on drums. The band was often joined by trumpeter Adam Briggs and violinist Rahul Satija. 

In October 2016 the band announced that they would be splitting up after a farewell tour during spring 2017. They played their final show on 12 March 2017.

Named after the Hebridean town on the Isle of Lewis, which appears on all UK televised weather reports and shipping forecasts, the group incorporates string instruments and keyboards, supported by a typical pop backline of guitar, drums, and bass guitar. The band is signed to the British independent record label 4AD. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stornoway">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
