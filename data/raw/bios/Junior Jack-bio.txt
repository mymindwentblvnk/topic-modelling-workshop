Vito Lucente, better known as Junior Jack, is a house music producer and DJ, born in Italy, but resident in Belgium. He is better known for the singles "My Feeling", "Thrill Me (Such A Thrill)", "E Samba", "Stupidisco" and "Da Hype", the latter featuring vocals by Robert Smith from The Cure.

In 1995, he abandoned Eurodance and adopted the name Mr. Jack (which would later morph into Junior Jack), dabbling in house music. He entered the UK Top 40 with the singles "My Feeling", "Thrill Me (Such A Thrill)", "E Samba", "Dare Me (Stupidisco)" and "Da Hype", the latter featuring vocals by Robert Smith from The Cure and uses samples from "I'm So Hot For You" by Bobby Orlando. His album Trust It was released to critical acclaim[citation needed]. "My Feeling" and "Stupidisco" were built around vocal samples from, respectively, "Saturday Love" by Alexander O'Neal and Cherrelle, and "Dare Me" by The Pointer Sisters. His latest single was a remake of "Dare Me (Stupidisco)", with vocals from Shena, which reached #20 in the UK Singles Chart on 25 February 2007

Lucente has also worked with disco artist Oliver Cheatham under the name Room 5, achieving the #1 in the UK's Top 40 charts and the European Dance Charts with the single "Make Luv", a remake of Cheatham's "(Get Down) Saturday Night". Junior's own "E-Samba" became the second biggest club hit in year 2003. As a remixer, he has reworked tracks for artists such as Whitney Houston, Moby, Bob Sinclar and Utada.

So far, he has only released two records, Trust It, one under the name Junior Jack, and Music And You, as Room 5, both from label PIAS Recordings.

In 2007 "Stupidisco" was re-released as "Dare Me (Stupidisco)" complete with a newer vocal that removed the initial sample from the Pointer Sisters <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Junior+Jack">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
