Istapp, which means icicle, is a Swedish Melodic Black Metal band, formed Nättraby, Blekinge in Sweden, in 2000. Their lyrics are based on winter, apocalypse, and anti-worship of the sun. 

They have released three demos so far, one compilation titled "Köldens Union" which features songs from the two first demos and in June their first full-length "Blekinge". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Istapp">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
