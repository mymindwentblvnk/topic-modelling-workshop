Marsheaux is a Greek synthpop duo, made up by Marianthi Melitsi (vocals, synthesizers) and Sophie Sarigiannidou (vocals, synthesizers). Originally from Thessaloniki, Greece, they moved in 2000 to Athens and started Marsheaux in 2003 in order to express their love for the electropop of the 80s. They make electronic music in the tradition of bands like The Human League, Depeche Mode, New Order, Yazoo and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. The band's name is derived from the first syllable of each of their names.

Their first release was a Gershon Kingsley cover,  "Pop corn", in 2003. Other singles issued are "Hanging On" (2007), "Ghost" (limited 7" vinyl edition, 2008), "Breakthrough" (2009) and "Summer" (2009).

To date, the band have released five studio albums: E-Bay Queen (2003), Peek a Boo (2007), Lumineux Noir (2009), Inhale (2013), and Ath.Lon (2016). They have also released an album of demos and covers,  E-Bay Queen is Dead (2012). In 2015 the band covered Depeche Mode's album A Broken Frame in its entirety, along with a remix album of the same: An Extended Broken Frame. They are currently signed to Undo Records.

As well as recording original material, Marsheaux have also undertaken remixes for other artists like Depeche Mode, Moby, Client, Kylie Minogue, Hurts and Gwen Stefani. The duo have played support slots for Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and Róisín Murphy in Greece, and Client in Germany. 

Their work was praised by BBC 6Music's Tom Robinson and Stuart Maconie. OMD's Andy McCluskey also expressed his admiration: “I do have a soft spot for Marsheaux I have to say. They have a certain sort of wispy, melancholic charm...” (Electronically Yours interview).

Marianthi - Microkorg, Minimoog, Speak&Math, Roland SH-101, Yamaha CS01; Sophie - Microkorg, Winston, Speak&Spell, KORG MS 10, Roland aJuno2, AKAI Ax80, Roland CR78.
