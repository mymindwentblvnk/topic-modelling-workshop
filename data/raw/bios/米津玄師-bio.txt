米津玄師 (Yonezu Kenshi), born on March 10, 1991, is a singer, songwriter & illustrator. He has released vocaloid music under the name ハチ (Hachi) since 2009. His official home page is at Reissue Records.

On May 16, 2012, he released his debut non-vocaloid album, diorama, using his real name. He was picked up by a major label (Universal Music Japan) about one year later, and released the single, サンタマリア (Santa Maria) on May 29, 2013. On October 23, 2013, he released the single MAD HEAD LOVE / ポッピンアパシー (MAD HEAD LOVE / Poppin' Apathy). Along with all of his releases, he created the illustrations for the covers. On April 23, 2014, his second full album was released entitled YANKEE.

On October 8th, 2015, he released his third full album, entitled Bremen. Featuring the singles Unbelievers, Fluorite, and Flowerwall, 米津玄師 tried to move away from his previous sound. In an attempt to make "a universal album everybody could relate to", he tried to remove himself from the album as best he could.

In 2017, he released the album BOOTLEG, featuring a collaboration with DAOKO. The record won Album of the Year at the 60th Japan Record Awards.

In 2018, Kenshi released his famous single Lemon, which was a chart-topping success and really helped him to reach recognition across Japan, as he went on to write for artists like 嵐 and Masaki Suda. The next string of singles across 2018 and 2019, and the album STRAY SHEEP that followed in 2020 were also met with great commercial success. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/%E7%B1%B3%E6%B4%A5%E7%8E%84%E5%B8%AB">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
