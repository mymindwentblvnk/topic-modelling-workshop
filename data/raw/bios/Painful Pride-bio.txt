A garage, heavy metal band formed 1983 in Karlskoga, Sweden, by guitarists Tommy Carlström and Örjan Härdig. Örjan Härdig did the most work with brilliant compositions of both lyrics and music. 
Original members were Håkan Eriksson (Drums), Johan Jansson (Bass) and Kåre Ander (Vocals). Johan were replaced by Marko Malstam and later Kåre was replaced by Peter Ljungqvist and some time later the band choose to add a keyboardist, Håkan Bergqvist. The band made some professional demos that never hit the market but will end up at Last-fm in time.

Painful Pride left the scene in 1989 and the pieces were shattered until 1999 when Painful Pride once more hit the stage with two new members, Niklas Bäckman on bass and Jimmy Fahlin on drums. Örjan took over the vocals and Tommy did his best to back him up. 

2008 Painful Pride found an American vocalist, Glenn Ralph (Allen Crane) and a Swedish drummer,  Markus Nowak (Da Buzz, Lambretta etc) for the the new project called "Lost Memories". Markus is also working in the role of sound engineer, producer etc for the project. The band will record the tunes in January and they will end up here on last-fm for sure.

2009. The first two, new Demos is almost ready to be shipped to USA for vocal tracks by Glenn Ralph.

Peter Ljunqvist  joined the force once more with his strong voice and Misconducts drummer Danny "Thrash" Petri will join in for rehersals and  LIVE gigs.

The saga continues......
