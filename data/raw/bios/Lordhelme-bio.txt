Copied  from mp3.com :
Lordhelme is a solo project that I started in 1998. Originallyfrom Brisbane, Australia but now I am currently located in North Bay, Canada. Project was shutdown sometime in 2002.
Lordhelme is described as "Melodic / Symphonic Black Metal with sonorously blasting concertinos in waves of emphatic overtures."
Lyrics are loosely based on themes of Dragons and Fantasy, which is reflected well within the music style.
