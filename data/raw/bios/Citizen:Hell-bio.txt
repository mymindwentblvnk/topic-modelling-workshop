It happened in the sixth year of the second millenium...

From the erstwhile formations Eisenhower and Advice, the delegates of hell, CITIZEN:HELL, raised like Phoenix from the ashes.

The possession of metal and the obsession to spread fear and anxiety, forced Attila (D), Andy (B), Dirk (G), Mischa (G) and Lori (V) to grind down the world with their infernal tunes of True-, Viking-, Thrash-, and Death Metal, showing no mercy!

After some gigs and a demo, their apocalyptic ride has been stopped immediately, because Attila leaved the band...

But the will to proclaim the mischief was even stronger...

So it came that in the sixth month of the year 2007 A.D. a new combatant named Rafael (D) has been found. With his abilities at the drums of war, he reignited the almost extinguished flame of hatred !

They are as furious than ever...

Soon the unspeakable plague shall come all over the land...

Even YOU will perish !
