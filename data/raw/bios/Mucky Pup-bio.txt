Mucky Pup was a hardcore band formed in Bergenfield, New Jersey, USA in 1985. They split up in 1997, but did much reunion shows. 

Mucky Pup began as a hardcore band formed in Bergenfield, New Jersey in 1985, when brothers John (drums) and Chris (vocals) Milnes joined up with Dan Nastasi (guitar) and former Hades member, Scott LePage (bass). The band went through various incarnations and several musical style changes while gaining minor success in both the USA and Europe. Arguably, their breakthrough moment occurred when Berke Breathed picked their songwriting contest entry for release with a 1987 Bloom County comic strip compilation. However, their European success, based on strong tours and charting for the 1989 A Boy in a Man's World album, surpassed all recognition achieved in their home country <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mucky+Pup">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
