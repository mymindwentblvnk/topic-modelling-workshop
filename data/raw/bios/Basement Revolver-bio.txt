Basement Revolver plays introspective indie rock music, reminiscent of The Pixies and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. The drone of the city haunts frontwoman Chrisy Hurn: stories woven with factory skylines and gritty streets are sung in a voice pure as waterfalls. The heavy lines of bass/synth player Nimal Agalawatte and drummer Brandon Munro are bedrock for Hurn's ethereal and immediate guitar work. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Basement+Revolver">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
