Foxhole is a six-piece, generally instrumental post-rock group from the Southeastern Corridor of these United States.

The band's first two releases, EP1 and EP2:X, were self-released by the band in 2001-2002. These were self-recorded, hand-packaged (materials included canvas, screening ink, embossing) and are currently out of print.

Foxhole signed to Michigan's now-defunct Selah Records in 2003, and released their first full-length album, "We the Wintering Tree," on Selah in 2004. Two years later, the band's short album "Push/Pull" was released on Philadelphia's Burnt Toast Vinyl labelâ€”in both a CD-EP form as well as a 2xLP, four-band compilation vinyl edition. "We the Wintering Tree" was also set to be reissued on Burnt Toast Vinyl in fall 2007.
