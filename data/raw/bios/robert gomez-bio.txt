Robert Gomez began making music at the tender age of 7 putting on his first ‘show’ for friends and family at a Baldwin piano store in his hometown of Corpus Christi, TX. His years to follow could be considered that of a musical vagabond moving through an eclectic run of various side man stints with the likes of Cuban guitar (tres) master Nelson Gonsales, Turkish singer and multi-instumentalist Omar Faruk Tekbilek and the Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Circus band. These various projects were valuable but nothing compared to that of writing his own music and employing his ethereal voice. Now with Robert’s third full-length release (the most recent, Brand New Towns released on Bella Union in 2007), Pine Sticks and Phosphorus displays a lyrical cascade of story wrapped around his compositional genius and musical prowess. Co-Produced by Matt Pence of Centro-Matic and featuring members of The Polyphonic Spree, Midlake, Postmarks and Sarah Jaffe, this beautiful masterpiece is Robert’s finest to date.
