There are five known artists with the name G.O.D.

1)G.O.D (Grandstand Of Devils) is a cultic Hungarian hardcore-rap group in the early '90s. Grandstand Of Devils were: Dezi and Bobafett.  Their albums were spreading by tape-copy


2) G.O.D. - an acronym for Grotesque Organ Defilement - is an old-style Goregrind band from Peterborough / Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. Their sound draws influences from various styles - including crust, death metal and hardcore - and play within the self-proclaimed style of 'crustgore'. Although most of the lyrical content revolves almost entirely around gore, G.O.D. adamantly expresses their strong leftist socio-political views of Anti-Patriarchalism, Anti-Sexism, Anti-Misogyny, Anti-Racism , Anti-Homophobia, and Anti-Capitalism / Neo-Liberal Globalization.

Currently a 3-piece, G.O.D.'s line-up consists of: Riley - Guitar / Vocals, Dan Arrgh - Bass / Vocals and Leezus - Drums. Former bassist, Steve, left the band in early 2011. Members of G.O.D. played in Forever Annihilating The Obese before the death of their bassist, and currently play in Crazy Bomber, Excommunicated, Avon Dealer, Indictable Mischief and Twister Fister.
