Malison Rogue is definitely one of the most exciting new bands to emerge from the Swedish scene during recent years. The band started out performing under the name Ashes and played many shows all around Sweden for a few years to build a good fan base for the future.

When the band performed at the famous Sweden Rock Festival where they did a
critically acclaimed show, the band changed name to Malison Rogue and decided that it was time to record their debut album. A deal was inked with the Swedish label Inner Wound Recordings and Malison Rogue entered the studio with producer mastermind Mats Levén [ex. Yngwie Malmsteen, Therion] to record their debut album.

Malison Rogue has definitely created a unique album that will for sure be loved by all fans of heavy metal. The Malison Rogue sound can be described as a mix between Iron Maiden, Queensryche and Fates Warning. The album contains a great mix of fast songs like “We’re All Born Sinners” and “The Pain You Cause”, the fantastic mid-tempo track “The Griever”, the powerful ballad “My Mistakes” and the epic “Scars”.

Together with bands like Enforcer and Steelwing, Malison Rogue creates a new wave of Swedish heavy metal that will take the world by storm! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malison+Rogue">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
