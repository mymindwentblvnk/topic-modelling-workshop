Subdivision is a Progressive-Rock band from Romania.

Subdivision started as "Winter Waters" in spring 2008 with the core line-up consisting of guitarist Roger and members of  of Central Warehouse, Matura and Reez. The covers they played included bands like Pink Floyd, Free and Black Sabbath.
With no original material yet and looking for a bassist they used Matura and Reez's "Blind Man" and turned it into a band effort adding guitar solos and changing the song's structure and vocal melody.
In september 2008 , Aurel joined on bass and the group changed name to Subdivision.
They are now working on original material for their first album and are rehearsing for small concerts around town.
