Arsebreed is a Brutal Death Metal band from the Netherlands. They formed during winter 2000 and started out as a band totally devoted in making furious brutal US-style death metal in the vein of Deeds Of Flesh and Deicide. After a few months a 5 track demo entitled "Arsestabbers" was recorded, which was self releases in April 2001 under the former band name Bloodcum. Reactions from the press and fans were overwhelming and this resulted in performing a lot of shows and getting recognition in the dutch and also german underground. Everything was becoming more serious, yet unfortunately this could not be said about all band members. This finally resulted in a break up in 2002, were the band disbanded. After 2 years founding members Daan and Pranger got back together and formed a new line-up around them to start off Arsebreed again. Next to those two guitarists the line-up is now completed with Frank (ex-Pyaemia) on bass, Joel (Pyaemia) and Robbe K (Disavowed) on vocals and Floris (Mangled) on drums. With this new line-up the band is now sweating out the rehearsal spot to write their full length album, to be released in the second half of 2005 by Neurotic Records. Regardless the obvious obligations to the other bands all members participate in the band will perform shows in support for their album.

While Floris took off to focus on Mangled only, the band welcomes new drummer Romain Goulon in January 2006.
