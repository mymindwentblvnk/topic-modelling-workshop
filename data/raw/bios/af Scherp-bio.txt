Singer/guitarist/songmaker, af Scherp remains on a pursuit to explore and define his voice, mapping the landscape of intricate emotions, revealing the soul of things, and expertly crafting his signature sound of stunning, dramatic chants with a intense fierceness and a honest discerning eye.

Relying simply on his butterscotch telecaster and a voice that packs an over four-octave range, af Scherp has been creating his unique sonic world since the late ‘90s (though his recording career didn’t begin until 2005). While drawing influences from the likes of both Jeff- and Tim Buckley, Andreas Scholl, and Nina Simone, af Scherp´s heart aching original songs remain original and true to form.

The next stop on his personal odyssey is to finish recording the debut entitled “Requiem for a smile” consisting of seven expressive slow-minor chants. The music is centred round af Scherps voice and dreamish guitars, he’s also playing the vibraphone, organs, piano, glockenspiel, keyboards, percussion, and dubbing his voice in to gasping choir-lines. There are many moments that shine with colourful and floating string arrangements. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/af+Scherp">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
