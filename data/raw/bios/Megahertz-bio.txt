There are two bands by the name of Megahertz.

1) Megahertz, true name Daniele Dupuis (17/01/1977), started his artistic career in 2002 when he developed a particular interest for electronic music, with particular focus on the analogical-electronic music typical of modern clubs. He then started to perform live in clubs singing and playing various instruments. In 2003 he met the infamous Italian singer and musician, Marco Morgan Castoldi, whom he began to accompany as a poli-instrumentalist in studio recording and live performances. In 2004 he released his first record “Estetica”on Mescal, distributed by Sony Italy, an album which beautifully demonstrates his pleasure in mixing all the most popular electronic techniques and creates, at the same time a sort of “esthetic” of music machines. The album release was followed by a successful nationwide tour in Italy. In 2007 he opened a recording studio in his hometown of Padua in order to produce his own music. In addition he works as a producer to other artists’mixes and arrangements. In the same year he also started the “Ménage a trois” project, a trio including Jovanotti’s bass guitar player Saturnino, the popular DJ Claudio Coccoluto and himself, Megahertz at the synthesizer.

2) Megahertz are a Thrash band formed in 1985 in Teresina, Piauí, Brazil.  The band recorded 3 demos and a Split with fellow Brazilian Thrashers Avalon during the period of the 80's.  They released further demos up until 1995 and then released a best of compilation in 2001, and then their first full length in 2002 titled Pyramidal Power. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Megahertz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
