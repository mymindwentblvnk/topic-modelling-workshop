Arisen from the ashes of the too soon defunct EXCORIATE (Germany), Venenum strikes mercilessly with its Heavy Metal of Death! Even though the band has only released a self-titled mini album for now, one can assume that Venenum is a band that already matters and will for sure leave its mark in the Death Metal legacy. Mixing asphyxiating riffs of heaviness and eerie passages of morbid darkness, Venenum definitely knows how to combine the best of death and darkness into their age old Metal cauldron. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Venenum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
