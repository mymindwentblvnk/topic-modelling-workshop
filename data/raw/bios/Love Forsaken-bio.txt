Love Forsaken grow as a band in the city of Belluno, Veneto, in 2004. They soon propose a sort of non-traditional death metal which mixes the typical extreme sounds of the genre with more experimental ones.
In Winter 2004, Love Forsaken are once again in the Majestic Studio in order to record their first full-lenght album. SEX, WAR & PRAYERS is the title of the debut album. This record manifests the feeling of anger and the urge for a starting point, giving a faithful image of the band's state.
Towards the end of 2005, the band signs a contract with the Hardebaran Agency which publishes and promotes SWP all around Europe. In 2006, the new record is officially released; it obtains positive reviews not only in Italy but also in Europe and the U.S.A. consolidating the name of the band as one of the most interesting realities in the Italian music scene. The excellent results reached with SWP after so many efforts lead to new ideas. Love Forsaken write songs for the second full-length record, reducing the live sessions. In 2007, the band is ready to enter the studio again, signing the second chapter of their career.
