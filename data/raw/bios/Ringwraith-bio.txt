Black metal from Lecco, north of Italy. It's the solo project of Lord Cabal, a very appreciated musician also with his first band, Doominhated (recently dealed by the american label blackmetal.com). Songs are epic and symphonic, very similar to early Emperor, with some lyrics "Tolkien oriented", but also with some historical and philosophic analysis.
Lord Cabal (Danilo Cagliari) does all the instruments.
