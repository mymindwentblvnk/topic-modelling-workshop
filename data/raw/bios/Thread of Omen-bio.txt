Thread of Omen began as 3 friends playing covers together in Cape Town and the idea of becoming a serious band was not always taken so seriously. After the current drummer joined the band, and many new songs were written, the band began to evolve into something with much more potential. This led to the joining of the current vocalist who added a new dimension to the music. After finalizing and structuring the set lists the band decided to begin recording before taking things further - a full 10 track LP was recorded, and is available at Bandcamp!
