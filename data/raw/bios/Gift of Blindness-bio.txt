"Gift of Blindness is the collaboration of Umair Chaudhry and Simon Tierney (both formerly of Oxford based hardcore-experimentalists Xmas Lights). Taking the doom metal template and infusing it with elements of shoegaze, post-rock and black metal, Gift of Blindness' style is equally crushing as it is hypnotising and experimental. The band's first self-titled album features 9 songs in this style which the band intend to evolve with future releases."

"Gift  Of  Blindness  are  a  1  man  band  from  the  United  Kingdom  that  plays  post  doom  metal  with  elements  of  shoegaze." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gift+of+Blindness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
