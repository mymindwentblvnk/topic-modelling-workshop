Heathen Deity formed in May 1999 by Vocalist Dagon, with the sole intention to create the true essence of English black metal and to also pay tribute to the masters of the genre that had inspired them...

The band recorded their first demo, entitled "Whispers of the Unlight" in the Summer of 1999. This recording was the only one they did utilising keyboards, the band wasn't really happy with this recording and has not seen the light of day... 

The following months the band performed at a handfull of venues within the UK, the bands popularity grew and they made contact with such UK black metal acts as the mighty "Hecate Enthroned" which they played with on numerous occasions. 

The band after a few line-up changes and a busy rehearsal schedule then entered Purple Studios in Norwich, England to record an e.p. to be called, "Walpugisacht, For the Glory of Satan" in the Summer of 2002. This release comprised of tracks from the first demo and new tracks written by Azrael and Dagon. This release received great acclaim in the press, being reviewed by many fanzines and Terrorizer magazine. 

The band then set out across the UK to promote the E.P. Headlining a few shows they proved to their following they would not lie down and die. The band then played a great show at the London venue "Electrowerks" in support of "Hell Born" and "Reign of Erebus".

Now in 2010, after a hiatus the band are set to finally record the debut album. With the writing force of Azrael and Dagon once again firmly in place and the drum stool occupied by long time Heathen Deity drummer Sathan the fires of hell are again re-lit...
