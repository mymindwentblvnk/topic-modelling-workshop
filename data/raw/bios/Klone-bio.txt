There multiple artists with this name:

1. After eight years of existence, Klone has reached a personal and studied musical style. Today, the band releases a new inspired album, with various influences: Metal, Heavy Rock, Stoner, Grunge, Pop, Psychedelic. Klone finds its identity in going deeper in the command of each musical style. 

"All Seeing Eye" uses well-orchestrated arrangements, uncommon in Metal, like the use harpe, the saxophone, the chinese flute and various electro tones. The songs are sombrer, the unusual blends, the deep and oppressive atmosphere mix with progressive and melodic flights. The lyrics are in perfect edequation with the music , illustrating the concept "All Seeing Eye". A duel between the dominant and the dominated; the equilibrium between submission and domination. The disc evolues through feelings of threat, hope, self-confidence, anxiety to end in feelings of sullenness. After working during 4 months on the production with Sylvain Biguet (Trepalium, Comity, Mistaken Element) and J.P Bouquet (Lofofora, Gojira, Watcha) for the mastering, Klone comes back on the foreground and sets off again for a tour across France and the world!
