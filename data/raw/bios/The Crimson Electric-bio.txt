Anytime a band tosses me a bio sheet that states “ex-members of Mugwart” and “recorded by Vince Burke” within its confines, I’m gonna cut straight to the chase and commence with the listening. They're  filthy, sloppy and groovy as hell bringing back fond memories of classics such as Buzzov*en and Cavity with a twist that was completely their own. Though riffmaster Will Sprague and low-end proprietor Dan Luper return from that classic outfit, The Crimson Electric approaches their shitkicker blues with a much different mindset. Sure Sprague is still casting out sprawling grooves at the drop of the hat. Hell, you could tell me that some of these riffs could have been for an upcoming Mugwart full-length and I would have believed you hook, line and sinker but for the most part TCE handles their business on their own terms.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Crimson+Electric">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
