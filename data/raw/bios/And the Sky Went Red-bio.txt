Hailing from Midland and Mount Pleasant, Michigan, And The Sky Went Red is a mixture of every other metalcore band of the day riding the coattails of Poison The Well and other mid-to-late 90's hardcore. Fronted by an egomaniac and backed by a group of fairly nice guys, they played the same songs for years after kicking the bass player (Jason Johnson) out of the band. Jason wrote most of their material. Previous to Johnson's writing, And The Sky Went Red sounded more like Staind than metalcore. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/And+The+Sky+Went+Red">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
