R&B singer-songwriter NBDY (pronounced as spelled) may be a self-described “lone wolf”, but he’s leading the pack for those in his generation choosing to pave their own way. 

Having grown up moving from one neighborhood to the next in Essex County New Jersey, in a family of musicians, NBDY found it difficult to be seen for his individuality and learned to operate with great independence and determination at a young age. 

“I moved around so much as a kid, I was never at a school long enough to really keep friends. My mom worked two jobs, so me and my siblings had little adult supervision. In a way we raised ourselves and learned to depend on Nobody”, he says. “But that really helped us grow up and understand what we wanted. It made me go after my dreams even harder and not end up a product of my environment.”

But after finding early success as a singer, NBDY fell prey to a different set of obstacles that stifled his integrity as pressure from the online community mounted to conform. 

Now, performing under the moniker NBDY, the 24-year-old musician shares his truth while leading the charge for others to do the same. In doing so, he presents a uniquely multifaceted R&B style using sensory elements in both his lyrical choosings and melodies, weaving together his musical influences and his personal life experience. 

“The ones who stand out and still go for what they want, fearlessly” says NBDY. “That’s what a wolf is. That’s what a Nobody is to me.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nbdy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
