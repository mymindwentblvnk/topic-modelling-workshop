There are multiple bands called Anubiz.

1. Dutch metal collective.

2. Anubiz is a Gothic metal band from Germany formed in 1999.

Anubiz marks slow and tragic songs that are fulfilled with pain. All songs are written in german. The background of the songs is carried by nightmarish vocals, however, harmonizing with an operatic voice of an angel in the foreground.

Anubiz is a gloom sound, underlined with a highly melancholy tune, doomed guitarriffs, groovy bass, small dubblebassparts in a moderate tempo and bittersweet sounds of the keyboard. These ingredients lead to the “blackest mood of decline”. Changing the tempi and outbreaks full of hate create the unmistakable, threatening atmosphere: ANUBIZ.

Anubiz goes beyond the deepest depths of human soul. All stories are taken from the evil side of life. Anubiz.. melancholy opera in german language is NewGothicMetal of the new generation. Where other gothic-chapells end, Anubiz is at its starting point .
