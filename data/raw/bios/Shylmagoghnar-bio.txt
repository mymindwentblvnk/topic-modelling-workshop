Shylmagoghnar is a Dutch metal project founded by Nimblkorg and Skirge. Their self-produced and distributed debut album "Emergence" was released in February 2014. The project originally started out as atmospheric progressive black metal, but over the years the sound took on a life of its own. Strong influences of melodic death metal can be heard. Doom metal, blackened death and thrash metal have also had some impact. 

Musical themes and influences vary between mysticism, autobiographical themes, religion, nature, and humanity/life.

The main goal of the music is to leave an emotional impact on the listener by creating an atmosphere, but it also delves into heavier styles. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shylmagoghnar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
