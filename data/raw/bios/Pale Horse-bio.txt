1) Pale Horse are a London, UK Sludge / Doom band who in 2002 released debut album "Gee, That Ain't Swell" on Dry Run Records. From their 2nd full-length album on they started spelling their bandname Palehorse. Please tag them as such.
The band then went on Hiatus after touring the UK consistently, but recently (2007) started doing live shows again and have released a new EP called Habitual Linestepper containing 5 tracks on Eyeofsound records.

"Up and down the UK London's edgiest arbiters of leftfield noisecore have been grilling audiences into submission for much of 2002. With a double-barreled bass thing going on for frontman Seedi to lay his vocal gymnastics over much has been written and spoken about their unusual approach to rock music and 'Gee, That Ain't Swell' will only ferment the word further.

Rounded out by Tom Fowler (bass#1), Ben Dawson (drums/vocals) and John Atkins (bass #2) the band will probably hope and expect their album to make a memorable impact upon your speakers."

2) Christian death metal band who put out one album called Pale Horse "Mournful" (1993)
