Harsk is that thing you like so well; heavenly symphonic, progressive, heavy as shit - spiced with a delightful pop rock sound here and there. But not too much.

The band was officially formed in February 2007, although the idea was formed around 2003. Because of the lack of a drummer and vocalist - and a place to practice - it took a while before the band went from idea to band.

The four years before the band was formed had been used by Odd Magne and Ivar to compose and record material. A large part of this material ended up being used in Harsk's first EP "Promise of a Brave New World". The lyrics were written last by Hans and Odd Magne with the help of Thomas Fiske - the band's first vocalist.

Harsk's debut album ("The End") was released on December 14th 2010. The record was never printed, but released directly through digital channels like iTunes, Spotify and Wimp. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Harsk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
