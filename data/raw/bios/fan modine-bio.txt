Fan Modine is the work of artist Gordon Zacharias. 

Gordon has also lent his talents to bluegrass outfit Jim and Jennie, the New Orleans duo Hercules, the Essex Green and Joe Pernice for his Big Tobacco effort.

Upon first arriving in New York, Gordon released "Slow Road to Tiny Empire" as a limited edition 12" vinyl album on his own Phovsho label, selling store to store to independents such as Other Music and Etherea. Soon after Rykodisc re-released "Slow Road to Tiny Empire" on compact disc worldwide - prompting Magnet to declare Gordon "an elliptical and underrated genius." CMJ concurred hailing "Slow Road" as "the sort of stuff from which pixie dust is made."

"Homeland", the second Fan Modine album, combines rich and visual outsider-art with an acute pop awareness. Recorded with a rotating cast of musicians in 5 different points across the US, "Homeland" began as personal work songs while Gordon was working as a professional dog walker in downtown Manhattan. Production took place in a small studio in Chinatown and subsequently traveled to downtown Los Angeles, New Orleans, Western Massachusetts and North Carolina.   

Now located in Carrboro, NC, Gordon assembled a 5-piece band featuring Ash Bowie (Polvo, Libraness), Jeremy Chatelain (Jets to Brazil, Cub Country), Chuck Johnson (Shark Quest, Idyll Swords) and Lee Waters (Work Clothes, Lud). The quintet has recently completed basic tracks for a third Fan Modine LP.
