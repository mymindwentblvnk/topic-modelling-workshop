1). Seventh Circle is a Progressive/Gothic act that began back in 2002 as a solo project by Adam Pederson. Over the course of the next six years, approximately 30 to 40 songs were written. Some of them were put on the back burner, some of them lost and forgotten, and the rest have made it's way onto the upcoming debut album called THE STRUGGLE. Simply put, the album is about life, death, love, loss and greed. A concept album based on events that took place in Adam's life a couple years ago.

The sound of Seventh Circle can be described as dark, progressive rock with a melancholy feel. Certain elements are based on classical music and film soundtracks, other elements based on band influences of Adam's. There are times when you could compare them to some of his influences, but Adam has also created a sound all his own.
