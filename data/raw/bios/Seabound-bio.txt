"Seabound" is a synthpop/futurepop duo from Germany, formed in 1996. The band's members are Frank M. Spinath and Martin Vorbrodt.

The use and the balance of contradictions are an important trademark of Seabound. The songs range from cold, synthetic, sometimes harsh sounds to catchy, sometimes fragile melodies, merging day and night.

The lyrics deal with obsession, devotion, doubts, anger and fear. Yet there is always an underlying craving for fulfillment in the songs, a quest for love. Seabound combine vulnerability with anger, fantasies of power with fear. An ubiquitous theme of their songs is the challenge of confronting your deepest and most personal desires.

Their music is personal and honest, but blended with a lot of fantasy. They offer very personal insights into the psyche and they would like to take you on a strange emotional journey.

They also sing about the sea and boat-related things.
