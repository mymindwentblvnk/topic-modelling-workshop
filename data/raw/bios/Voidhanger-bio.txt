VOIDHANGER (POLAND) was formed in 2010 by Zyklon, Warcrimer and Priest to spread negativity and satanic madness through infernal mixture of thrash, black and death metal. In 2011 the band finished its debut album entitled “Wrathprayers” – soon to be out on Witching Hour Productions. Expect nothing but total unholy devastation!!!

Current line-up.

Priest Drums (2010-present)
Zyklon Guitars, Bass (2010-present)
Warcrimer Vocals (2010-present)
