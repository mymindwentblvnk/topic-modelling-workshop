Vagrond, hailing from Australia, was founded in 2006 as the solo project of Mortcer. In 2010, following the addition of Atheos, Vagrond released their full length demo  'Bleeding Fields', consisting of raw atmospheric Black Metal and folk inspired interludes. In late 2012, 'Of Separation and Departure' was released, which saw a change in style, blending Depressive Black Metal with influences from Progressive Rock and Shoegaze.

On June 30th, 2013, Vagrond released their second full length proper, 'Temporal', as well as a remastered physical release of 'Of Separation and Departure' through Self Mutilation Services. 'Temporal' is a continuation in style from 'Of Separation...' and includes much improved production value courtesy of mixing and mastering by Lord Tim (Austere, Woods of Desolation, Germ etc).
