As Light Dies is an Eclectic Mineral band grown from the depressive and arid plains of Iberia.
Eclectic Mineral style definition is a sofisticated fusion of contemporary music, noisy atmospheric doom, math death metal, and post black metal together with folk and minimalism elements which would like to every avantgarde metal follower.
Their second full length "Ars Subtilior from within the cage" is only intended for audiophiles, musicologists, most twisted 
or open minds, or simply those who want to experience another way of understand and feel the music.
