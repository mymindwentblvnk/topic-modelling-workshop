2.) Adrift is also, the Tampa-based heavy rock project featuring Jack Owen of Deicide/Cannibal Corpse fame, has chosen Mark Lewis from Audiohammer Studios in Sanford, Florida (Chimaira, Devildriver, Bury Your Dead, Black Dahlia Murder) to mix its upcoming full length album, tentatively entitled “Absolution.” Drummer Kevin Astl says “Mark came highly recommended by Jason Suecof [owner of Audiohammer Studios and a prolific Producer in his own right] as having ‘the ear’ and being a very talented guy behind the board, so the band went to meet Mark and hear some of his work. We were very impressed with his laid back attitude, musical knowledge, and attention to detail. We are very excited to be working with a talent such as Mark considering the bands he has worked with in the past, and of course due to the quality of his mixes, which sound, in a word, massive.” Says Jack Owen “We want a very big and modern mix on the new Adrift album. We think the newest Adrift songs are very strong, and we feel that Mark will mix the album with his own imprint, interpretation, and stamp of what the songs need to shine, and add mix depth and quality. You can’t deny how crushing his previous mixes have sounded. Look out for this record!” Adds Mark Lewis, “I’m really looking forward to working with Adrift on this mix. Their songs are heavy but very dark, giving me the ability as a mix engineer to augment the emotion as well as let the songs have air and breathe. The mix will be huge.” The Adrift album, tracked at CB Production Studios in Youngsville, North Carolina, will be mixed by Lewis between August 7-22.”
