Dead? is a black metal band from Italy found in May 2007 by Kaiser Wodhanaz, well known as the man behind Ad Hominem.

According to the band Dead? is about "the death/life relation, mental unstability, introspection, contempt for what is weak, and tends at transcending any kind of suffering into sounds". 

The project features members from Eternity, Forgotten Tomb, Frangar and Gosforth. Dead? is currently not signed to a label.
