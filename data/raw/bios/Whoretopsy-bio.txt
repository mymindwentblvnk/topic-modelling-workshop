Whoretopsy is a brutal death metal band from Melbourne, Australia.
The band was formed by vocalist Storma (Insidious Torture) and guitarist AJ (ex-Empty The Throne) in early 2011 with the goal of creating nothing but the most devastating music possible.
After the release of a three-track demo in April 2011, worldwide attention has been garnered and what was initially supposed to be a studio-only project rapidly grew into something a lot bigger.

2012 saw the release of their debut album 'They Did Unspeakable Things' and the follow up EP 'Isn't She Lovely'. Whoretopsy played to crowds across Australia as well as supporting Cannibal Corpse on their first ever show in Bangkok, Thailand.

2013 saw the band release digital single 'Nature's Pocket', support Dying Fetus/Putrid Pile in their home town Melbourne, and a mini South East Asia tour where they played Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam, supported Obituary in Bangkok Thailand, and played illustrious Hammersonic Festival in Jakarta Indonesia alongside Cannibal Corpse, Obituary, Dying Fetus, Cradle of Filth, and more.

Current line-up:
Storma – vocals
??? – guitar
Poey – guitar
Lachy – bass/vocals
