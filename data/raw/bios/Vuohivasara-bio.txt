Vuohivasara was formed at the beginning of the year 2005 in Vaasa, Finland. The main target was to create brutal and fast blackmetal. The inspiration to the lyrical concept was drawn mainly from occultism, dark matters of the mind and personal autonomy. The name Vuohivasara is in Finnish and it translates to English as "Goathammer".
