Short Story ;
Killharmonic were founded and formed in Kediri Indonesia on early 1997 by Innu as frontman/conceptor. In their first time they play death/grind, but now their music is more brutal, technical and heavier. They plays more progressive and complex, and they called it as 'symphonichaos gorechestra progressive technical death metal'. In July 2000 they entered Natural Studio [Surabaya] to record their first demotape with live recording system. They signed to Die Production and the demo tittle is "Hatred Diminished In Dismembered Head" which contains 8 songs of stressing and trendcrushing brutal technical symphonichaos street gorechestral death lunatics. Now the demo were re-pressed on CD format and released by Rottrevore Records for 500 copies. In September 2002 the band entered Biru Studio [Solo] to record their 2nd album entitled "Hate That Never Set" which contains 9 tracks of symphonichaos gorechestra death metal. Six new songs that re-arranged, two songs taken from "Hatred Diminished In Dismembered Head" demo, and one crust/grind song devoted to all grind maniacs. They got signed to Metal Ground Records for this album. Musically, Killharmonic influenced by Mortal Decay, Suffocation, Monstrosity, Vile, Cynic, Cryptopsy, Martyr, Pantera, Nile, Hate Eternal, Sepultura, Gorgasm, Symphony X, Origin, Dream Theater, Cacophony, Aghora, Tony Macalpine, Yngwie Malmsteen, Marty Friedman, Planet X, Theory In Practice, Megadeth, Muse, and also blend with many classical, jazz, or progressive touchs.

Highlight ;
They've got twelve times for line-up changes since 1997. Playing structured music and killing arrangement. Staging and touring around java, from small gigs till festival arena. Many singles, collaboration, and projects. Active like shit and productive like pigs. This is the Kediri's most known metal acts!...
