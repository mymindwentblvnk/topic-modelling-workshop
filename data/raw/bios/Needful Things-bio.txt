NEEDFUL THINGS has started in ’95 with this line-up:Martin - drums, Roman - guit, Michael - vocals, Otto - bass. In ’96 Martin left the band, because he had different opinions on music style. From that time we had many problems with drummers. In the end of ’96 Radek joined us. In ’97 we recorded our first studio stuff in this line-up: Roman - guit./voc., Michael - voc., Radek - drums, Otto- bass. This stuff was release as a split tape with Czech grind core band called GENITAL GORE. The same stuff was release as a split 7”EP (ltd 315 copies) in colaboration with two labels PSYCHOTHERAPY rec./ VIEW BEYOND rec. in August ’98.

In ’98 Tom joined NEEDFUL THINGS as a second bassist and vocalist. In April ´99 we visited studio for the second time to record some new stuff. New songs was release as a tape “The END OF PERSONALITY” on PSYCHOTHERAPY rec. The same stuff was release on comp. CD on MERCILESS CORE records. Some songs are also on 3 way split tape NEEDFUL THINGS / CUNT N’ BANANAAZ / SOCIAL DEFORMITY on PSYCHOTHERAPY records. During the recording session Michael left the band. He had different opinions on the style of music of NEEDFUL THINGS and some personal problems. So we recorded that stuff with a new vocalist Roman. This stuff was record with this line-up: Roman - guit / voc., Otto - bass, Radek - drums, Michael - voc., Tom - bass / voc., Roman - voc.
