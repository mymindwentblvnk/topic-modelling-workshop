DreamReaver was founded by Moritz Sohns (Guitars) and Eve Kreuzer (Vocals) in fall 2006. They wanted to play extreme Guitar-Metal that reflects the sound of their favorite bands, e.g. Wintersun, Symphony X, Sonata Arctica, Kamelot or Children of Bodom. Moreover they try to combine a female voice with Heavy Metal but not in a classical opera way.
Having searched for a long time, they found Till Felden, the Drum-Machine, for the drums and Tim Braun for the fucking bass guitar. The talented musicians both know how to play their instruments the right way.
The apparently never ending search for a second guitar player finally came to an end when Michael Smorra joined the band in July 2007. The two guitar players take turns at playing the lead and rhythm guitars. Another unpleasant challenge was to run a search for a very good keyboard player. They were eventually able to abandon their search when they found Rob Wixler, who completed the band.

The first Demo was released in November 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dreamreaver">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
