Inocula was a metal band from Northwest suburbs of Chicago, IL.

The band formed in 2004 and since that time experienced numerous changes in their line up and sound. They have released 3 demos and a full length album before their split in 2009. Their sound is a mix of progressive, melodic death, and metalcore influences; as well as deviations into atmospheric elements. Their full-length album Suntelia Aeon was produced by  Cory Smoot(RIP) of Gwar in Virginia and released on May 23rd of 2008. Inocula has been mostly inactive since 2009 and the future of the band is uncertain.  Some of the members went off to start other projects. Tyler Etters went to start a solo electronic project under the name Connectedness Locus.  Paul Petrosyan and Aaron Krause joined forces with ex-Figure of Fiends guitarist Matt Brakel to form Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg.
