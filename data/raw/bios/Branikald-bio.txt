Branikald was the black metal solo-outfit of Kaldrad Branislav (1974-2019) although normally featuring a drummer by the alias of Wizard (not the Wizard of raw black metal band Forgot). 

Kaldrad Branislav's legacy in black metal was the earliest spark in crossing borders into both atmospheric black metal and raw black metal from the Eastern front.

Sadly, in April of 2019 Kaldrad Branislav was pronounced dead after being struck by a car. He was 43 years old.

Branikald was founded 1993 in  Novomoskovsk, Russian Federation, they released around 14 albums, many of which were recently reissued on CD by the Russian label Stellar Winter. Branikald was put on-hold in 2001 while Kaldrad continued other projects after his imprisonment of that year.

Branikald was associated with white power and national socialism, but their lyrics and imagery are typically apolitical, with a focus on nature, Slavic-pride, struggles and misanthropy.

Branikald was a part of the BlazeBirth Hall circle alongside Woods of Fallen, Raven Dark, Rundagor and others.
Also contributed vocals with pagan black metal band Темнозорь (Temnozor'). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Branikald">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
