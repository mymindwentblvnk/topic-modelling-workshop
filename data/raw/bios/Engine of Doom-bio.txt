Engine of doom was founded at the end of 2005 and was established to bring back the ‘heavy’ in metal. Musically inspired by the late Dead Rivers and lyrically by French writer Marquis de Sade, this monster is ready to crush anything on its way. Above all Engine of doom is an ode to The Riff, so be prepared to stretch some neckmuscles ! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Engine+of+Doom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
