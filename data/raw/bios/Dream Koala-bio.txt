Born and raised in Paris the child of two brazilian artists, Yndi Ferreira’s interest in music started around the age of 14.

Having played Boiler Room London last January, he continues his rise, with remixes for Banks (Universal), Angel Haze (Def Jam/Island), The 1975 (Interscope) and his residency at Paris Social Club.

His latest single ‘Odyssey’, released in september 2013 and accompanying 3D music video directed by Les Gentils Garcons, was premiered on Vogue U.S.

This year, Dream Koala was chosen by H&M to be an H&M Loves Music artist as part of their in-store and online worldwide campaign.

Yndi recently achieved one of his childhood dreams by scoring a part of the ‘Une Rencontre’. Directed by Lisa Azuelos and starring award winning actors Sophie Marceau and François Cluzet, the movie will be out on April 23rd.
