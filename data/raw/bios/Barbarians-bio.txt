There are three artists using the name Barbarians: 
- a Argentine metal band (1)
- a UK noise band (2) 
- a Power/Viking metal band from Italy (3)
(not to be mistaken by 'The Barbarians', an American garage band of the 1960s.)

(3) Barbarians are a four-piece Power/Viking metal band from Italy. They released their 11 track debut album in 2009, called Dawn Of Brotherhood. It was released by the label Underground Symphony.

(2) Barbarians are a six-piece improvised noise act from Manchester(UK). Formed in a basement in early 2006. 
Members include Gareth Howells (Burial Suit//Deckers), William Anderson-Barnes, Stuart (Smear Campaign//Sexy Secrets), The Baron, Clyve and Sinead Young.
The infamous bunch are well known for harsh, abrasive and self-torturous live shows using found objects/sound, power electronics and screams/groans-often resulting in crowd participation and self-mutilation.
The legendary live shows include ceiling puncturing, demolishing indoor walls, cream cakes in unsuspecting audience's faces, seas of glass, broken bones and stiches. 
The best description ever penned about them was:-
"a bunch of weird looking guys who show up at every gig imaginable and you always wondered what the hell they get upto in their spare time".
