O-Zone was a pop group made up of Dan Bălan, Radu Sârbu (aka RadU), and Arsenie Toderaş (aka Arsenium). Originally from Moldova, the band launched in Romania. 

O-Zone first formed in 1998 by Bălan and Petru Jelihovschi, however Jelihovschi had not intended to make music his career and left after their first album, 1999's Dar, Unde Eşti ....

O-Zone is famous for the single Dragostea Din Tei, a notable summer hit which reached #1 in the singles charts of many countries during 2003 and 2004, and Number 3 in the United Kingdom. The follow-up single Despre Tine had similar success across Europe.

They enjoyed a brief resurgence in global popularity due to the online viral success of the Numa Numa Dance, featuring a previously unknown Gary Brolsma lip-synching and dancing to the first minute of the song Dragostea Din Tei.

O-Zone split up in 2005 each artist went on to make solo careers, reuniting in 2017 and 2019, but only for a few concerts.

In 2008, Dragostea Din Tei was sampled by Just Blaze and Canei Finch for the T.I. single Live Your Life. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/O-Zone">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
