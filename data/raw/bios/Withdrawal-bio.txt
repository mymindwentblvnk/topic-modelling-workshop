WITHDRAWAL are a hardcore/metal band from parts all over North America.

They play a frenzied style of crossover thrash, though consciously side-stepping the trappings of the genre. Lyrically, they are characterized by cold, depressing self-analysis and anti-religious sentiment. Interesting of note, they are also aligned with the quasi-religious group "Holy Terror" with Integrity, Gehenna, The Banner and Rot In Hell.

After a series of demos they released a debut 5-song 7" record entitled "Unknown Misery" on the Wendigo Records label.  This was followed by a North American tour with Creatures and Downpresser.

In 2010, Withdrawal announced that their next release would be a split 10" record with fellow Holy terrorsts Rot In Hell. It was to be released on the Escapist Records label, though has been shelved due to line up shifts.

May 2010 saw the band touring the west coast of the US with Crucified, including a stop at Rainfest in Tacoma, Washington. Canadian tours followed the rest of the year with Soujourner, Crucified, Shai Hulud and a stop at the Vancouver Island Hardcore Festival.

In early 2011 the band split time between Private Ear studios and their own studio to record a new 7" record entitled "Faith, Flesh & Blood". Tours with Xibalba, Venia, Creatures and others followed, bringing the band across North America numerous times.

In 2012 a split 7" with North Carolina's Blackened Crust warriors Young And In The Way was released. US tours with Hollow Earth, Gehenna and shows with Integrity and others followed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Withdrawal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
