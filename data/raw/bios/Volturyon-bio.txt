In 2005, after having played together in various projects for over ten years, Johan and Crille felt the time was right to give the world a dose of brutal death metal, thus Contortion was formed . The songwriting process started immediately and pretty soon we realized that we had some good shit going on. Consequently, the hunt for bandmembers began. 

Andreas joined Contortion in late 2005 and with his skill and songwriting contributions the band rose to an even greater level. We rehearsed as a trio for a while after that, developing our sound and had a beer (or ten) inbetween. Soon long time friend Stefan joined and a bass was thereby added to the line up. The last member to enter the band was vocalist Tobias whose brutal vocal style we felt was perfect for Contortion. 

In the summer of 2006 we decided to enter the studio and record some of our songs. The result, our debut demo Forever Suffer, contains four brutal death metal tracks which we are very proud of. 

In spring 2007 we inked a deal with OBSCURE DOMAIN productions. 

In mid 2007 we realized that we had to change the name of the band. This was due to the fact that there are other bands out there named Contortion and we felt that we needed an identity of our own. Thus, Contortion became Volturyon. 

Soon after that, Tobias decided to leave the band, leaving us without a lead vocalist. However, along came Olle and added his thunderous brutal vocals to our music. It was a match made in Hell. The songs sounded awesome. 

In October 2007 we entered the studio to record our debut album "Blood Cure".

Blood cure will be released on Obscure Domain Productions on:
