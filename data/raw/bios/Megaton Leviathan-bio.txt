Megaton Leviathan is a drone/ metal band that was started by A. Costa and Matt Brim. Costa and Brim began writing and recording songs in their basement in the fall of 2007. Since it's inception Costa kept Megaton Leviathan's sound dark and austere layered with eerie, cryptic vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Megaton+Leviathan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
