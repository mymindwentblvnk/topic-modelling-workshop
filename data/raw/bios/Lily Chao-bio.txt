Chao Xiao-Jun a.k.a. Lily Chao (Chinese: 趙曉君) is a Taiwanese singer who was active in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Her repertoire consisted mainly of  Chinese folk songs performed in a twangy pop style typical of its time.

Lily Chao was born in Taiwan in 1948, while mainland China was rapidly undergoing major changes immediately following the end of the Chinese Civil War. After experiencing hard times in her girlhood, she ventured out into singing quite unwillingly. Indeed, at age 19, Lily Chao was compelled to give up her studies to support her family and start a career as a singer, after passing an audition at the Taipei Cabaret in Taiwan. The cabaret industry was in full swing at the time, offering destinations for popular entertainment, and Lily Chao's efforts to launch her singing career immediately attracted producers' attention. Her appearances at the Taipei Cabaret as part of its shows, which combined music in Mandarin, poetry, drama, magic, and other fine arts, soon earned her a reputation. Despite the immediate success that her numerous stage performances and appearances on the national television channel won her, Lily Chao led a chaotic and painful private life. As she smiled very little and tended to appear distant, the audience dubbed her the "Ice Queen," a nickname that she would keep for the rest of her career. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lily+Chao">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
