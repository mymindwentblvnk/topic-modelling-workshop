Litvintroll was founded in 2005 as a folk band performing traditional Belarusian music with modern arrangements and employing traditional instruments from the region. During that period, the band took part in a large number of folk music festivals across Belarus. In 2007, Litvintroll evolved into a metal band, while still following the folk traditions of the previous years, where ancient instruments played a leading part in their music.

In 2009, Litvintroll released the album entitled, “Rock’n’Troll”. The release met with some success at home and received positive feedback from fans abroad. Rock’n’Troll covered a broad range of styles: from rock’n’roll to death metal, wrapped in the sound of traditional instruments. On that album, Litvintroll added a fresh, modern sound to ancient folk songs and a folk sound, to their own compositions.

The “Rock’n’Troll” tour saw the band perform at many festivals in Belarus and abroad. Among these were Menuo Judaragis and Kilkim Zaibu in Lithuania, The Days of Belarusian Culture in Poland, Viru Folk in Estonia, Northern Lights Festival in Austria, Black Troll Festival in Germany, Be Free in Ukraine, and more.

Today, Litvintroll are about to release their second album, entitled, “Czornaja Panna” (Belarusian for “The Black Lady”).

On September 2, 2012, just days before the album was finished, tragedy struck. During a show in Homel, Belarus, bass player Aleh Klimchanka died from electric shock on stage.

Album “Czornaja Panna” is dedicated to his memory. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Litvintroll">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
