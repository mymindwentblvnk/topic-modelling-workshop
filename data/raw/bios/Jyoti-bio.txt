Jyoti is the jazz pseudonym of singer/multi-instrumentalist Georgia Anne Muldrow. The alias is a Sanscrit word meaning â€œlight", and was the name given to her by musician Alice Coltrane who was a family friend. Ocotea, Georgia's first record composed as Jyoti, was released in 2010, and was named after an aromatic wood her mother had given her at the time. This was followed by Denderah in 2013, which served as a slightly lengthier jazz effort. Her third album under the alias, Mama, You Can Bet! was released in 2020, seven years after Denderah. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jyoti">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
