Jamaal "Elhae" Jones was part of the 2010s influx of artists who sang and rapped about romantic affairs over slack, trap-style beats. Born in North Dakota but based in Atlanta, Georgia, Jones came up in the church, sang in his mother's choir, and was eventually drawn to rap. As Elhae ("Every life has an ending"), he independently released tracks like "Gold Roley," "Stars," and "A.N.O." during the early 2010s and then fulfilled a career aspiration by signing to Atlantic, the major-label home to personal heroes Lupe Fiasco and T.I. In March 2016, Jones released All Have Fallen, an album that briefly scraped the lower rung of Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It featured the Kehlani collaboration "Doesn't Matter." Elhae returned the following year with the Aura II EP, which featured guest spots from Ty Dolla $ign, Rockie Fresh, and Eric Bellinger. Led by the low-key romantic ode to his brandy of choice, "Hennessy," he issued his second full-length, Trouble in Paradise, in early 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elhae">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
