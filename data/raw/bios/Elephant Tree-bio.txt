Elephant Tree are a new band, just about to start cutting their teeth in the London metal scene. Having moved down and taken in many many gigs and shows the guys have been influenced to start making their own music. Linking up with Pete of Trippy Wicked & the Cosmic Children of the Knight and Stubb in early January and Riley 'Sitar Wizard' MacIntyre soon after, things are snowballing quickly with more songs in the pipelines.  Recording in the summer for their first EP, the guys have been hard at work playing gigs over the south of England with a mini tour of the North of England in the works.
