Local songwriter Wyrd Visions is isolated and in tune with nature and ghosts. His debut EP Half-Eaten Guitar was released in 2006 on Toronto-based Bluefog records and brought him success as the supporting act for Final Fantasy and Grizzly Bear's tour the following spring, as well as playing a runway show for Jeremy Laing's Spring 2006 collection at New York fashion week. The Strand interviews Colin Bergh on his music and what he has in store for his next release, King.

When hearing Wyrd Visions you wouldn't expect the man behind such somber music to be so enthusiastic a person. Colin Bergh, however, is quite colourful in both personality and dress. For years, he has been a real man about town playing a role in the Toronto music community, with his earlier bands as well as founding local DJ night The Clap with two of his friends. He is also currently a second-year student at OCAD studying graphic design. On top of making the music for Half-Eaten Guitar, he did the layout and design-work for the record, as well as his t-shirts.
