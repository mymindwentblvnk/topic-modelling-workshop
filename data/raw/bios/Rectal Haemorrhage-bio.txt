Extreme Southern Sludge/Doom band that alternates between truly sick grinding slow Doom and truly sick grinding up tempo Sludge. Haunting screams, heavy riffing and a powerful presentation are what Rectal Haemorrhage is all about. Highly recommended for those who enjoy fast music as well as slow grinding Sludge/Doom. Not for the weak of heart! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rectal+Haemorrhage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
