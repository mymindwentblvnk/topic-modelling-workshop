Eddy Antonini is the keyboardist and mind behind Skylark. In 1998 he released his [to date] only album, entitled When Water Became Ice. With him on the album are Olaf Th√∂rsen (Labyrinth, Vision Divine), Folco Orlandi (Mesmerize, Time Machine), and several of Skylark's musicians.

This album can almost be considered a Skylark album, since the music is so similar. Some of the songs are also on Skylark's "Best of"-album In the Heart of the Princess. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eddy+Antonini">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
