Soulforger stands for melodic Death Metal, focusing on „melodic“.

Twin-Guitar harmonies, hard melodic and fast riffs combined with pressing Bass- and Drumwork, being accompanied by extreme vocals are trademarks of their sound. Influenced by scandinavian Death Metal and 80s Thrash Metal mixed with modern Elements, the band creates an individual and intense Sound. 

Being founded in 2002 in Hamburg, they soon played their first concerts, e.g. supporting Dimension Zero. In 2003 they recorded their first demo which got very positive feedback.

Over the following years the band worked hard on their songs. Currently they are planning the next release.
