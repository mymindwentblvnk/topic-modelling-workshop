Waning is a concept; a concept of nothingness, of being lost and without direction or purpose. That concept should be familiar to most of you, and requires no elaborate explanation - it is in the air you're breathing, in the thoughts you are thinking and in the lives you are living. It is what drones are built of, feed upon and are attached together with. It is insignificance and its color is grey.

In Waning's music, you will find sounds and lyrics describing humans, their society and joint relations.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Waning">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
