Not content with pandering to the metalcore masses of the past years, the members of A House Cursed have all pursued their individual visions of extreme music; varying from black metal, to grind, to punk and thrash. It was only when these five souls united that it was apparent what Nevada needed; a metal band that would be all things to all people.

The independently financed debut album "Treasons, Stratagems & Spoils" was recorded in June/July of 2006 with renowned producer Juan Urteaga (Ted Nugent, Vile, Night Ranger, Testament, Exodus & Sadus) at Trident Studios in the San Francisco Bay Area. From previous projects the band has a long recording relationship with Trident, which helped in fine tuning the album into a searing and ferocious 58 minute onslaught. At points it revisits the classic Bay Area thrash movement while at others it is calling on the brutality of the pioneers from across the seas. The following year in November 2007 A House Cursed followed up their full length with a new EP entitled "By Triage". Written and recorded with the new lineup and once again recorded at Trident Studios; the 3 song EP shows the growth the band has done in just over a year of touring and shows. One listen and it is easily understood that this band will continue to amaze and push the envelope in terms of songwriting and even accessibility. Yes, accessibility in a thrash band, as they are focused on creating songs that stand the test of time, regardless of style. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+House+Cursed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
