Dismal Gale is a Melodic Black Metal band from San Salvador, El Salvador.  They were formed in  1998 releasing one demo and one studio album.

The band is disputed to be considered a main band for the side-project Witchcraft from El Salvador because, Witchcraft split up the same year as the year Dismal Gale were formed.

The album "Dismal Serenades" was released in 2005 and had various different Melodic Black Metal themes including; Fairies and Darkness.

Dismal Serenades is not only a Melodic Black Metal album but, among most Melodic Black Metal album it's infused an 18th Century Classical approach to some clean interludes and even the song "Prelude In C Minor" is a purely Classical piece. Commonly, they both focus on a Melodic approach. 

Although the lineups have changed, the band is still currently active as an Independent band.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dismal+Gale">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
