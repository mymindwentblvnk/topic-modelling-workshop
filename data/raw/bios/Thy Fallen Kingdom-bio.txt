Thy Fallen Kingdom was first formed as a three piece in 2002, covering songs by Iron Maiden, King Diamond, Metallica, Riot, Loudness and other bands in the genres of Thrash / Speed / Classic metal. 
The Band Consisted of Akhbar (Guitar), Suhaimi (Bass) and Nazri(Drums).

The first significant member change was the inclusion of Shamsidi on Lead Guitar. Another change occurred in the Rhythm section, as the band felt Nazri was not at the level of skill necessary for them to continue, so he was replaced with a friend of Shamsidi, named Muhammad.  

Nazri and the band parted ways and the new lineup was Akhbar (Guitars), Suhaimi (Bass), Shamsidi (Lead Guitar) and Muhammad (Drums).

Shamsidi was then booted out of the band as he tended to disappear for long periods. Suhaimi switched to guitars and the band started to write originals.

October 2007, the band played its debut gig at a local club, recruiting long time friend Amir (Bass) and Bing (Vocals) for the gig itself. 

The band states that "Although no one knew us back then, we won plaudits as we were the surprise package. Nobody expected us to play the way we did and we won over Quite a few people and in the end had quite a number of people down to the mosh pit."

In 2008, Dave was recruited to be the permanent Bassist and Vocalist. 

This was the period when TFK started to get down to searching for gigs, and played wherever they were invited.

Late 2008, TFK started recording their debut EP, finishing it in April 2009.

After the recording of the EP, Dave suffered a shoulder fracture, thus was out for a period of time. 
They recruited Zaha as a live bassist, and this current lineup continues to today, playing 3 shows together. 

Dave has left the band permanently. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/thy+fallen+kingdom">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
