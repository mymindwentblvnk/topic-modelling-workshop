Where do you head musically, once you have worked with acts as diverse as gangster rappers and nu disco bands in your home country of Germany? What do you do once you’ve produced them a string of top 10 hits and multi gold status albums?

You turn your skills to the upfront club sounds of ghetto-electro and ace the dance charts with a string of jaw-droppingly original cuts. Well you would if you are TAI and he’s currently on fire.

He has turned his production expertise to the club-floor, juggling his time between mainstream production jobs and dance cuts, from his stunning studio in Munich. In 2009 his singles: Liposuct with D.I.M (Boyz Noize), remix of Jean Claude's Shingaling (for Frenetic) have seriously turned heads.

Yet to come in 2010, he has the jacking new single on Laidback Lukes label Mixmash named “Rockin’ the Set” in March, which Laidback Luke has been playing for the last half year in all of his sets. Recently TAI has been in his studio working with Steve Aoki on a Song for TAI’s upcoming EP called „Enemy Mine“, which will be released on the label Dim Mak in March.

Up to now TAI’s career working as an electronic music producer seems to be the story of an upcoming rising star. With „Lyposuct“ as his first and only release, it’s just unbelievable how he is developing right now. Being one of the most unknown faces on today’s market he’s nevertheless an extremely high demanded remixer with releases on the top labels of the electronic music section, such as Boys Noize, Southern Fried, Turbo, DIM MAK, MIXMASH, Greatstuff and others.

Definitely one to watch out for in 2010.
