Formed in 1979, under the name Rheagan, by George "Wildman" Koerber and Darrell Collins. The band took this name from the character Regan MacNeil, the possessed child in the horror novel/movie adaptation "The Exorcist". Supposedly, when president Ronald Reagan came into office in early 1981, they changed the name to Overlorde after George Koerber "dropped a Webster's dictionary on its spine and put his finger on a word on the page".

They played a few live shows in the 90's and 2000's.

Reformed for good in 2011, adding the "SR" (apparently standing for "still rocking"). They dropped the "e" at the end around 2013.

Not to be confused with the New Jersey metal band Overlorde.
