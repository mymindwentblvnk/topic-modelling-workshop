SANGUINARIUS IS A BLACK METAL BAND FROM SOUTH AFRICA. THE BAND HAS 2
MEMBERS: ANTON AND ALTA. ANTON WRITES, PLAYS AND RECORDS ALL THE MUSIC.
THATâ€™S RIGHT, ALL THE INSTRUMENTS. ALTA WRITES ALMOST ALL THE LYLICS FOR
SANGUINARIUS. SHE WRITES THE LYRICS TO FIT THE MUSIC OR THE THEMES THAT
ANTON WANTS THE SONGS TO HAVE. 
IN 2006 ANTON STARTED DOING RECORDINGS WHERE HE HAD TO PLAY ALL THE
INSTRUMENTS AND DO ALL THE PROGRAMMING HIMSELF. ALTA WHO IS A POET THEN
STARTED PUTTING HER POEMS INTO THE MUSIC AND THINGS QUICKLY TOOK OFF FROM
THERE. SINCE ANTON KNEW EXCATLY WHAT ALTA WANTED IN THE DELIVERY OF THE
VOCAL PERFORMANCE, HE STARTED DOING VOCALS ALSO.

SANGUINARIUS IS CURRENTLY RECORDING THE DEBUT ALBUM OF OVER 50 MINUTES OF
PSYCHOTIC BLACK METAL.
