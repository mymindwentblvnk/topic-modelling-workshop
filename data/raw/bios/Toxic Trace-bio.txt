1.Toxic Trace is formed in November 2007. by Djubre(drums), Dushman(Guitar/vocals) and Mimi(bass). Main idea of the bend is to play raw and fast, embracing the sounds of German thrash/speed metal bands of the '80s.Band first started to play covers of the bands like Kreator, Sodom, Destruction, Slayer, old Sepultura, etc. and played a lot of gigs in Serbia. In late 2008. band started to write their own songs and practice them for the recording of a demo. In the beginning of 2009. band records a demo Slaughter which is well accepted by the thrash metal fans in Serbia. Demo was recorded in Heavy Attack Studio. In the middle of 2009. there was change in band's lineup. Mimi left the band, and Max(Vyrderon) replaced him as the new bass player. In april/may 2010. first album was recorded. Now, band is looking for gigs and preparing new material for second album.

Current lineup:

Dushman - Vocals and guitar
Max - Bass
Djubre - Drums
