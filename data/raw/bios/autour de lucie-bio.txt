Autour de Lucie is a French band, led by vocalist Val√©rie Leulliot. When the group emerged on the French music scene in the early 90's, the trio's jaunty electro/pop/rock did not appear to sound radically different from other 90's French pop groups. However, Autour de Lucie soon went on to establish themselves as leading lights on the French pop scene, and the group's albums rapidly became best-selling exports abroad, helped by exposure in US on the Lilith Fair tour in 1997. The band broke up at the beginning of 2006, as Leulliot began to plan a solo career. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Autour+de+Lucie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
