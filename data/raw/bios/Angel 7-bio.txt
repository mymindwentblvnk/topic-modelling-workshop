Furious technical power metal-esque riffing collides with the bombastic sounds of death and black metal on Angel 7’s release Black and White.  Angel 7 hails from Ukraine, the same country that the mighty Holy Blood calls home, and they are up to the challenge presented by the greatness of Holy Blood.  Guitar solos galore and technical riffing permeate the disc, and these blend with driving synths and heavy guitars, extreme vocals, and creativity which extends beyond the normal realms of death and black metal.  Some songs even incorporate gothic undertones, while others hearken to labelmate’s Holy Blood’s folk / pagan metal leanings.  Angel 7 is extremely hard to classify into one genre, but one thing is certain:  they blend a lot of amazing musicianship into a metal feast for the ears.  Angel 7 should appeal to anyone who likes extreme metal as well as those who like power metal with extreme vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Angel+7">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
