Raw black metal band from Spain since 2000.

DAEMONLORD was born in summer of 2000. Kepa was the only one behind the band, so immediately contacted with Sixto to help him with the vocals. They released their first demo entitled “Unsacred Soul” in late 2000. They spread over 450 copies. Then SATANACHIA & HADES PRODS. from Portugal showed their interest in re-releasing this demo with an extra track in an edition limited to 300 copies. After studying a few offers and being betrayed by some bastards, WOLF RECORDS released their second demo, "As Bastard as God", limited to 350 copies. Later on, the band accepted an offer of releasing this stuff as a Split-CD, which was released in spring 2002 through DOWNFALL RECORDS.

Since autumn 2001 it was planned to release a debut full-length album with the help of the German Promo-Company MEDUSA PRODUCTIONS to spread the name of DAEMONLORD and to distribute their debut world-wide. It saw the light in May 2002. That same year, the band changed their moniker from DEMONLORD to DAEMONLORD, because (as so often) another band with the same name already existed.

After releasing their debut album, a double-split-LP with PERDITOR, NECROCULT and GOAT SEMEN was scheduled for October/November 2002. Although Sixto was initially going to be in charge of the vocals for that vinyl, finally he had to leave the band due to lack of time. Anyway he contributed with his lyrics. Finally, Egnar Blasphemy from the Basque band OMINOUS (RIP) started to sing in DAEMONLORD. The label didn’t like the new DAEMONLORD sound, much rawer and darker than before, so this release was cancelled.

In late 2002, DAEMONLORD released a 7”EP through KETZER RECORDS. The single was recorded on September 2002.

After sending promo stuff to some labels to release the music that was originally recorded for the double-split LP, KETZER RECORDS showed their interest again, wanting to release this stuff as a 12"MLP for summer 2003. Before this WOLF RECORDS had already released it as a Cass-EP with 2 tracks less in a limited edition to 200 copies. SLAVA PROD. also did another tape version. 

In October 2003 the band started the recording of “Of War And Hate”. In December 2003 the album was finished. Without delay the band started to send promos. Finally the album was released by HEAVEN ABLAZE RECORDS in March 2004 and later on pro-tape by SLAVA PRODS. After the album DAEMONLORD started working on new stuff. A deal with a Portuguese label was achieved to release a new 7"EP, but due to their untrustworthy attitude (aka RIP-OFFS), the band tried to find other label for that release, finally finding the right support in NECROMANCER RECORDS. This 7"EP was titled "Coil Of Devastation" and was released in December 2004. 

During that period other releases were planned, a 4 way split-cd with LUX FERRE, MORTINATUM & MALLEUS and a new split 7"EP with Key Of Mythras, both to be out in February 2005. 

After "Of War And Hate" being nearly sold out a re-release was planned through KETZER RECORDS, this re-release was remastered at NECROMORBUS STUDIOS and released in February 2005. 

May 2005 was time to do the "TOTAL ANNIHILATION OVER EUROPE TOUR" supporting acts like LUX FERRE & CIRITH GORGOR. After a while  "Bonded by Hatred" Split 7"EP was released under Ashen Productions/Nocturnal Empire.

In December 2005 "Of War and Hate" 12"LP was unleashed in cooperation with UNEXPLODED RECORDS.

Songs for a split CD with the Colombian SATANZER was recorded. The Split was released april 2006 on GOATHORNED PROD

The band had recorded the stuff for the third album "Hellfire Centuries" and it will released in summer 2006 Ketzer Records.
