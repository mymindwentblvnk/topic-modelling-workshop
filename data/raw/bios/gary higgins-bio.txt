Gary Higgins (born in Sharon, CT) is an American free-folk musician. initially a member of the rock & roll band Random Concept, and then, concurrently, Wooden Wheel, in October 1972, when just about to go to jail for drugs offences, he recorded the album "Red Hash".

Years later, a Drag City employee got it from Ben Chasny of Six Organs of Admittance and became obsessed with the album and tracking Higgins down. He finally found him working as a nurse in Connecticut and discovered the reason why so few of his one and only album were pressed. Higgins recorded "Red Hash" knowing he was about to go prison on drug charges and it was hard to set up distribution when incarcerated. After Higgins' release, he drifted away from the west coast to Connecticut.

Drag City renewed interest in this elusive classic when they reissued it last year. It may be decades late, but acclaim is finally coming to him.  Higgins' hushed psych-folk songs fit in perfectly with the folk artists such as Devendra Banhart, Joanna Newsom and the like. 

In 2009 his second album, Seconds, was released . An EP, "A Dream a While Back", an album mainly consisting of pre-Red Hash material, was released in early 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Higgins">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
