Katrina Johansson wants you to sing along. Not to the chorus, but to the guitar line. She fills us in, “Melody is just as important as the energy of shredding. I want people to be able to sing some of the guitar melodies and remember them, as well as feel the energy and appreciate the technique of the fast parts.”

And she has energy to spare. With a buttery performance style, she effortlessly delivers a one-note scream or barrages listeners with a flawless arpeggiated run. A self-professed “shy kid,” Katrina found inspiration, and her voice, as soon as she picked up the guitar. “It’s important for children to have positive and creative outlets, and guitar was mine,” she shares. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Katrina+Johansson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
