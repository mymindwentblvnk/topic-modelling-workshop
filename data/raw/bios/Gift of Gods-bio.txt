Gift of Gods is the name given to this new beast from the mind of Ted Skjellum, otherwise known as Nocturno Culto, and notorious as one half of the legendary Norwegian black metal band, Darkthrone.

For Gift of Gods, Nocturno turns his hand to tracks of pure heavy metal excellence, taking in a vast array of influences from decades past to concoct a special whirlwind of melodic riffing and headbanging anthems on this 30 minute heavy metal pilgrimage. Receive also features a rendition of ’Looking For an Answer’ originally by obscure Swedish 80’s band, Universe.

A labour of love over several years since its initial inception, Nocturno performs all instruments himself and has also been responsible for recording this mini-album at his own studio. Receive was mixed and mastered by Jack Control at Enormous Door, having recently worked with Darkthrone on their album ’The Underground Resistance’. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gift+of+Gods">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
