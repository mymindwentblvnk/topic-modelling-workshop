Now, Now (formerly known as Now, Now Every Children) is an American indie rock band formed in Blaine, Minnesota and based in Minneapolis. The band is composed of Cacie Dalager (vocals, guitar, keyboard) and Bradley Hale (drums, backing vocals)

The band was formed in roughly 2003. Classmates Cacie Dalager and Bradley Hale met in high school marching band when they were both sixteen years old; they eventually started writing songs together, starting with an acoustic song dedicated to a college-bound friend. The band's name, according to Dalager, came about as a typo while talking to friends online on their old band's account; it was originally being considered jokingly as a possible future EP title, but stuck as the band name when they officially started the project. Dalager and Hale were joined by Brad's sister Britty on keyboards, and school friend Justin Schweim on bass for the recording of their first EP and their first few shows in the Minneapolis area. Shortly before the band began recording their first album, Schweim left their live setup, and Christine Sako stepped in. Jess Abbott joined the band in Summer 2009 after moving from Maine to Minnesota, initially just for the summer until she left for college, however she became a permanent member shortly after.

The band have released two full length albums and 5 ep's <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Now,+Now">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
