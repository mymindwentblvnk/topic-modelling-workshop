Sepia Dreamer were formed in the middle of 2003 by current members Jonas Wrenninge and Sam Brokenshaw, meeting originally in an internet chatroom and being impressed by each other's taste in music and movies. After a steady stream of recordings were sent back and forth, the name Sepia Dreamer somehow occured and was settled on for an instrumental project with as few limits as possible. Both members are insistant upon keeping an open mind and avoiding placing unneccesary limits on the music.

By the end of 2003 enough material was ready to begin working on the debut album 'Portraits of Forgotten Memories.' The album was recorded by Jonas and Sam at their respective home studios in Cardiff, Wales and Stockholm, Sweden. The pair shared the engineering and producing duties with Jonas taking care of the mixing and mastering job. The song writing was split at roughly 50/50 with both members handling most of the instruments on their own material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sepia+Dreamer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
