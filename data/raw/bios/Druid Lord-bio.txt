Formed in early 2010 by Pete Slate and Stephen Spillers, Druid Lord quickly gained the attention of many in the metal scene. Initially, Druid Lord set out to self-release a 4 song EP, but due to interest by labels and fans decided to proceed with a full length cd. 

Recently signed to HPGD Productions, Druid Lord are scheduled to release "Hymns for the Wicked" on Oct. 31st of 2010. In addition to joining Druid Lord on bass & vocals recently, long time friend and band member Tony Blakk is handling the engineering of this deadly release. Fans of doom and old-school death metal are already hailing this release as one of the best offerings to surface in ages.

 Druid Lord, interestingly enough, is comprised of three of the members of the '92-'99 line-up of another well-regarded death metal act from Florida, Equinox. Pete Slate honed his skills as a member of Incubus, Acheron, Massacre and Kauldron . Tony Blakk gained respect and recognition with bands such as Acheron, Apostasy and Diabolic. Stephen Spillers was a founding member of Equinox and recorded numerous releases with the band including "Return to Mystery", "Journey into Oblivion" and "As the Moon Swallows the Sun". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Druid+Lord">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
