The legend goes that misery and suffering are an artist's true blessing. Dutch multi-instrumentalist Rob Langendijk has found out those words aren't just a legend, they are truth. It was within a period of personal downfall when he wrote the songs that ultimately became 'As You Burn Within Me'. Under the name of Burned Within, Rob now chose to unleash these tracks unto the unsuspecting listener. 

Don't, however, expect piano ballads with an aching croon or a self pitying load of emo rock. The shape in which Rob chose to present the state his mind went through is the shape of technical Death Metal. He combined this with his love for Jazz Fusion, creating an atmosphere that average Death Metal bands do not dare to even think of. There are brutal Death Metal tracks, there are pure Fusion interludes...there's even Metal featuring his saxophone playing! And with the lyrics leaving blood, guts and gore for what they are, 'As You Burn Within Me' is really something different in deed! 

Rob recorded all the vocals and instruments over a year's time in his home studio in Leiden, the Netherlands. 'As You Burn Within Me' is a personal statement of a Metal loving man with a heart. Those of you familiar of his work with the late Anubis will be surprised by its sheer brutality, complexity and overall weirdness. Be prepared to be overwhelmed by Burned Within! 

Highly recommended to fans of the likes of Necrophagist, Cynic, Atheist, Meshuggah and later Morbid Angel.
