Last year Catarsis surprised the mexican audience with the  richness of its music, in a festival called " Mexican Rock New Blood ".

Now you can enjoy its  first ( a total revelation) album, called "Orgasmo", where you can find their single "Roca"

* an argentinian indie rock band from Sniffing Recordings
