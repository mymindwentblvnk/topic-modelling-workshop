Demolition Faction was formed in 2004 with a lineup of veteran Metal and Hardcore performers from the late 80's and early 90's. Since it's inception, Demolition Faction has released their debut CD "THE DAMAGE IS DONE" in 2004 which sold over 3700 copies. In support of "THE DAMAGE IS DONE" the band has put together a vigorous live show opening for national acts such as EXODUS, OVERKILL, WARBRINGER, ARSIS, WITHIN CHAOS, MUSHROOMHEAD, and many more. Venues played include THE TROCADERO, JAXX, and THE STARLAND BALLROOM. The band also secured a spot on the "FMQB" metal sampler with Type-O-Negative and Bullet for My Valentine releasing the song "Insolentia" which has received awesome reviews and secured the band another track on the "FMQB" metal sampler being issued to radio stations across the country this fall. After recruiting John Wyman of Halo Studios, the band began recording tracks for its second release "HASTEN THE APOCALYPSE" in February 2008. After finalizing 9 tracks at Halo Studios, the mixes were sent to James Murphy (of Testament) at The Safehouse Productions for mastering. Currently the band is playing shows on the east coast and writing new songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demolition+Faction">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
