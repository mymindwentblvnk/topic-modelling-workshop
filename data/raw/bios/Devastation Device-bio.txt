Having just formed on the 29th of September 2008... the undeniable force of Devastation Device is shown through the numerous devastating tracks they have already written in this short period of time. Although... nothing about being in a band is new to anyone involved with this project. All five of the groups current lineup have been in and out of bands in the local London/Corbin (Kentucky, USA) scene dating back to 1999.

This project has been a long time coming... and no true fan of metal will be disappointed. Forget everything you thought you knew about local metal bands... there is only one goal that this band strives for, total devastation and this five piece demolition team man the device... the DEVASTATION DEVICE. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Devastation+Device">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
