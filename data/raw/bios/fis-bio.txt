Fis is New Zealand-born, Berlin-based producer Oliver Peryman. While his early EPs from 2011 onwards could still be described as Drum 'n' Bass and IDM, his subsequent releases, such as his two albums The Blue Quicksand Is Going Now (2015) and From Patterns to Details (2016), saw the music of Fis evolve into evermore abstract territory.
