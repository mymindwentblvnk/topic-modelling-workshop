The Polluted bio is as follows: 
Jim Bruce started his musical training at the age of 5, starting on the piano. Over the years he picked up varying instruments from the French Horn to the Saxophone, eventually learning to play most brass instruments and even spending several years studying to play the organ. After dropping out of college while pursuing a degree in music, he spent years adrift trying to find ways to use a computer and synthesizers to create the music that would bubble up out of his head. Much of his creative endeavors ended up as short musical progressions, never fully realized into complete songs.
Enter the collaboration with Cameron R.
Cameron has spent over a decade as an electronic musician, creating unique and varied music over the years, utilizing everything from hardware samplers and synths to microphones and bass amplifiers as instruments. He has honed his skills over the years to a fine art and this collaboration is his own original works, along with several of Jim's incomplete works fully realized as whole songs, with Cameron's experienced crafting.

Polluted is where these two artists have begun their musical journey together after years of talking about music together, and working on audio engineering and production for Cameron R's other projects.
