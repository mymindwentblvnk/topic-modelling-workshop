Raised in South East London but with roots that stretch back generations to Uganda, Mysie can retroactively plot the path to where she is now: making intimate indie soul that takes her listeners along with her on the journey through raw and sensitive emotional spaces. 
Mysie is signed to Frasier Smith's label, 70Hz, and together they set out to make the music you hear now: considered, intimate indie soul. The subsequent sessions produced the project Mysie feels captures the spirit and soul of what she’s long desired to make: Undertones.

Mysie’s attitude is to embrace love, live within it, and make art from it, no matter what the cost. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mysie">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
