KAPTAIN SUN was formed in the fall of 1998 from the band Clandestine. Clandestine started in 1993 with Anders Håkansson, Marcus Hamrin, Rickard Gustafsson and Martin Lindholm. At this time the bandmembers was about 13 to 16 years old and didn´t know much about life more than that alcohol was strong and that heavy metal was the coolest thing in the world. Two demos and one guitarist later, Andreas Svensson took over the heavy task as a lead guitarist in -98. Clandestine changed from being a gothic metal-band in the spirits of Paradise lost and My dying bride and started to sound more like bands such as Gorefest and Cathedral, and the name "Clandestine" did now longer fit in with the sound or the music. KAPTAIN SUN released their first official release in september 2000 on Rage of achilles records, England. The release was a six track EP called "Trip to vortex". In september 2003 KAPTAIN SUN released their debut album, "Rainbowride", just as before on Rage of achilles records. And now, 2005, KAPTAIN SUN releases their 2nd album, "Blood, rock n´ roll & black angels", on their own label, Metal Breed Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kaptain+Sun">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
