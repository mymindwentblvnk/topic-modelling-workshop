Jill Andrews is an American singer-songwriter based in Nashville, Tennessee. She was a co-founder of indie folk/alt-country band The Everybodyfields, leaving in 2009 to pursue a solo career.

Andrews picked up a guitar for the first time when she was 19; armed with only three chords, she had all she needed to create deep and soulful songs with lonesome melodies and haunting lyrics. 

In 2003, Andrews teamed up with Sam Quinn to create The Everybodyfields—it was an undeniable musical union. And the face of Tennessee’s roots music would never be the same. The Everybodyfields played Bonnaroo and Floydfest, honkytonks, bars, and theaters from coast to coast. Paste Magazine listed them in their “Best of What’s Next” issue in September 2008, saying that they “straddle old and new, bitter and sweet, desperation and transcendence with an arresting command.” Andrews took that arresting command into her solo project. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jill+Andrews">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
