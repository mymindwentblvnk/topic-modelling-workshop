Coming from Milan/Italy, Destrage represents a strong compromise between european melodic deathmetal, the best american thrash/hardcore act and rock’n’roll. An incredible mix of speed, core, sickness, alternative, and sometimes introspective tunes through melodic and killer songs.An absolute must for fans of In Flames, Soilwork, Nevermore, The Haunted, Darkane, Snot. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Destrage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
