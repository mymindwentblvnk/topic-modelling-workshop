Chima Anya was born August 30th 1986 in Bacau Romania to a Romanian mother and Nigerian father.

Having always displayed an affinity for hip-hop at an early age despite his lack of exposure to it, as he matured he actively seeked it out and soon completed his own self titled PhD in it. 

He spent the first 10 years of his life in Glasgow (giving rise to his odd accent) but only feels he became a person during his time spent in Oxford UK and thus this is where he claims to rep.

At the age of 22 he graduated as a medical doctor in England from the university of Birmingham and still works as a junior doctor in various hospitals across the U.K.

He is 1/2 of the hip-hop duo GTA. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chima+Anya">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
