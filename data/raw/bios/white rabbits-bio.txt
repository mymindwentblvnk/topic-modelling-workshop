White Rabbits is an indie rock band which formed in Columbia, Missouri, United States in 2004. The band consists of Greg Roberts (vocals, guitar), Steve Patterson (vocals, piano), Alex Even (guitar, vocals), Brian Betancourt (bass), Matt "The Duck" Clark (drums) and Jamie Levinson (drums). The band has released three albums, "Fort Nightly" (2007), "It's Frightening" (2009) and "Milk Famous" (2012).

White Rabbits came to New York from the midwest. For their first record, they managed to catch the attention of Say Hey Records and producer Chris Zane (Shy Child, Asobi Seksu, Les Savy Fav).  Their second album, "It's Frightening," was produced by Britt Daniel (Spoon).

Lead by dual vocalists, Greg Roberts (Guitar / Vox) and Steve Patterson (Piano / Vox), the 6 piece is rounded out by Alex Even (Guitar / Vox), Brian Betancourt (Bass), Matt “The Duck” Clark (Drums) and Jamie Levinson (Drums). With a certain joie de vive, playfulness and charm White Rabbits thematically evoke the more decadent and bygone era of days spent on the green, old cinemas “Tourist Trap”, tragic mothers “Navy Wives”, and restrained, but no less awkward domestic disputes, with the first single, “The Plot.”

Added to their arsenal are 3 part vocal harmonies that texture the album throughout. White Rabbits even showcase the occasional group chant, best exampled on Fort Nightly’s opening track “Kid On My Shoulders”. White Rabbits’ penchant for more tropical excursions such as on “I Used To Complain Now I Don’t”, featuring the horns of Beirut’s (Jon Natchez), are, at times, reminiscent of The Specials or Madness.

Their sets have gained the band a large and growing audience and led them to share bills with Peter Bjorn & John, The Fiery Furnaces, The Walkmen, Richard Swift and others.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/White+Rabbits">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
