Torture Wheel is a side project of the Horror Metal band Wraith of the Ropes. It is the brainchild of multi-instrumentalist E.M. Hearst and he has been the sole member of Torture Wheel throughout it's entire existence. Occasionally though, his Wraith of the Ropes band mate, Scarecrow Jack Rottinghouse, will also contribute keyboards to a song, so he could be seen as an unoffical second member of the band.

The musical inspiration for forming Torture Wheel came originally from listening to extreme "Funeral Doom" bands of the past decade, but inspiration comes from many different forms of music... doom metal, black metal, heavy metal, 70's prog & psychedelic rock, industrial, abstract / soundscape / musique concrete and so on... Torture Wheel pledges allegiance to no one genre, it is an ever evolving entity.
