#1 Rock Band from Slovakia (Nitra) 

History:

On october 1980 (the year of the monkey in chinese horoscope) Michal Cabala was born in Nitra. He started singing from his six years of age. His first band was called DDT. He played in the band with Pete Slamecka. The man that influenced him a lot later on. On april 2000 Michal become a singer in VRAK and the new history of the band started to be written. He took over the leadership in the band and gradually began to change its direction. The band, influenced by Michalâ€™s music and lyrics production, started to change its repertoire more close to melodic pop-rock and started to be more popular among the music and wide public, as well. In 2006 the members of the band decided to change their name to ALONE, what meant the definite end of the past and stepped on a new path with the aim of succeeding with their new and own production, together with recording their first professional CD. The leader of the band Michal, apart from singing and playing the guitar, writes lyrics both in Slovak and English, composes and makes music.

#2 Electronica / New Wave / Experimental band from Serbia.

typical sound of alone is a mixture of sterile and gentle. alone's dark electronic music sounds as if the 80's industrial has never happened and we still live in the monumental synthetic sound of late 79/80's METALBEAT era. alone has been active through numerous releases and performances since 1994.
