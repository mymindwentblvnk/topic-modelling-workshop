2010- present.

The band's line up is as follows: 
Amasa Harward as lead vocals
Jack Mullins as lead guitarist
Zach Roberts as rhythm guitarist
Cole Houston as bassist
Evan Bollinger as drummer

Bringing lightning quick energy, intense stage presence, crazy shows, and heavy music  to the stage Panzer is a force to be reckoned with in the underground music scene of Orange County.

It started off in 7th grade when Jack Mullins and Zach Roberts decided to play guitar. Later on in 9th grade they met Cole Houston, who just so happened to be a bass player. However, the band wasn't conceived until the summer after 9th grade, 2009, when Amasa Harward and Jack got talking outside of a Del Taco by their high school. Amasa decided he could sing and Jack went with it. That night they told Zach about the band and he went with it too. Cole Houston was quickly recruited into the band and they desperately needed a drummer. Luckily Evan Bollinger was available and was recruited into the band in a couple of weeks. 

Panzer has played numerous shows in Orange County with a variety of bands. Panzer will play any show, just call/ email them up.
