A COSMIC TRAIL is a new band founded by skilled musicians who have been part of the scene for many years. The aim was, is and will be to combine many influences to create something new and unique.

The debut album “The Outer Planes” contains emotional and powerful music, enriched with atmosphere and beauty. You won’t find any vocals and you won't yearn for them – the music says everything you want to hear! “The Outer Planes” is full of haunting and subtle melodies with many twists and turns.

Neither this is another boring instrumental album with uninspired and predictable repetitions, nor a pseudo-technical succession of intricate parts. A COSMIC TRAIL take you on a journey into Progressive Rock, Metal, 70s Music, Ambient, Folk, soundtracks and even more!
However, everything flows just naturally and invites you to indulge and dream. This is widescreen cinema for your ears! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Cosmic+Trail">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
