Corporectomy is a brutal death metal band from Germany. They formed from Christian Veltmann (Vocals)  , Jens Ballaschke (Guitars, Irate Architect, Apostasy (Ger), Lambent), Karim Dair√© (Guitars, Into Oblivion (Ger), Poostew), Awaiting The Autopsy) and Pawel (Drums, Infested) in 2008. The band plays generic slamming brutal death metal with a simple songwritting style but the band does execute with fine intensity and the styles of the twists from the stacato riffs go well with the guttural vocals and blasting drums.

The band has released their debut EP "Within the Weak and the Wounded" via Sevared Records which is in vien of such bands as Devourment, Digested Flesh, Dying Fetus and Brodequin.
