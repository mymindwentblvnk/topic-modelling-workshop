Arterial Spray formed in late 2007, playing a style of punk-influenced thrash metal dubbed, in honor of Spazz and Budweiser, "Party Violence." After playing some shows and recording an 11-songs-in-20-minutes demo, they took a brief hiatus in the latter part of 2008. Returning with a new bassist in early 2009 they have refocused their sound, taking a more brutal grindcore-leaning thrash approach with songs about such topics as Genghis Khan's neighborhood bar, barbecuing the Chupacabra and threatening kids to get off their lawn. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arterial+Spray">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
