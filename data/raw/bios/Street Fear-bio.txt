Street Fear comes from a small town in the interior of São Paulo State called Ilha Solteira, where the HC scene was always very strong and well-known, and where a lot of brazilian and foreigner bands played at. In it first line-up, the members of the band were Hildebrando (drums), Silvio Magri (guitar + vocals) and Alan (bass), making a fast sound with guttural vocals. After two months, bass player Alan left STREET FEAR for personal reasons and then Henrique “Xis” joined the band, took over the bass and introduced a new vocal, but he left the band in 2001, because he moved to the town of Jaú – SP. The band was in silence for 4 years, and now is back with Hildebrando (drums) , Silvio (guitar + vocals) and Bomba (bass + vocals). STREET FEAR always attempted to be authentic in their music, basing their sound on HC/CRUST/GRIND bands which all the members identified themselves. So, they decided to give their contribution to the brazilian underground scene. After several gigs in several cities, STREET FEAR began to be known by the public for their “anti-musical” sound and their non-conventional attitude, always struggling against the media shit and the government that devastates Brazil… If you still don’t know STREET FEAR, contact us and join the underground and the resistance against the current situation. Do NOT keep quiet, give your contribution to the scene!!! !!! ATTITUDE, REVOLT AND CONSCIENCE!!!
