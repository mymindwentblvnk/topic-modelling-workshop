A 4-piece death metal/grindcore band from Sheboygan, Wisconsin, playing obscure proto-goregrind as early as 1991. Released a demo-tape, Entering the Corpus Mass, through Headsicle Records in 1992 and split-up shortly after. Terry Walsdorf, their vocalist, would later on become a member of Forever Sleep (blackened gothic metal formed in 1996) and A Dawn Within (progressive melodic death metal formed in 2002). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Coroner+Necrophiliac">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
