Bulgarian one man NSBM project.

Formed in 2003 by Isar & a friend as a Viking Metal project, but nothing was recorded in this line-up, so in 2005 Isar started to record alone in the NS Metal style.

Paganblut also appeared on different V.A. Compilations:
"Misanthropic Spirit II" (Underground Propaganda) with the song Horst Wessel
"We Worship... Vol. 3" (A.M.F. Prod.) with the song Die braune Kompanie
"5 Years of Unholy Fire" (Sabbath's Fire Rec.) with the songs Fuck Donalds & J.York
"Vereint im Kampf" (De Profundis Prod. / Oskorei Bild Und Tonkunst) with the track "Nioy (Orig. Sram & Pozor)" (3:57) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paganblut">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
