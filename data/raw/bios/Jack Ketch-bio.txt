After only two years Sacramento, CA based metal band Jack Ketch has just released their second album Bringers Of The Dawn. Since their first release Jack Ketch has been working endlessly on perfecting their new progressive sound. Influenced by bands such as Dream Theater, Opeth  and Between The Buried And Me, they are taking the crushing riffs that brought them to the top of the local scene and adding a more matured melodic feel. Pairing this along side with new levels of technicality and an always energetic live performance, Jack Ketch is a force to be reckoned with in the progressive metal scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jack+Ketch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
