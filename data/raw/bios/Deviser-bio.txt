Deviser is a Greek black metal band playing melodic black metal with some atmospheric keyboards. In fact their sound, though it's quite recognizable on its own, can easily be described as the "Greek black metal" sound as you can found similarities to it in the sound of their countrymates Rotting Christ and a couple of other bands from the same country.

The band was formed in 1989 in Crete, Greece. In the beginning the style was thrash/death metal which would eventually evolve into black metal after the relocating to Athens in 1992.

Deviser has so far released three studio albums Unspeakable Cults (1996), Transmission to Chaos (1998) and Running Sore (2002) plus a compilation of some old demo material titled Thy Blackest Love (2003). A full-lenght album Seasons of Darkness has been recorded in 2006, but remains yet unreleased.
