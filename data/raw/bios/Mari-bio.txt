Mariâ€™s EP, Living Colored, is a soul-searching journey, in which he weaves the experiences of his childhood growing up south of Chicago, attending college in New England and working a finance job in Buffalo, NY. Successfully juggling music and a 9-5, Mari took advantage of his vacation days traveling between Chicago and NYC to record music, shoot music videos, and connect with musically minded people in order to refill his artistic spirit and vision.

After releasing his debut EP, Higher Edukation, as a college senior, Mari garnered attention amongst students in the New England college scene. With an EP under his belt, Mari has begun to carve out his space in hip-hop with soul and jubilance. Influenced by artists like Outkast, Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar, Mari strikes a balance between melody, lyricism, and production in his newest project. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mari">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
