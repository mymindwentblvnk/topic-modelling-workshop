Disincarnate is a technical death metal band formed by James Murphy, ex-Death, Obituary, Cancer, Konkhra, Testament guitarist. 

Very old-school death metal, but with intricate riffs and solos similiar to Death. There are rumors that there is going to be a 2nd album, but James is undergoing medical treatment for a brain tumor so there is no set time for a release.

There are various rumors about Deron Miller from CKY doing guest parts on the second Disincarnate album, as well as him being the touring guitarist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Disincarnate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
