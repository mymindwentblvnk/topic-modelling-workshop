Still Falling started out in April 2009. Before Marios joined the band, Zaf and Nick used to spend time together composing some songs. After Marios joined Still Falling needed a Drummer. After some searching we got a response for a Drummer, that's when Geo joined the band. Now it was time to start some rehearsing. So we did. We got some time to get together as a band because it was something new for most of us, and especially for the kind of music we wanted to play. When we all got together we started composing our own songs, and here we are! In summer 2011, Giorgos P. joined the band as the drummer. The Still Falling EP is on the making.. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Still+Falling">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
