Anal Bleeding was a Deathgrind band from Québec, Canada, active from 2001 to 2002. The band's members were Stefan Noël on Guitar, Felix-A. Rancourt on Vocals, Sébastien Lemieux (also a member of Abhorre,  Antikriist, Bakbakwalanooksiwae and Cumgun) on Drums and Christian Fortier on Bass.

The band was very well-known for its torture/pornography-centered lyrics, as well as the fact that no vocal effects were used on their only full-length recording.

Unlike most Death Metal bands of the early 2000's, Anal Bleeding managed not to limit themselves to the usual Death Metal sound, by infusing Porngrind elements into their music, while maintaining the technicallity and control of Brutal Death Metal, something very groundbreaking and innovative for the time. Their music is very reminiscent of and has indirectly influenced numerous Death Metal bands that are active nowadays.

The band's only official release is Two Cocks in the Same Hole, a full-length CD released on Ontario-based label Civilian Death Network (CDN) Records in 2002 (CDN 006/778224152828), which was preceded by a demo CDr entitled Guts out of Anus, which was self-released by the band in 2001 and limited to 100.

Unfortunately, Anal Bleeding broke up shortly after the release of their album, which was a great loss for the international Death Metal scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anal+Bleeding">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
