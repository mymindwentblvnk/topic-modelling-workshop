Abnegation was a metalcore/deathcore band from Erie, Pennsylania, USA, active from 1992 to 1999. The band began as a vision of Jason 'Iggy' Imig and Paul Nowoczynski to showcase their hardline straight-edge political views. Their lyrics and music, delivered with anger and urgency, became an altar for expressing their strong opinions on issues such as animal rights, abortion, environmentalism, and drugs. The band's musical style switched to death metal on their 1999 full-length album Verses of the Bleeding, the band broke up the same year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abnegation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
