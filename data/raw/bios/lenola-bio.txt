Lenola was an indie-rock noise-pop group formed in New Jersey in 1994, originally envisioned as a four-track project by lead man Jay Laughlin, but with the addition of guitarist David Grubb and drummer Sean Byrne, eventually became a standard band. After the addition of bassist Scott Colan, Lenola released several singles on the self-funded Tappersize label before releasing their first album in 1996. In 2001, File Thirteen Records released their fourth full-length CD, 'Treat Me To Some Life'. Their final album, the 'Sharks & Flames' double-CD, was released in 2003 in Japan and Europe but was only recently issued in the US as a digital download through iTunes. Powered by strong guitars, Lenola is generally compared to My Bloody Valentine and The Flaming Lips. In 2003 the group disbanded. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lenola">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
