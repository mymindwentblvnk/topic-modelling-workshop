Initially from Birmingham, the London-based producer and DJ Lee Gamble first emerged from the jungle scene, DJ'ing on pirate radio stations and co-founding the CYRK collective. He took his early influences to develop sound production with an experimental twist, joining the Entr'acte label and releasing the 2006 mini-album 80mm O!I!O, 2009's Join Extensions album, and a 2010 cassette with the musician Yutaka Makino. Moving to Bill Kouligas' Pan label, Gamble's deconstructed jungle album Diversions 1994-1996 appeared in 2012, followed shortly by the reverberating, techno-charged Dutch Tvashar Plumes. Both albums were highly acclaimed, and featured on The Wire and Fact magazines' year-end lists. Gamble became an in-demand DJ; for his sets, he would play house and techno or a fully vinyl jungle set from what he calls "The Golden Age of Jungle." In 2014, he developed his techno style with the EP Kuang and the full-length Koch. The B23 Steelhouse 12" followed in 2015. Gamble started a forward-thinking club label called UIQ, which issued records by artists such as Zuli, S Olbricht, and Lanark Artefax, in addition to Gamble's 2016 EP Chain Kinematics. In 2017, he signed to Hyperdub and released the abstract club album Mnestic Pressure. February of 2019 brought the EP In a Paraventral Scale, the first in a three-part series titled Flush Real Pharynx. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lee+Gamble">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
