Coughdust (est. 2010) may be a new name to the metal scene, but make no mistake, these Finns aren't strangers to their craft when it comes to the subject of creating bonecrushing heaviness. Their track record consists of past and present bands such as Rotten Sound, Deathbound, Enochian Crescent and Vomiturition amongst others.
