An electronic-rap duo featuring veteran French producer 20syl and West Coast American rapper Mr. J. Medeiros, AllttA, which stands for "A little lower than the Angels", specialize in soulful, electro-infused hip-hop built around  Mr. J. Medeiros' cerebral lyrics and 20syl's inventive beats. Founded in 2015 -- the pair have known each other since 2004 -- the duo dropped a pair of well-received EPs (Touch Down, Pt.1 and The Woods) before issuing their much-anticipated full-length debut, The Upper Hand, in February 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/AllttA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
