Antiquated technology makes Seattle's Truckasaurus unsung heroes of the lo-fi side of the crunky club techno scene. Heavy use of old Commodore 64 mods, Roland TR-808, Gameboy beats, and distorted megaphone distinguish them from most of the new comers. The Truck’s debut album, Tea Parties, Guns and Valor boasts 9 original tracks, a cover of the theme from “Airwolf,” and an array of remixes by some of the Northwest’s biggest names in electronic music: Copy, DJ Collage, and Jerry Abstract all try a hand at reworking the group’s signature sound.

The true Truck experience, however, is through their live sets. Fishing vests, trucker hats emblazoned with bald eagles, and American flags-as-capes are the fashion de rigueur for this crew, who stand in front of a projected VHS mashup of monster truck rallies, helicopter explosions, and homoerotic WWF matches.Innovative beat guru Phillip Sherburne of Consolidated refers to them in Pitchfork as "No next-level, cybernautic, telekinetic future-shock sh*t here, just cranky circuitry and a siren switch. For another, they don't really make the boompty-boompty, four-to-the-floor, capital-t Techno that's the genre's present-day signature."
