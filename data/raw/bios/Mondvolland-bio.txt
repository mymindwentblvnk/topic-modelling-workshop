Mondvolland stands for black metal with a non-typical and at times even avant garde character, combining scream, lower grunt and especially different styles of clean vocals. For live shows, energy and dedication are keywords. An upcoming full length album, as well as several other (short) releases, is expected before the end of 2013.

The lyrics bring back olden times of the birthplace of its founding members. "Mond vol land" is Dutch for "mouth full of earth" and comes from a local folk story in which giants created the hills of Montferland in Gelderland.

Having started out in 2006 by MJWW and Mickeal as a more folk-focused project, Mondvolland musical wise turned the tables completely since the release of their three song promotional EP Pestvogel in early 2012, which is free for download for everyone.
