Anubis Unbound most simply put are a straight-up metal band from the Baltimore area in Maryland. Wielding a live show packed with energy and often un-matched power, they have a great way of turning a crowds attention, and are no strangers to filling venues. The music has a range from song to song, and the composition of each is though out well and doesnâ€™t remain stagnant. Floating in between the brutal and the melodic. The epic and the emotional. Anubis Unbound ties all of these elements together to create a sound both technical and full of melody.

"The band has a wickedly biting hard sound that is a mix of black metal and traditional thrash. This mix is technically and melodically sound as a brick wall coming at your skull at 120 mph. Indeed Anubis Unbound is the immovable object of the new metal regime and will be haunting the hallows of metal's halls for quite a long time to come" 

-Moe Hillbilly 


"To the untrained ear, any metal song may seem like an endless stream of double-bass pedals, incomprehensible screaming and chugging distortion.... What Anubis brings to the table is a sort of subtle brilliance; all of the previously-mentioned factors are present here, but well-placed key switches, Plunkett's reggae and funk-inspired bass lines and ridiculously tight harmonies between Sleeth and Smith make them stand out in a scene difficult for bands to thrive in." 

-Vivi Machi / Johns Hopkins Newsletter 


"No egomaniacs, a genuine friendship, strict road rules, strong work (practice) ethics, and personal life experiences coming to life through the music and lyrics. It'll be fun to see how these guys evolve." 

-Shockwave Magazine
