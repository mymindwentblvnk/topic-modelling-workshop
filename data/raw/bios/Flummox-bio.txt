Formed in the summer of 2012 in a run down trailer by an old Tennessean highway, Flummox was born in the name of all things weird, unusual, and completely insane. The brain child of two eccentric, magician, teenaged delinquents, Alyson Blake Dellinger & Drew Jones, the duo decided to create a band with no sense of genre labels, sound restrictions, or strict musical guidelines. Flummox could be whatever they wanted it to be, and so far, it has been. With the genre of their music hopping among the sounds of heavy rock, funk, extreme metal, jazz fusion, progressive rock, avant-garde, bluegrass, power pop, to doo-wop, the band truly didnâ€™t plan on limiting the bounds of what they played to a particular demographic. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flummox">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
