Lack of Afro is the recording name of Adam Gibbons.

Born into a musical family, Adam started playing the piano at the age of 7, taking lessons from his grandmother. He started the alto saxophone at the age of 11 and had progressed to Grade 8 by the time he was 17. Musical influences at this early stage included Motown, Soul, Jazz and all forms of Sixties music, courtesy of his father’s record collection. Meanwhile when he was 15 he had been shown simple beats on the drum kit by his uncle and he then took this further by playing along to records in his lunch-breaks at school. By the time he left school at 18 Adam had also learned to play the guitar.

In July 2005 Tru Thoughts producer and DJ Flevans picked up on a funk track that Adam had written in late 2003 called “Wait A Minute”. He played it at The Big Chill to great crowd reaction. Thanks in no small part to close friend Heavy Stylus, in January 2006 the manager of Freestyle records Jon Sheppard heard “Wait A Minute” on The Root Down website. Lack of Afro was signed to Freestyle records a couple of days later.

To date Adam has played alongside and/or supported such musical luminaries as Maceo Parker, Quantic, Breakestra, The Rebirth, Flevans, The Baker Brothers and Jon Kennedy. His first single on Freestyle “Wait A Minute” has sold over 1,000 copies (no mean feat for a debut) and was played on Annie Mac’s Mash Up on BBC Radio 1, as well as countless other radio stations up and down the country. He has since completed remixes for Eddie Roberts (One Note), Tim Wood (Socialbeats) and is at the moment working on one for The New Mastersounds (One Note) and Flevans (Tru Thoughts/Jack To Phono).


Born and raised in Exeter, Devon, Adam now lives in London and works for Sky Television.
