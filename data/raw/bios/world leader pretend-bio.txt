World Leader Pretend is a five-person rock band from New Orleans, featuring Keith Ferguson (vocals/guitar/keyboards), Parker Hutchinson (keyboards), Matt Martin (guitar), Arthur Mintz (drums), and Alex Smith (bass). The band formed in 2002, and their name comes from the 5th track of the album Green by R.E.M..

Their first album, Fit For Faded was released in 2003 on Renaissance Records, a New Orleans label. After some touring with Emerge Music, the band decided to record in The Walkmen's studio in New York. The stars lined up for the bad and a bidding war ensued for World Leader Pretend resulting in the highest signing bonus since 50 Cent.  

In 2004, they were signed to Warner Bros. World Leader Pretend was given a two album deal with an option of a third. An appearance at the first annual CMJ Cleveland and a slew of North American tour dates coincided with the June 28, 2005 release of their major label debut, Punches. World Leader Pretend was also featured on the Today Show following Hurricane Katrina. The band is currently in New Orleans recording their second record under their Warner Brothers contract, their third overall. The band was recently featured stating that the new album will be much less "pop rock" and will be going in an entirely new direction. With the song writing talent of Keith Hutchinson at the helm, there is little doubt the music will continue to grow and change.
