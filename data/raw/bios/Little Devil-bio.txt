LITTLE DEVIL is an indie rock band from all over, NJ. In 2008 singer Mike Pellegrino wrote The Dusty Showbiz E.P. and recorded it at Brooklyn Love Studios with help of producer Ian Love (Rival Schools ) and Greg Morris. Years later, after sitting on the songs, he joined forces with Brandon Alboum and decided to take pictures in bed with him and they wrote some more songs together. Down the road they met two brothers named Frank Peterpaul and Anthony Peterpaul. Little Devil is now recording their next E.P. at Country Livin' Studios and will be done by late fall.
