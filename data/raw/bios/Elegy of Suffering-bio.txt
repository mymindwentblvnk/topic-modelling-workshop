Elegy Of Suffering was first conceptualized in 2008, by a group of experienced metal musicians intent on putting a fresh spin on the traditional death metal sound. Unhindered by the pitfalls of the bands tumultuous beginnings, the two musicians at the band's helm (Matt Hems and Steve Miller, the band's guitar duo) pressed continually forward, crafting songs and solidifying the sound that was to become known as Elegy Of Suffering. With a vision of combining the dark brutality and technicality of the American Death Metal scene with the structured, rhythmically memorable headbangability patented by Death Metal's Scandinavian forefathers - while remaining firmly rooted in Canada's venerable metal heritage, the band continued to churn out material, which was to be presented as the group's first recorded offering. Now, months into the recording process, the hour upon which Elegy Of Suffering will be born unto Toronto's vibrant metal scene looms on the horizon. Dark clouds gather, and the ground seemingly trembles in the anticipation of cataclysmic, creative destruction. Take cover, for an explosion of ferocity is imminent.....  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elegy+Of+Suffering">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
