Lethal Halo is a 4 piece Melodic Metal ensemble.

Formed in 2008, Lethal Halo began writing material influenced from their diverse cultural backgrounds. With members hailing from Turkey, England, Ireland and Canada, and drawing upon European Death Metal, American Thrash, Speed and Nu Metal with touches of Progressive and Power Metal, Lethal Halo has a broad palette to work with. Lethal Halo is unafraid to create music that crosses genres and blend styles to attain their musical vision.

In the fall of 2009 Lethal Halo began performing live shows for Vancouver's local metal scene.  2010 started with their self titled EP, and continued through the summer with touring in BC and Alberta.  Winter 2010 found Lethal Halo in the studio again, this time recording their first full length album, "Process of Progress"

Spring 2011 Lethal Halo journey through Western Canada on the Process of Progress CD Release Tour, their longest tour to date.  They are excited to tour again and can't wait to play for friends and fans every night.  Looking forward, Lethal Halo will enjoy a summer of performing around BC and writing new material.

Starting with a desire to create music which they enjoy, Lethal Halo has grown from humble beginnings, but has always believed in their ability to write and perform original music at a high level.  We look forward to the future with new music, new tours and new fans to share our brand of music with. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lethal+Halo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
