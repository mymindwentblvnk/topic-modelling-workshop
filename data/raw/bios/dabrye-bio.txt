Dabrye (pronounced “DAB-ree”) is just one alias of Ghostly artist Tadd Mullinix, who explores hip-hop with head-nodding beats and saw-tooth bass lines,  with a keen eye to forward-thinking production and rhythms. Dabrye has earned considerable praise from both the hip-hop underground (Jay Dee, Jurassic 5) and the electronic music press, earning him a Next 100 mention from URB in 2002 and praise from publications as diverse as Rolling Stone to The Wire.

The debut Dabrye LP, One/Three, appeared in 2002 to major acclaim and was quickly followed by Instrmntl for Scott “Prefuse 73” Herren’s Eastern Developments label. Both albums earned glowing reviews for their rhythmic innovation and minimalist execution. Dabrye began work on his next release, Two/Three, in early 2003 with the song Game Over featuring Jay Dee and Phat Kat. He also collaborated on two tracks for Prefuse 73’s One Word Extinguisher.
