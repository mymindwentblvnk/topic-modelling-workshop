Raw Black Metal, Industrial/Dark ambient band from Russia.

Lyrics focus on the Feithnathoroth philosophy (a somewhat nihilistic philosophy), and are written in Evenki language.

The band embraces the 'never stop the madness' lifestyle, and supports the use of drugs.

Gorduw, as well as Folvork Productions seems to have seized their existence. Email accounts are non-existent, and the website has not been updated in years.
