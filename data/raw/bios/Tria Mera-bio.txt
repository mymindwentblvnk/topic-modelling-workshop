For Cairns locals Juz Cook and Matt McRae, bands from Brisbane were always something to be revered. A relocation to Brisbane was a necessary step in Tria Mera's career however in order to reinforce their place in the Brisbane metal scene, they needed to ensure that each individual was not only an accomplished musician in their own right, but someone who shared the vision to drive Tria Mera forward.

The band found bassist Mike Radeck and shortly after, Ian Konrad on guitar. Upon recording their debut, self-titled EP; it was evident that they'd found a solid line-up as their fan base quickly grew. Their success was recognised in the form of a spot on the 2011 Soundwave bill and a QMusic award in the 'Heavy' category.

After amicably parting ways with the original singer Scott Moss, Tria Mera took some time in finding the missing piece of the puzzle; Ben Davis. The band didn't take this as an opportunity to slack off, they spent the time writing and rehearsing new material for their follow up EP, Extinction released in January 2014.
