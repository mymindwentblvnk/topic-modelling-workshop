"A breath of fresh air hailing out of Cincinnati. Filled with technical riffs, aggressive breakdowns, and melodic choruses; Elements presents themselves as a force to be reckoned with. They recently recorded a 3 track demo with producer Johnny Franck (former guitarist / vocalist of Attack! Attack!), and it seems that all eyes are on them as they take the scene by storm. This 5-piece metalcore band has just begun and already has so much promise, the best part is, they only have up to go from here."
