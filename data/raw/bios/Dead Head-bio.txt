Dead Head was formed April 8th 1989 in Kampen, Netherlands. On that day the four original members Tom van Dijk (bass, vocals), Robbie Woning (guitar), Ronnie van der Wey (guitar), and Hans Spijker (drums), decided to form a band and to become the most intense and brutal thrash-metal band Europe had ever seen. In the fine tradition of bands like Dark Angel, Kreator and Sadus they distilled their own way to compose songs and to make a solid impact on stage by pounding out their songs as if every minute could be their last. Especially the outrageous drum-style of Spijker, the psychotic double guitar-riffs combined with Tom's penetrating screaming gave the band a well-earned status in the metal-scene of those days. A countless number of performances throughout whole Europe sustained this, and made the band known in the metal scene all over the world. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+Head">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
