Person L is the brainchild of Kenny Vasoli, of the pop punk band The Starting Line. Vasoli is the band's lead singer, guitarist and primary songwriter; and formed Person L in winter 2006 as an outlet to explore other musical styles. The group also consists of drummers Brian Medlin and Ryan Zimmaro (previously of the band Amity), bassist Charles Schneider (previously of the band The Suicide Pact) with keyboardist and guitarist Nate Vaeth.

Vasoli initially wrote the song "Storms" while on the road with The Starting Line. Person L's debut record, Initial, was released on August 5, 2008 on Vasoli's own label, Human Interest.

During the summer of 2008, Person L went on tour with Anthony Green and Good Old War in support of their debut record. The tour consists of bands all from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, whose lead singers are from other bands that have had success. Keith Goodwin of Good Old War was formerly of Days Away and Anthony Green of Circa Survive. Following the tour with Anthony Green, Person L toured shortly with Motion City Soundtrack, followed by a tour in support of Underoath. Following that, Person L went on tour with Steel Train and spent summer 2009 touring with Mae and then Ace Enders. In 2010 they opened for Copeland on their farewell tour, also with I Can Make A Mess Like Nobody's Business. Person L's second LP, The Positives, was released on November 17, 2009 on Academy Fight Song/Human Interest.
