Emerging from southeastern Wisconsin in the fall of 2007 and establishing their name by opening for national acts such as Mindless Self Indulgence, Exposed Flesh has distinguished themselves from the music scene by bringing new elements into the mix. Their sensational live performances from this five-piece band from Racine are driven by three intense lead vocalists, an unrelenting machinegun-like drummer, and charismatic guitarist. With influences going across the board from Radiohead and Thievery Corporation to Whitechapel and Suicide Silence, Exposed Flesh brings a new and refreshing twist to a timeworn genre.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Exposed+Flesh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
