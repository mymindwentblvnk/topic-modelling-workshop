Angel Sword are a Finnish heavy metal band formed in Helsinki in 2009 by the two guitarists Jere Salonen and Sylvester Taina. The band takes its main influences from the 80's, being strongly influenced by early  NWOBHM-groups. In 2010 they released their first demo Where we are going, you cannot come, featuring Artturi Ali-Mattila, the singer-guitarist of 1 Logic, on vocals.

From their myspace:

"Awakened from their slumber by the polished plastic sound of modern metal, the heavy metal gods of old were angered; and in their fury they forged a sword of steel in a heathen fire. They saw that it was good, and it pierced the sky and shook the heavens, where it wreaked havoc until it met the iron grip of the angel in red. Electric storms swept across the earth, uniting amplifiers into one gigantic power chord that now echoes in the name of those who came before us. The purpose of Angel Sword is clear â€“ let NWOBHM be the law, dueling leads the scripture, and galloping rhythms the canon!"
