There are two bands named new flesh
[1] A St. John's, Newfoundland based powerviolence band. http://newflesh.bandcamp.com/ 

[2] New Flesh formed in 1990 but took a decade to release their first LP. They quickly gained a reputation on the UK hip hop scene.
Originally known as New Flesh For Old, their lineup included Part 2, Toastie Tailor, Horny Baker and Out Of Order. Their first single was released in 1995 on their own New Flesh Music label.
They now consist of Part 2 and Toastie Taylor alongside Juice Aleem, and are signed to Big Dada.
They released 1997's Electronic Bombardment on this label, followed by Equilibriums in 1999. Their second LP was called Understanding and was released in 2002, featuring high-profile collaborations with label-mates Roots Manuva and Ty, as well as Gift of Gab (of Blackalicious fame), Antipop's Beans and Rammellzee.
A quiet period followed, despite all three members remaining active. They returned as New Flesh in 2006 with Universally Dirty.
