Red Industry was founded in Oulu, Finland in 2003. At first the band played only covers, but it didn't take too long time before the first own song. With hard practice the band got better and more and more original songs saw the daylight.

After line-up changes the band took its current form in the summer of 2006. Red Industry recorded and released its first 5-song demo in June 2007. All songs are composed Matti Urhonen, except "Broken Mind, part II" (M. Urhonen, Janne Glad). All lyrics by M. Urhonen and Karri Kouri.
