Conceived and executed in gnarled Maine woods under a blood red moon and flickering firelights, Stoven is that rare and fearsome creature, a fully realized artistic vision untouched by the greed and mediocrity of the ‘music business’. You will not find Stoven slumming at a divebar near you, because Stoven does not play live. Instead, they convene in dark rooms and meticulously craft lumbering, psychedelic epics to twist minds and soothe rattled souls. Stoven consists of two mysterious and vaguely sinister figures: Seth Betlyon and Zachary Boyle. The less you know about them, the better, really. They began mapping this long and winding journey into the heart of darkness back in 2003; a trilogy of albums, including the ground-cracking Cigarette Dance, soon followed. Although they have, occasionally, brought their otherworldly trance-doom to the live stage, they mostly skulk and scheme and record blistering, mile-high blasts of narcotic bliss metal. As we speak, they are quietly shaping their fourth album/assault. The results, however, will be anything but quiet. --Sleazegrinder <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stoven">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
