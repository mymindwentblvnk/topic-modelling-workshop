Drown Retarded Children - A half human half machine creation that only a 15yr old prostitute could love. Formed in 2003 by two perverts determined to display the most hideous Porno-Acid-CyberGore-Grind that upstate New York would ever witness. However, keeping it imperative to always play in live venue's with a very un-venue like bastard child of a set; keeping the music chuggy and comprising insane funky grooves, has lead the band to its purpose. Making a 4 song demo, placed on the internet, from Vesper's (guitarist) 4-track, having only guitars, and insane drum programming with the multi-fashioned vocals of Baker. Essentially this lead to enough short songed shots of blasting fury to form a set that DRC toured with for 3 months. In the fall of 2003, DRC went into AGC Studios to create the filth known as Adolescent Twat Meat, DRC's first studio demo, engineered by Art Coone. In November of 2003 the two idiots were lucky enough to meet their gore and drum machine driven idols of metal... Mortician, playing as the opening band in Poughkeepsie, NY. Currently the band is in the process of creating new material for a full length record to be released by a yet to be named label (dumbasses haven't found one yet.)  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Drown+Retarded+Children">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
