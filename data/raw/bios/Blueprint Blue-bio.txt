Blueprint Blue is a British band from south London.

As members of experimental band S.C.U.M., drummer Melissa Rigby and bassist Huw Webb could too often be found surrounded by negative critiques, whether due to their similarity to The Horrors (featuring Huw’s brother Rhys) or the press that came with frontman Thomas Cohen’s relationship with the late Peaches Geldof. Their latest project sees them join forces with vocalist Elliot Hayward for music with a little less experimentation and a little more grit. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blueprint+Blue">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
