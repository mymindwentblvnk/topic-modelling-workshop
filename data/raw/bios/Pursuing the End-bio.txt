Pursuing The End was born in Parma (Italy) in 2010. The band fastly arose to the attention of critics and public with the first demo-EP "Dawn Of Expiation", featuring songs like "Followers Of The Wrong Way" and "Dawn Of Expiation", which were later included in compilations like Kill City (USA) and MondoMetal (Italy).

Starting as a pure gothic/symphonic metal but rapidly evolving into something more difficult to label. The music of Pursuing The End, while retaining a heavy use of the orchestra and choir, is a constant meeting of opposites: the six-piece itself brings together different musical backgrounds ranging from classical to rock, from electronic music to extreme metal. As a further trait of uniqueness, the band since the very beginning featured several guest musicians not belonging to the metal scene, like Enrico G. Iori (bass), Eugenio Masino (tenor) and Paolo Furlani (composer and choir conductor). After a period of intense live activity, the band entered the studios again to record two more songs for the single "Withering", featuring the historical choir Corale Verdi from Parma under the direction of M. Silvia Rossi, as well as Federica Gatta (solo soprano).

Now, as the band is working on the first full-lenght album, another guest appearance unfolds: Pursuing The End will be working with the italian actress and singer Ottavia Fusco, who will participate in some future projects, creating a new synergy between arts of different kind and form.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pursuing+The+End">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
