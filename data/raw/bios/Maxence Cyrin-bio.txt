MAXENCE CYRIN is a classically trained French pianist currently residing in Paris. His latest album 'Modern Rhapsodies' is homage to electronic music. Maxence, accompanied only by his piano, has restyled 'Windowlicker' from Aphex Twin, 'Behind The Wheel' from Depeche Mode, 'Unfinished Sympathy' from Massive Attack, 'Smokebelch II' from Sabres Of Paradise and even 'Acid Eiffel' from Choice - one of Laurent's Garnier alter-egos. Indeed the latter runs the F Com label and with this album he has his first 100% acoustic release. What's so remarkable is the melodic richness of these classic dance tracks. The result is all the more impressive if you know that no musical scores exist for these tracks. Maxence had to note everything based on 'ear and feeling'. His versions are purified, but rhythmic. Perfect music quiz material in any case. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maxence+Cyrin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
