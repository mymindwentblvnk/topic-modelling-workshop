There are two bands called Schraapstaal.

One band that's called Schraapstaal plays power metal. Somewhere in 2004, 2 guys named Leon (singer/guitarist) and Evert (guitar) wanted to start a Power Metal band. They wanted to make Power Metal like Power Metal should sound like, so they approached their classmate Robin (bass), and started looking for a drummer. But unfortunately, due to different interests, Evert left the formation, so Leon and Robin had to gather a band to get this thing going. Evert had named the not-yet-existing band "Schraapstaal" (Scraping Steel), named after a small tool used for making jewelry, and eventually found a keyboardplayer, Koen (keys, synth,samples), and Pim (drums), and started jamming. After the first practice session, Cry Your Name was born, the first song Schraapstaal made. Many other songs followed.

They recorded a demo in March 2006, which was mixed and mastered in September 2006. You can listen to the songs on this MySpace Profile (www.myspace.com/schraapstaalheerscht).
