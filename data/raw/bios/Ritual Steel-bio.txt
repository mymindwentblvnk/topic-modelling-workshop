Traditional heavy metal from Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Formed in 2001. After releasing their second full-length Blitz Invasion, the drummer Martin Zellmer left the band. As Zellmer had rights to the band name, the remaining four members went on to form a new band Titan Steele.

Zellmer has since revived the band with a new line-up and released a new album, Invincible Warriors.
