Matthias Richter was born in Germany in 1988 where he still lives and works. As a teenager he discovered his passion for music and started DJing in 2005. He founded the project Tujamo and started producing in 2006. At the age of 18 he won a DJ contest in one of the most famous clubs in Germany (Club Index, Schuttorf) where he started as a resident DJ in 2007. He is widely regarded as one of the most talented Newcomers in Germany and played in most of all major clubs and cities across the country.

High demand also comes from the international arena. In addition to performances in Australia, Brazil, Turkeye and Russia this year he had his first tour in South America. Not only his successful remixes for Bob Sinclar, Wynter Gordon, Peter Gelderblom, DubVision and the remix of the famous Laserkraft3D “Nein Mann”, also his own tracks draw attention to him: “How We Roll” “Do It All Night” and “Back 2 You” have been at the top of the charts.
