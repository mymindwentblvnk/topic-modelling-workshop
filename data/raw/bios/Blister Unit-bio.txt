Blister Unit is a grind band from Prescott, AZ.
We play sludgy grindcore with hints of black metal, death metal, punk, power violence, crust, doom, and whatever else we feel like. 
2007/2008 - Blister Unit formed in a garage in SoCal by Mike and Chris as a drum machine project.
2009/2010 - Chris moves to Arizona, we continue making grind through the internet.
2011/2013 - Mike moves to Arizona, we start trying to find members but give up and decide to just use the drum machine. We proceed to play a series of packed house shows and empty bars.
2014 - Adrian and Rani join, at long last were a full band. Now were gonna tour the US and then the world! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blister+Unit">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
