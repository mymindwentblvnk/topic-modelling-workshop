Artist Bio Modal_close_icon

Sami Anttila is a finnish solo artist and a producer. He has been releasing music as a solo artist since 2002. First demos were guitar instrumentals following the footsteps of known solo guitarists. Learning different vocal techiques made it possible to expand his range beyond instrumental music.

After releasing several singles, demos and EPs Sami released his debut album. The album consists of five new tracks and remakes of the previosly released songs. Writing, recording and mixing of the album was a long process. At one point it seemed that the release would never be finished due to heavy external workload. But after a short break the recordings were finally finished in few sessions and material was ready for the editing.
