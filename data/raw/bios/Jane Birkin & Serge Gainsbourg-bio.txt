The duo Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg is best known for the international smash "Je t'aime... moi non plus" from 1969. This erotic song was the first foreign language record to hit #1in the UK.
The song was banned by broadcasters in Spain, Sweden, Brazil as well as Britain and was condemned across the world as immoral, not least by the Vatican. It was so saucy that original co-vocalist Brigitte Bardot refused to approve its release. Scandalous singer Serge Gainsbourg soon found a 'willing partner' in British Jane Birkin. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jane+Birkin+&+Serge+Gainsbourg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
