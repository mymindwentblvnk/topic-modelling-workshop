The foundations of the Norwegian Metal band CYNICON were laid in 1996 when Cyon and Ellien formed the atmospheric Black Metal group SOLEMN, consisting of Ellien and Cyon on guitar and vocals, Paul Mozart Bjørke on bass and Øyvind Minsaas on. Drums. SOLEMN's lifespan lasted until the year 2000 when Bjørke was replaced by Cymetic and Minsaas by a drum machine. The band then took a new musical direction and a whole new name with it. They became CYNICON; a more straightforward Black Metal band with a futuristic approach to their music.

Within the spring of 2001 Cyon, Ellien and Cymetic recorded their first demo as CYNICON. After receiving positive feedback from several labels, they added some keyboards and electronic elements to their music and made a second demo with which they finally sealed a deal with Spikefarm Records.

Before the recordings of their debut album could begin, Ailorn and Mecon were added to the line-up. With Ailorn playing the keyboards and Mecon finally giving life to the drums, the making of "Cybernetic" was commenced at Oslo's Zenithstudio between May and August 2003.

Cymetic - Bass
