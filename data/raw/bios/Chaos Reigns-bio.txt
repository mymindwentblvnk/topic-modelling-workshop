1. Youngstown Ohio CHAOS REIGNS

Born out of Youngstown Ohio and a love for all things Metal, Chaos Reigns came to breathe their unique brand of Thrash into the modern scene. Composed of members of various accredited music schools including Dana School of Music at Youngstown State and Berklee College of Music in Boston, this group possesses the chops to do some serious damage to your ears. 
Drawing influence from seminal bands of Metalâ€™s yesteryear as well as many of the artists they spawned, Chaos Reigns pays homage to and evolves the sound of many classic bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Pantera, and Iron Maiden just to name a few. 
Currently touring to support their upcoming EP, and leaving satisfied Metal-heads in their wake, Chaos Reigns wants to bring its onslaught of sonic Armageddon to your town!

2. Chaos Reigns are a hard-hitting hardcore band from London, who since their formation in early 2017 have begun gigging often and are rising up in the London hardcore scene, thanks to their hectic live shows and dynamic stage presence.
