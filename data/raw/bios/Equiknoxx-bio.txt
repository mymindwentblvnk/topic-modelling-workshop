Equiknoxx is a collective of Jamaican producers and vocalists, known for their uniquely futurist take on Jamaican Dancehall.   

The project started in 2005 as Equiknoxx Music (a.k.a. Equiknoxx Musiq) being a label that was primarily producing for other vocalists. Shanique Marie and Kemikal were two of those vocalists, with Gavsborg  (real name: Gavin Blair) and Bobby Blackbird (real name: Nicholas Deane) doing the production. Around 2009 Gavsborg met producer Time Cow  (real name: Jordan Chung), after which Equiknoxx gradually became more than just a label. 

The collective gained international recognition with the release of their 2016 debut album "Bird Sound Power" , the title referring to a common resource, processed "bird sounds". The album contains various instrumental tracks and versions of tracks featured on previous EPs. "Bird Sound Power" was followed by the albums "Col√≥n Man" (2017), "Eternal Children" (2019) and the 2021 mix-tape "Basic Tools".

In a 2022 interview Gavsborg stressed that the notion of Equiknoxx being essentially himself and Time Cow running the project with the other artists rendered merely ancillary instead of equal is a misconception: "It's not like me and Time Cow are these two head honchos... I might make a little check in. As musicians, we can sometimes keep ourselves to ourselves. But it's not a check in with demands. It's more like, 'What are you up to?' "

In 2022 Gavsborg and Time Cow released the album "Writings Ov Tomato" as Gav & Jord . <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Equiknoxx">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
