Uwharria were a self described "eco-thrash" band based in North Carolina. They featured ex-members of Oi Polloi, Blownapart Bastards, Facedowninshit, Rent America and Divide & Conquer. They are named after their local ecosystem and are all environmental activists. "All songs are a glorification of nature" with topics including: "skunks, woodpeckers, sea turtles, dung beetles, being devoured by a jaguar, etc." The music itself can be described as crossover, blending influence from both thrash metal and punk. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Uwharria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
