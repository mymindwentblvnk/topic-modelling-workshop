The musical equivalent of having hot liquid shit spewed in your face @ 90 mph.

Vesication was created by Chris of Incinerated / ex-Serene Molestation,
and Eddie of Obliviated / Incinerated in the fall of 2008.
Shortly thereafter Phil 'Fetus' Baker of Blastomycosis joined the
ranks and the onslaught of drunken gore soaked pissshitting brutality began.
The current shit you're listening to on the page is rough versions of tracks
to be re-recorded for a demo that will be released by the end of the year.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vesication">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
