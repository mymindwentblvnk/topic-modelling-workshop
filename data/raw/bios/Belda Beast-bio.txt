Belda Beast formed in the Winter of 2006 in Redding, CA. Following endless hours in the basement, the quintet ventured out amongst the masses. In 2007 the band released their first LP, “As One Wakes The Night”, produced by Paul Albert Harper (History Invades, Soft Crest) and performed extensively throughout Northern California. On April 3, 2008 Belda Beast performed their final show at Cafe Coda.

After a five year hiatus, Belda Beast released their self titled ep on May 25th 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Belda+Beast">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
