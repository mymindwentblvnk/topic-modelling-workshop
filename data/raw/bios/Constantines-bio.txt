Constantines were formed in Guelph, Ontario in 1999 but first relocated to London, Ontario and then to Toronto in 2001.  They originally formed as a quartet but added keyboardist Evan Gordon in 2002 who left soon after to pursue his own song writing.  The current lineup consists of Bryan Webb and Steve Lambke on vocals and guitar, Dallas Wehrle on bass, Will Kidman on keyboards and Doug McGregor rounding out the quintet on drums.  

They released their first three full length albums, Constantines, Shine a Light and Tournament of Hearts on the Canadian label Three Gut Records. Following the demise of that label in 2007 they released their fourth album, Kensignton Heights on the Arts and Crafts label in the spring of 2008.  Outside Canada they are on the Sub Pop label.    <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Constantines">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
