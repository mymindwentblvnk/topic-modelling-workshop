Noah released his first album, Among The Wildest Things, in August 2013.  It's available on iTunes and is well worth a purchase... go check it out!  He funded the creation of this album by asking for pledges on Indiegogo - his $15,000 target was smashed and he raised over $39,000; which just goes to demonstrate how many fans he's acquiring and it's all down to his great personality, amazing voice and enviable musical talent.
