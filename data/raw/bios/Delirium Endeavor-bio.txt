Delirium Endeavor is a technical metal band from Rochester NY that formed in 1998. Their music incorporates technical rhythmic changes with epic melodies, resulting in complicated song structures. Recently the band acquired Arie Itman (ex-Quo Vadis singer, guitarist and violinist) for vocals and are currently in the middle of recording their follow-up to their 2004 instrumental album "Twelve Cusp", entitled "Diagenes at Delphi".

Current line-up:

Jim Tasikas - Guitars
Ed Paulsen - Bass
Arie Itman - Vocals
Jody Roberts - Drums (only for the recording)
