Hell United is what transmutated out of Eclypse. The band Eclypse
was created around 1997 and in winter of 1999 it recorded its first bits
promoted by a two-track demo called “Omen”. Unfortunately,
the remaining tracks were never released. After the broadly acclaimed,
succesful demo found its way in the metal underground, the band
started playing gigs. After some changes in the line up in winter 2002/2003
the band recorded its full fledged material “Applause – Ihvh elohim met”,
which gained numerous positive reviews. The material was released by
a young publishing company RedRum666, but the contract passed on into
oblivion. After the release of “Applause…” Eclypse played a few more live
gigs, but problems with some inner problems made it impossible for the
band to play any longer, and the band Eclypse suspended its activity,
until the band regrouped in 2006 and started working on new material
taking up the name of Hell United. The name emphasizes the determination
and new energy towards making music, as well as the experience
of the band members, who have not lost their identity. It all led to a new
demo release called „Extra-Strenght of the Obscure” which was released
by the French Gorification Musix together with a re-release of “Omen”.
Currently the band is preparing to enter a studio and record the remaining
tracks being a continuation of their latest demo release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hell+United">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
