Kotkee are Daniel Detail and Tiiu.
Both have some history in drum'n'bass but have done this side project which is more 2-step/future-garage/electronica. Their cover version of the XX's 'Angels' was a stunning tribute. Their first EP for Kokeshi is out 28 June via all fine retailers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kotkee">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
