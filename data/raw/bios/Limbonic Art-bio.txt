Limbonic Art is a symphonic black metal band, which is heavily influenced by orchestral-classical music. 

Limbonic Art was formed in 1993 in Norway, and for a short while existed with a 4 member line-up. Before any material was released the band became a 2 piece, and have stayed that way for their entire existence. The two members going under the monikers of Daemon (Vidar Jensen) and Morfeus (Krister Dreyer). Throughout 1995 and 1996 they recorded two tapes, one rehearsal tape and one official promo tape. This caught the attention of the label Nocturnal Art Productions (owned by Samoth of Emperor and Zyklon fame). In 1996 the band released their debut, "Moon in the Scorpio".

Mixing in atmospheric elements with harsh black metal the band gained a large underground following. As they progressed through their career their albums became less symphonic and more orientated on pure Black metal. But they never lost touch of their symphonic roots, continuing to infuse their music with keyboards. Throughout their existence they got criticism for using an electronic drum computer. The fans of the band were however not bothered by this.

In 1998 they released some of their early demo material. The material was fully re-recorded and released under the title 'Epitome of Illusions'. On which the band also thanked their fans for their support throughout the years. 

in 2000 Samoth formed Zyklon and invited Daemon to perform vocals on their first album and several live gigs, including Mystic Festival in Poland in 2001, after which Daemon left due to personal reasons and lack of time to go on tour.

In February of 2003 the band broke up. However Daemon and Morpheus announced the reforming of Limbonic Art on 2006.
