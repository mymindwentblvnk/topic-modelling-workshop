Wargore was born in Vicenza, Italy in 2002. Founded by Vanny (Mortifier, Cerebra Infest, Necrotorture) and Andrea (guitarist in Bleeding Eyes). Initially, the line up was composed of Vanny on drums, Andrea on guitar and Luca on the bass. Their objective was to continue the road taken by Cerebra Infest, a brutal Death Metal band formed from Vanny and Luca. Maurizio joined the formation as the Insane singer of the Assholes in 2002. Little after Luca left the band, bassist Leolang Wild singer of the Mind Wild, replaced him. As a result, the band decided to change their proper name from Criminal Psychosis to WarGore. They recorded their first album, ``Decadence of Benevolence`` near the Nobrain studios of Zianigo (VE) in 2003. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wargore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
