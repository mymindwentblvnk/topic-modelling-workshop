Named after the Fleetwod Mac/ Peter Green song about money and the devil, Manalishi were formed in London, 1999, by singer Alx Norden and guitarist PJ Norman. The rest of the band included Gino Santilli (1999-2003) on guitar, Rupert Dejonghe on bass and Jimmy Norden on drums. They released 3 E.P.s (Lo-Fi Brit Noise/ 42/ Running Machine), two of which were recorded at the legendary Foel Studio in Wales.

During their evolution the irony of their name became apparent as the group refused to conform to a commercial model. Despite much critical acclaim, including Green himself, the band parted ways in 2004. Members went on to play in various UK based acts, including Ice Cold In Alex, Death By Sadie, tKatKa, and Lazy Habits. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Manalishi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
