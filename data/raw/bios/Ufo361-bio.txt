Through his gang, he met the rapper Said, who brought him to his label Hoodrich in 2010. Together with Said and producer KD-Supier, he formed the trio Bellini Boyz. After an EP with the trio, Ufo361's first solo EP Bald ist dein Geld meins was released in 2012.

In 2014, his debut album Ihr seid nicht allein was finally released via the Hoodrich label. After the album, Said and he went their separate ways. After rumours that he was to join Haftbefehl's Azzlackz label, he began releasing his music on his own. September 2015 saw the release of the video Ich bin ein Berliner, which became a scene hit. Thanks in particular to viral distribution by hip-hop artists such as Fler, the 187 Strassenbande and the Azzlackz camp around Haftbefehl, Ufo361 became popular without being signed to a major record company. In addition, Ufo361 was brought on stage at a performance by the 187 Strassenbande in Berlin's Columbiahalle to perform his scene hit together with them. In spring 2016, the mixtape Ich bin ein Berliner was released, which reached number 57 in the German album charts. The sequel Ich bin 2 Berliner followed in autumn 2016, reaching number 13. On 28 April 2017, his mixtape Ich bin 3 Berliner was released. In the same month, Ufo361 founded his own label Stay High. On 13 April 2018, his studio album 808 was released, which featured a previously unknown sound from Ufo. The album charted at No. 1 in the German and Austrian album charts. On 17 August 2018, his fifth album VVS was released, which for the first time included English-language features (Quavo, Rich the Kid).[18] VVS landed at No. 2 in the German album charts and at No. 1 in Austria. On 25 July 2018, Ufo361 stated via Instagram that he was ending his active music career after VVS, the reason being mainly his family.

On 17 March 2019, he released Pass auf wen du liebst, ending his musical abstinence. This was previously evident on Instagram, as videos of album productions were uploaded there. He also shared there that he was coming back with a new album called Wave. With this album he reached number 1 in the German charts. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ufo361">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
