The Mungolian Jet Set have landed! After a four-year journey through time and space, Paul “Strangefruit” Nyhus, Reidar Skar and their crew have returned, bringing many treasures back for the less adventurous to savour. 

The album begins with the burning rush of re-entering the atmosphere, hurtling towards the grounding of a beat beneath dualing keyboards, before relaunching through alien rapping, raunchy hard blues, Milesian jazz, atmospheric terror mixed with Zappaesque dry humour, manic DJ spins 
through the world of an Anime demon-cherub, ending with a return to the placid Earth. Our eyes have seen more through sound than we ever wouldhave thought possible. 

This is a journey not just into sound, but a journey somewhere many "intelligent dance music" producers forget exists: The Mungolian Jet Set journey into MUSIC.
