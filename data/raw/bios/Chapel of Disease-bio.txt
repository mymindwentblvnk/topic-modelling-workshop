Chapel of Disease is a death metal band from Cologne (NRW), Germany. 

In which they play  ridiculously filthy and rotten death metal in the vein of Asphyx, early Pestilence, early Gorguts and Morgorth. With fast banging riffs and slow doomy sections the band play a varied style of death metal which should have any fan of old school death metal foaming from the mouth. With a vocalist who sounds like Martin Van Drunen, Chapel of Disease wouldn't have sounded out of place in the Dutch death metal scene of the late 80's/early90's <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chapel+of+Disease">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
