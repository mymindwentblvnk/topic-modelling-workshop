Hurd (Mongolian: Хурд, "speed") is a Mongolian heavy metal band. Formed in 1993 by drummer Dambyn Ganbayar in the wake of the democratic revolution in Mongolia, Hurd is considered the first band to have introduced the heavy metal genre into the mongolian music landscape. Along with Chingis Khaan, Kharanga or Niciton, they are considered "veterans" of the mongolian pop rock scene, and, as such, they have greatly contributed to its diversification and encouraged the emergence of many new rock acts.

Hurd has released six studio albums, three live albums, and one compilation album. The band has won numerous Pentatonic Awards (Mongolia's equivalent of the Grammy Award) and Golden Microphone Awards. Guitarist Dambyn Otgonbayar is a member of the Pentatonic Academy.

In November 2009, singer Dambyn Tömörtsog and bassist Namsraijavyn Naranbaatar were respectively awarded with the Merited Artist of Mongolia and the Polar Star awards.
