Multiple sources scrobble under the name GQ, including the following:

1. A 1970s funk and disco group from the Bronx.
2. An Oakland, CA hip hop artist on producer 9th Wonderâ€™s Jamla record label.
3. A women's barbershop and a cappella quartet also known as Girls Quartet.
4. An underground Dirty South rapper from New Orleans.
5. Podcasts from the men's fashion magazine.

1. A Bronx group that effectively mixed East Coast disco and Chicago soul covers in the late '70s and early '80s, GQ began as Sabu & the Survivors in 1968. Lead vocalist Emanuel Rahiem Leblanc, Keith Crier, Herb Lane, and Paul Service were original members, but by 1980 GQ was a trio following Service's departure. They had two Top 10 R&B and Top 20 pop hits, as well as a number one R&B single in 1979, with "Disco Nights (Rock-Freak)" also peaking at #12 pop; the single also won GQ an American Music Award. Their remakes of the Billy Stewart classics "I Do Love You" and "Sitting in the Park" were number five and number nine R&B singles in 1979 and 1980 respectively, with "I Do Love You" also reaching number 20 pop. They enjoyed one other Top 30 R&B single in 1981, "Shake." All their hits were on Arista from 1979 to 1982.
