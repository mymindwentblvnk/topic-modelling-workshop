The band ATTACK OF RAGE came into existence during the year 2001. During that time this metal band was called THE CHLIEW and the first members were: BEBO - guitar, LUKÁŠ - vocal, HOYAS - drums, MAREK - second vocal. The band in this formation played at the few concerts but never issued own record. After the period of time THE CHLIEW lost one member. MAREK left from the band and three rest members still made the new songs. Then continued pause which was for the "future" ATTACK OF RAGE very important!!! After this pause began the personnel changes when the band THE CHLIEW acquired two new members: second guitar player P.T.R and the second vocal - singer STEBLO, but the most important thing is that the band called THE CHLIEW was renamed to ATTACK OF RAGE. The "new band" started to make the new songs and the things associated with this music band suddenly "moved off"!!! This new formation recorded the first demo - record, which was recorded in band's garage but this demo - record heard only a small group of the people. Then left from the band the second vocal - singer STEBLO and the formation called ATTACK OF RAGE played with these four members: BEBO - guitar, P. T. R. - guitar, LUKÁŠ - vocal, HOYAS - drums After the period of time this formation recorded the first promo CD in collaboration with the musical studio called Package. Then came new guy called PIZO, which is played bass - guitar and the circle of changes was suddenly closed. We have to say that we are waiting for something what will come in the near future!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Attack+of+Rage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
