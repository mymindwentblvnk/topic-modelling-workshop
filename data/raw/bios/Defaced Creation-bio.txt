Defaced Creation was a Swedish death metal band from Ã–stersund, Sweden. The band formed under the name of Unorthodox back in 1993. They changed their name to Defaced Creation because there already existed a band with the name Unorthodox. They released one full length album "Serenity In Chaos" before splitting up. After the split-up four of the members formed a band in 1999 called Aeon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Defaced+Creation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
