Bay Area born Marc David Barrite aka Dave Aju is a reliable name for fresh and distinctive electronic music, combining deep knowledge and passion for dance music history with a fearless, forward-thinking approach to production and performance. A diverse range of influences from his jazz upbringing and hip-hop years, to the outer realms of experimental post-rock and musique concréte can be heard in Aju’s unique sound, always with a solid sense of rhythm owed to his roots as a dancer.
