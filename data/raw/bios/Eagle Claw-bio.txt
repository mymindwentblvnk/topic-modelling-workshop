Weighing in at 700 pounds, two guitars, a bass and drums, Austin, Tx’s instruMetal outfit EAGLE CLAW is; Matt Rade, Michael Gonzalez, Luther Smalls and Bart Butler.  Formed in the fall of 2007, the band started gaining momentum quickly when their Demo “Bastard Usurper” first infiltrated Austin’s music scene. This was followed up by their first  official release entitled “Poacher”, which features 9 tracks that propels the listener through a dualistic soundscape of the void and the light.

     As it stands, the band predominantly shreds the Texas area, but is currently scheduling their next tour for April of 2011.
