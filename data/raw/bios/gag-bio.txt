1. GAG is a hardcore band from Olympia Washington. 

2. Gag formed in 1991. Rehearsed in a church hall in Flitwick, Bedfordshire. In 1992 we recorded 8 songs for a 7" EP which John Peel played muchly. Got a Peel session in 1993. Released another record on Hemiola in 1994. Played some gigs with God Is My Co Pilot, amongst others. In 1995 released a split 7" with aforementioned God Co on Guided Missile records. Later that year the British Council paid for us to do two exceedingly drunken fiascos of gigs in Budapest. Fell asleep for three years. Came back with a CD single and a CD album which we released ourselves and give away for free. Sod your MP3s, now that's subversive. Now we muddle on in a state of utter indifference to just about everything.
