There is more than one artist with this name.

(1) Bison [Vancouver, Canada] (Known as Bison B.C.)
When Bison took its first step amps were scorched and drums were smashed. Born of the ashes of seminal Vancouver skate-thrash band S.T.R.E.E.T.S., Bison are every head banger's dream. Their riffs are colossal and flow like a mighty river into a sea of fuzzed out shredding. Their message is punk rock angst and revolution, with the occasional nod to white wizards, the king of swine and a mythical beast called the "Stokasaurus". For their debut album Earthbound they've managed to capture their massive live sound on tape with the help of Jesse Gander (The Hive). In a perfect world Bison will be playing with High On Fire at your favorite dive bar, all of your friends will be there and a beer will cost a quarter. By the end of their set their amps will be in a ruined heap on top of the drum kit and somebody will be bleeding. It better be you
