STEEL HORSE was created in Madrid in June 2007 by the hand of Willy Gascon (guitars, ex-Dead End Road). Immediately, Jorge Cortes (Vocals ex-Dead End Road) and Ricardo (Drums, ex-Opus Dead and singer in Calibre Zero) joined the band. The rehearsals began in July, with the entrance of Javier Endara (vocals in Wild) in the band at the end of the year. The first show of the band was on January 20th 2008 at Gruta 77.

STEEL HORSE plays N.W.O.B.H.M. heavy metal style, and as you can imagine and listen, their principal influences are Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Accept...

During February 2008 they recorded our first demo "Raise your fist EP", which took them playing many gigs, including the METALCOVA FEST, opening for BattleRoar and Avenger, and the HALLOWEEN METAL MEETING in Belgium.

Before recording the first album in March 2009 they introduced a bass guitar: Angel Muñoz aka: "Choco" (guitar and vocals in Nigromante).

The band released his debut album called "Wild Power" in November 13th 2009.

After the release of the album, the band got a new drummer: Ruben Salvador aka: “Burren” (ex-Misantropolis).

In December 13th 2009, the band plays their first gig in Greece. The place is Athens, with the Hellenic bands BATTLEROAR and Crusade of Steel.

In March 2010, STEEL HORSE begins their first national tour, playing in 18 cities of Spain in first term, including some festivals like “Metal Bats fest II”, with Zarpa and the N.W.O.B.H.M. legend CLOVEN HOOF.

Next big dates for STEEL HORSE are May 29th and August 12th 2010, when the band will be playing at “GINETAROCK” and “LEYENDAS DEL ROCK”, big festivals in Spain, with PICTURE, TIGERS OF PANG TANG, LIZZY BORDEN, and legends of the Spanish metal scene like SARATOGA, MEDINA AZAHARA, OBUS, MURO, BARON ROJO…
