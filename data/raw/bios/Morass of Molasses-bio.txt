‘Enough bowel quaking low-end to fill another Sabbath album’ - Kerrang

'Both alluring and luring' - BBC Introducing

Like a thick stew....
Rich with blues, heavy on entry and mellow in aftertaste. A recipe born of tradition, with many a familiar ingredient. Chunky, Hearty and satisfying.

Morass Of Molasses are Swamp master generals of the Reading scene; creating the kind of lumbering Heavy blues riffs which induce involuntary head nodding and a deep stirring of the loins.

Effortlessly establishing themselves as a force to be reckoned with. Their short life so far has also seen them sharing stages with such luminaries of the scene as Crowbar, Orange Goblin, Ohhms, Vodun, Elephant Tree, Desert Storm, Space Witch, Sea Bastard, Limb, Gurt and many more. Their gutsy Jagermiester stage performance at Bloodstock 2015 helped propel them into a relentless schedule of touring. During which they released the self-funded debut EP ‘So Flows Our Fate’. Which garnered a tidal wave of critical acclaim and brought them into contact with Hevisike Records. The very Label which will be released their debut Album ‘These Paths We Tread’ May 2017. Closely followed by a momentous performance to a packed Sophie Lancaster Stage at Bloodstock Festival 2017. The new year looks set to continue the upward trend with Desertfest London 2018 and HRH Stoner vs Doom already confirmed.
