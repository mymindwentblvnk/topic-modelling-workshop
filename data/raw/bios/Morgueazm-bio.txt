Morgueazm was formed mid 2001 by ex-Blood Money members Gramie Dee and Brett Avok. Blood Money was a fairly successful UK underground thrash metal band between 1985 and 1987 releasing two albums on the Ebony Records label, 'Red Raw and Bleeding' (1986) and 'Battlescarred' (1987). The band gained a respectable fan base by touring and gigging, and Blood Money is still remembered today as a part of the NWoBHM. When Gramie created an official web site for Blood Money in early 2001 he and Brett were amazed at the response from old fans everywhere, receiving e-mails from as far as Spain enquiring if another album would be released. Because it was not possible to reform Blood Money with the original line-up, it was decided to form a new band and Morgueazm was born. A band that draws upon it's influences of thrash metal, but also injects elements of death and techno to give a fresh and different sound. Dark Mark completes the line up on bass and keyboards.
