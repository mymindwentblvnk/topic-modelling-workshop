2011-2013
Angew was formed in 2011 as a solo project of Rodolfo Ciuffo. During that period released 3 demos and later a single with 2 songs from them. The style was a sort of inexperienced raw black metal with shoegaze influences.

2014-
After a short split-up Angew was reformed as a band, with the entrance of three new members: Stefano Allegretti (guitar), Jacopo Pepe (guitar), Giuliano Belli (bass).The music evolved into a melancholic post-rock with some metal elements. The first "serious" EP release from Angew was completed in 2014 and it's called "Resonance".
