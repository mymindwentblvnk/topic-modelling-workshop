Lost Midas is the alter ego of Boston born Jason Trikakis, who first established himself as a hip hop drummer throughout his teens and into his â€˜20s. 

Mastering a range of instruments along the way (including his current favourite, the keys), he gradually developed an obsession with composition and the endless possibilities within the realm of electronic production. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lost+Midas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
