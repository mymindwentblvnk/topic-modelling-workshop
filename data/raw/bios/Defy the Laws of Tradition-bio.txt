DTLOT is a metal/hardcore combo from Nuernberg (South-Germany).
They combine the best essences of various acts of their genre - e.g. Unearth, Killswitch Engage, Every Time I Die or Pantera - to achieve a really characteristic and diversified sound.
Their debut-EP "... a Prologue" was released in 2007 (Plane Records) and is soon to be followed by a full-length effort.
