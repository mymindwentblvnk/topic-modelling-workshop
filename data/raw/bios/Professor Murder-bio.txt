In 2006, Professor Murder released Professor Murder Rides the Subway, their debut EP on Kanine Records.  Recorded at Brothers Studio with brothers Joshua Ryan, formerly a techno producer, and Eric Emm, formerly of Don Caballero, the album synthesizes Professor Murder's varied influences in a manner that sounds simultaneously cohesive and refreshingly new.

Fans of post punk, dancehall, go-go, dub and techno will find familiar elements throughout these songs, as well as new sounds and rhythms. While the album has drawn comparisons to contemporaries such as Tussle, LCD Soundsystem, and Liars, as well as to older post-punk bands such as Liquid Liquid, Talking Heads, Konk, and A Certain Ratio, it will resonate with anyone who appreciates energetic, challenging, rhythmic sounds.
