Oceanborn is a progressive metal band from Chicago, IL, USA formed by Christopher Lee, Dominick Camillo & Lance Ferrell in 2010. Since the formation Oceanborn has released 1 album and amassed a significant amount of great album reviews comparing the bands sound and musicianship to the likes of dominating rock bands such as Dream Theater, Avenged Sevenfold, Coheed & Cambria and Muse.

The band's debut album, "Hidden From The World", was predominantly recorded in Chicago at the bandâ€™s studio with drums being tracked by Chris King and engineered by Eyal Levi at Audiohammer Studios (Trivium, The Contortionist, Black Dahlia Murder, Daath, & more) in Sanford, FL. It was mixed by Eyal Levi & John Douglass with the help of Jason Suecof at Audiohammer and mastered by Alan Douches of West West Side Music in New Windsor, NY.

"Hidden From The World" displays technical musicianship, catchy songwriting and polished production in an 11 track/hour long package. After the first listen, it is clear that the songs appeal to a vast audience. They have moments of technical prog mastery, moments of pop-rock sing-along catchiness and moments of soft ballad-esque moodiness all atop a foundation of heavy metal.
