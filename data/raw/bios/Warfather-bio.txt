The new full-time projectfronted by ex-Morbid Angel bassist/vocalist Steve Tucker, WARFATHER sees Tucker back to fronting a death metal outfit after over a decade since his departure from Morbid Angel, and over two years since his participation as a vocalist and writer in the well-received Nader Sadek project. On the impending attack, Tucker states, “I am stoked about WARFATHER and our first album! WARFATHER is more than just a metal band; it is a belief system and a meeting of the minds, the ones that can see what is truly happening in the times we are living in. Orchestrating The Apocalypse is a warning to the eyes that choose to be blind, and a call to arms to the minds that do feel the coming changes. It is pure blackened, apocalyptic death metal. Fuck religion, fuck the government! This is their apocalypse. Our time is NOW!”
 
Orchestrating The Apocalypsebrutalizes in a relentless style that builds on the work laid on the three Tucker-fronted Morbid Angel albums -- Formulas Fatal To The Flesh,Gateways To Annihilation andHeretic -- resounding with over forty minutes of pure American death metal. WARFATHER delivers an intense, debilitating performance that should no doubt please fans of Morbid Angel, Nile, and Behemoth, while also sporadically infusing unique even bizarre atmospheric elements, elevating the album to a cutting-edge status. The album was recorded and mixed at Cincinnati-based TME studios by Steve Tucker and mastered by Maor Applebaum at Maor Applebaum Mastering, and is now confirmed for release via Greyhaze Records on January 21, 2014in North America, with a European release date to be announced in the coming weeks. The album's cover artwork was constructed by Ken Coleman. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/WARFATHER">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
