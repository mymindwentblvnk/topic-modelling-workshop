Catherine St Jude Pretorius, otherwise known by her stage name Dope Saint Jude, is a South African rapper who subverts notions of gender identity in Hip Hop. Typically a masculine environment, Dope Saint Jude sees hip hop as a way to reimagine the way she sees the world.
Born in the Cape Flats, an area synonymous with the remnants of Apartheid racial segregation in South Africa, Dope Saint Jude is regarded as a beacon of hope in that she proves that one does not need to conform to get ahead. Instead, she embraces her culture and heritage, using it to inform socially conscious and empowering music.
She released her first EP, titled Reimagine, in 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dope+Saint+Jude">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
