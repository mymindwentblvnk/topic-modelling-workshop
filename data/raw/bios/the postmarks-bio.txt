The group was discovered by Andy Chase of Ivy and subsequently released on his Unfiltered Records label.

Before the release of the album, an EP of remixes was released on iTunes featuring remixes by James Iha, Brookville, Roger O'Donnell, Tahiti 80 and more.

In Spring 2007, the band toured North America with Smoosh and Memphis. A brief summer tour took place to coincide with the band's appearance at the Lollapalooza festival. The group is featured in the "Love" episode of the Nick Jr. show, Yo Gabba Gabba!.

By the Numbers is a series of cover songs released every month of 2008 with each track containing a number in the title.
