There are three artists named Donor.

1. Donor, Miniscule Netlabel co-founder and label manager, was born in New York in 1979.  His career as a DJ started in 1997 when he moved to Spain.  He is currently living and working in his studio in Barcelona, Spain.

2. A dutch progressive thrash metal band which existed from 1986 until 1994.

3.  An emo/punk band from Orlando.

1. Greg Schappert aka Donor was born in New York in 1979. Having lived in cities such as Barcelona, Madrid, Tokyo and Brooklyn, where he currently resides, Greg has acquired quite a few musical influences. However, it was the mid to late 90’s sounds of cities such as Birmingham, Berlin, Detroit and New York that laid the foundation for what originally sparked Greg's interest in electronic music and for what would later influence his production.
After catching up with Tom Russell aka Truss sometime in 2006, the pair secured their first release on Jeremy P. Caulfield’s Dumb-Unit imprint. Donor / Truss have gone on to release further well received records on labels such as the legendary NYC based Synewave as well as top UK label Perc Trax.  They have been remixed by the likes of Norman Nodge, Mike Parker and Samulli Kemppi and have recently remixed Forward Strategy Group.
Donor's recent solo release for Stroboscopic Artefacts is a strong indication of what the future holds for both his production and live acts. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Donor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
