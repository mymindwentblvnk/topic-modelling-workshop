Encoffination is an old school death metal/doom metal band from Georgia and Texas, US that was formed in 2008. The band includes members from bands such as Decrepitaph, Father Befouled, Beyond Hell, Festered, Foreboding, Skincrawler, Vomitchapel and others. 

They released an EP "Temples Descend Below the Earth" in early 2010 via Archasm Releasing. The band released their debut full length "Ritual Ascension Beyond Flesh" in April, 2010 via the now defunct Ritval Death Offerings.

The band kept on releasing EPdespite the set back of a permanent label contract. They released "Seventh Temple of Laodicean Scripture" in October, 2010 via Blood Harvest and later "Amen" via Psychedelic Lotus Order in June 2011 both were not that well recieved by fans and critics alike.

After releasing a split with Grave Upheaval which distributed more of their two recent songs through Psychedelic Lotus Order, the band released their second full length album "O' Hell, Shine in Thy Whited Sepulchres" in late 2011 via Self Made God Records this expanded on their debut sound and recent EPs during 2010 and 2011. They however recieved mixed reviews through blogs and archives sites around the internet.

The band has recently released an EP "Elegant Funerals for the Unknown Dead" with five new songs in anticipation for their third full length via Debemur Morti Productions. They are still finding trouble finding a label to release their music through.
