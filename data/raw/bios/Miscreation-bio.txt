Miscreation was an Australian brutal death metal band formed in 1998, as something of an extension of most of the member's previous band, Objective Zero. Their last known line-up was Pete O'Donohue, Nick Readh, and Nathan Jenkins.

A relentlessly brutal death metal band, an EP was to be released on Venomous in 2000 but Miscreation became linked to a Portuguese label and were looking to record a full length album in the US in early 2002. However at this point several members left the band and by late 2002 only O'Donohue remained. Some months later the line-up reformed and the band featured at Bloodlust in June 2003 as well as some supports with Incantation. Halford left the band in September 2003 and Appleton resigned in mid-2004 after the launch of the album. Bubsie from Ebolie stood in for subsequent live shows with Exhumed but Miscreation is now no more. Oâ€™Donohue has contributed to Adelaide band Tzun Tzu. 

They have one studio album to their name, 'AeOnd', released in 2004 through Dissident. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Miscreation">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
