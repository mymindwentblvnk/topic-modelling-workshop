Formed in early 2009 under the name Poltergeist then changed to Owl and finally to Eulen. Consists of two members: Fadi and Seth. The band mainly played a mixture of Post, Doom and Black metal with some acoustic and symphonic influences until the release of "Morning Blood Requiem", then the band took the Post-influences more seriously, and compositions started flowing in that genre.  The band received great feedback so far from middle-eastern and international countries since the release of "Mother Tree".
