The UK based folk/roots/acoustic band - Bandersnatch have been performing since 2000 although the line-up changed in 2007. Their repertoire ranges from sensitive arrangements of gentle ballads to driving, rhythmical folk rock and blues. Whilst often giving a refreshing edge to established favourites, the band also endeavours to introduce contrasting material from the less frequently explored corners of this particular musical landscape. The warmth and humour that allows them to connect with their audience is not compromised by the discipline that they bring to their performance.
