Box Elders started as the Friday night goof off sessions of brothers Clayton and Jeremiah McIntyre. Naming themselves after the bugs that infested the house they grew up in, they began playing impromptu shows around Omaha. Drummer and organist Dave Goldberg saw them play a free show in a park and was convinced to join. The brothers suggested that Goldberg learn to play both instruments simultaneously instead of adding a fourth member. It took some practice.

In January 2008 they released a 7” on Grotto Records and spent several months of the year touring the USA. The record's off-kilter fuzzy pop caught the attention of Memphis’s Goner Records and earned them an invite to the label's annual festival. Offering to release their next record Box Elders began working on their debut album. “Alice and Friends”--named after the band's favorite cult run vegan Korean BBQ-- will be released by Goner on August 4th, 2009.
