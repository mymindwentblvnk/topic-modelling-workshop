Nation of Language are a Brooklyn new wave trio led by the now husband and wife duo of singer Ian Devaney and self-proclaimed synth princess Aidan Noell, alongside Michael Sue-Poi, who was at one point their drummer and has now stepped into the role of bass player. Devaney though is the main creative force behind Nation of Language. Sonically synth-driven, their music takes elements of krautrock, new wave and post-punk and mixes it with a heavy dose of modern nostalgia.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nation+Of+Language">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
