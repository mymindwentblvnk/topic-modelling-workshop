Molly Nilsson is a Swedish singer and producer, currently based in Berlin, Germany.
Her magical melodies and touchingly clever lyrics grow on you as you find yourself listening to them over and over again. With her one-woman-show, this escaped Swede brings her nostalgic pop, on a journey through life and death, with love and trouble, to a No Mans Land, on the border between reality and dream.
Molly Nilsson has been running her own label and producing her own music since 2007, releasing 5 albums, several EPs and a beautiful string of evocative videos under the Formerly Known as White Bread! moniker.
