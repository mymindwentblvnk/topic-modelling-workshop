After having played together for a year and a half and released a 5-song demo, in a band with the name Allsherjar, Karg (vocals), Joel (drums), Linus (guitar), Joakim (keyboard) and JÃ¶rundr (bass) decided to take on an extra guitar player, consequently, Zharlie joined the band during Fall 2002, however, the music progressed and changed so drastically that a change of name felt necessary, thus the name Shadows of Paragon was embraced.

Five songs were chosen and during Summer 2003 the recording of Shadows' first demo/EP began. The goal was to release the demo/EP at the metal festival Bobfest in March 2004, unfortunately, this process was prolonged due to delayed printing and mastering and the final product was not released until October 2004. During this time Joakim had left the band and since the keyboards played a central role in the lead-melodies, most of the existing songs were tossed. All thoughts about playing live had to be put on hold until new songs had been created. During Fall 2004 and Spring 2005 new songs were created and the band entered the stage again.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shadows+of+Paragon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
