Ride For Revenge is a 3-piece black metal band formed in Lappeenranta, Finland in 2001 but now the band is located at Helsinki. Currently they are Harald Mentor (bass, vocals), J. Pervertor (guitars) and Hail Conjurer (drums). For early live shows, BlackGoat Gravedesecrator (Goatmoon) used to perform vocals. Being so bass oriented and doomy in speed and atmosphere, they have few bands alike in black metal circles. However, they are still sonically associated to black metal and have a tone and pace reminiscent of bands like Barathrum, Beherit or Archgoat.
