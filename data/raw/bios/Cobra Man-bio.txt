Inspired by a request from Los Angeles skateboarding collective the Worble, musician Andy Harry formed electro-punk duo Cobra Man with his friend Sarah Rayne. The group's first task was to write a score for the Worble's video about a human skate ramp. The instrumental "Manramp" introduced Cobra Man's thrashy, disco-punk synth and bass approach, which they employed again on the Worble's next video venture, New Driveway. In early 2017, Memphis label Goner Records, signed the duo and released the New Driveway soundtrack as the band's debut album in August of that year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cobra+Man">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
