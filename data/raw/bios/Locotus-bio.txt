After forming in 1998 in Cairns Australia, Locotus went through many line-up changes through its initial incarnation. The final line-up was established in 2001 with Chris Fowler (vocals, guitars), Barry Koch (guitars), Marianne Rapley (bass), and David Patteson (drums).  Locotus toured extensively in far north Queensland and in the process released 4eps:  The First Assault, Past Demo(n)s, Take Control  and The Final Insult (posthumous release in  2007).  In 2006 after achieving moderate success in the local scene, Locotus decided to part ways and went into hiatus. In 2013 a new incarnation of Locotus emerged that was exclusively a studio project of lead singer and song writer Chris Fowler. He recorded the full length album called Unreleased and Unrepentant which was a collection of the remaining heavily toured songs that had not made it onto a recording before the split in 2006. After the release of this album, Locotus once again went into hiatus. As of 2016, Locotus has re-awoken with Chris Fowler once again at helm and had relocated to Brisbane, Australia.  All new material (the first since 2006) is currently being written and will feature guest artists including Barry Koch from the original line-up.
