The Vhernen project was founded in May 2006.
Vhernen play harsh, depressive, twisted and oppressive Funeral Black exclusively!
At the beginning the activities of the one-man band lead to the realization of the
first CD entitled "S.y.b.e.r.i.a.", released in July 2006 and re-released in November
2006 from Eerie art Records, and re-released yet again in 2009 (this time coupled with the limited MC demo from 2005, Sepulchral Sorrows) as "The Funeral Era" compilation disc. The first full-length, Vhernen's self titled record, was released in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vhernen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
