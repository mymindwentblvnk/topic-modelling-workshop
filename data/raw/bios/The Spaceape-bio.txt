The Spaceape was the moniker of Stephen Samuel Gordon (d. October 2nd 2014). A vocalist, poet, and live performer, The Spaceape’s collaborations with electronic, dub and out of genre music producers told stories from the next dimension. Challenging, provocative and confrontational, The Spaceape together with Kode9 released the seminal album Memories of the Future, followed by the post-nuclear Black Sun in 2011.

Through a unique vocal style, The Spaceape infected the productions of Burial, The Bug, Beat Pharmacy/Brendon Moeller, Martyn, Dub Gabriel, Junior Boys and more. The Spaceape’s studio productions ran parallel to a dynamic live presence, mixing powerful lyricism and furious energy to take the audience beyond their own expectations.

On October 2nd 2014 Stephen Gordon passed away peacefully after a 5 year struggle with a rare form of cancer.
