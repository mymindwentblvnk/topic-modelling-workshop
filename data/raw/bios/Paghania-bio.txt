Hidden in the deepest pagan forest, the roots of the folklore and the power of metal begin to merge to give birth Paghania, a folk metal band from Chile. The mixture of folklore instruments like charango, quena, flute, violin and the heavy sounds of the guitars, bass and drums in addition to the lyrics that tell histories only forest knows of, make a perfect union.
Paghania was formed in the beginning of 2006, after the split up of two metal bands (Septima Tierra and Raven Heart), a heavy metal project was born, but only lasted a month. Soon after, they decided to create a folk metal project: Marcial at guitars, Jaime at voice and keyboard, Daniel at bass, Jordán at violin, Italo at guitars, Matías at drums. With this line up the first Paghania songs were written. Soon after new members joined, Oscar at charango, Fernanda at keyboard and Mario replacing Matías in the drums.
In 2007 Paghania release their first demo titled "Hijos del Folklore" (Sons of the Folklore). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paghania">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
