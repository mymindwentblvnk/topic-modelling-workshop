2. Played music that was a combination of raw death metal and Black Sabbath-influenced doom with touches of old-school Hardcore, in a combination quite unlike anything else I've heard since. Perhaps the closest reference points are the more groove-based moments of Autopsy and Pungent Stench. In contrast to many death metal bands of the time, the lyrical content of their songs was more than just the usual images of death, blood and gore. Themes dealt with included homelessness ("Cardboard City"), politics ("Transparent Lies"), and general greed (erm, "Greed"), although "Mortified Carcass Mess" was a tongue-in-cheek homage to the Gore Metal genre of the likes of Carcass, Autopsy and Impetigo.
