Dopethrone is a sludge / stoner metal band that was established in March 2008 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada as a completely D.I.Y. project in the very core of Hochelaga. After only 3 weeks of legendary drunkenness and sacred bong worship, the members of Dopethrone had already composed 4 songs and were planning out a concept for an album. 

A year later, the new album: "Demonsmoke" was materialized. In the spirit of "Do-It-Yourself", The Logo and concept was created by Vincent (guitar - vocals), the recording by Thomas (drummer) and the CD was produced by Vyk (bassist).

In 2011 Dopethrone released "Dark Foil" and the followed it in 2012 with "III" both were recorded by Thomas (drummer) and produced by Vyk (bassist).

Dopethrone has members of: Vatican, Blight, Unquintessence, (ex)Excreted Cowboy and (ex)Fatal Flaw.
