I'd like to know sum'n about myself myself. Old but young, fat but skinny, rich but poor, wise but stupid, experienced but inexperienced.

This much I do -kinda- know: A DJ for over 20 years, been possessed by various forms of hiphop -culture since 1984.

Since january 2005 I've been hosting the only national hiphop -radioshow running weekly in Finland, Mestarisoundi.

Besides that, I'm writing articles, reviews and stuff for several magazines and websites. I'm also organizing parties and gigs on the regular, deejaying live under the alias djsucks!

A few records along the way, made a fool of myself publicly during the years 1989-1990 w/ a commercial, very cheesy pop-rap -stuff.

Since then I've been on dozens of releases as an MC, maybe best known for being a part of a now-defunct crew Ritarikunta.
