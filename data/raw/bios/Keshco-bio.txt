Eclectic group of home-recorders (based in London, Oxford and Todmorden) who play whatever they feel like: psychedelic folk, tatty synthpop, incidental jingles & odd noises. Unifying lyrical themes include unsparing honest self-deprecation, left-wing social/political outlook, love of the nervous outsider, and surrealistic humour.

Keshco formed in the mid-1990s. Some early recordings are collected on Earlobe Holistics, a disparate 60-minute stream-of-consciousness cassette. Several CD releases followed, notably 2009's Deforestation of Dak, 2013's The Blood, The Horror and 2017's Carvery in the Community. Keshco are stalwarts of the netlabel scene, releasing a string of free EPs under Creative Commons licensing, some aimed specifically at filmmakers.

Keshco also make comedy films and a zine, Beware!. Their line-up as of 2020 is Andy Brain, Bob Follen, Luke Sample and Caroline Vile.  They all write, rewrite and swap roles from one song to the next. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Keshco">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
