Interitus is a band founded in 1993 in Plzeň, The Czech Republic. However, some of the original members left the band after just few years of its existence. By 1996, there were only three members - Vraník (drums), Vítek (violin) and Ioannes (guitar, vocals), who became a frontman. New people joined the band in the following few years and in 1998 the band released its first demo - Interitus´98. Even more line-up changes occurred in the next two years, including s new drummer and the addition of flute and female vocals. The first full-length album Deborah was released in 2000. The success of Deborah inspired the band to work on their new album, which was completed in 2002 and was entitled Srdce krále (Heart of a King). Personal changes, so typical for this band, followed. However, the third studio album “Frozen Darkness” was released in 2005. Within the active years of the band, the line-up would change several times, and finally in 2006 the band gave up using live keyboards and flute and recruited a violinist in addition to the viola-player. As of the end of 2008, the band is rehearsing material for their fourth studio album, due to release in 2009.
The band is endorsed by Jolana guitars.
