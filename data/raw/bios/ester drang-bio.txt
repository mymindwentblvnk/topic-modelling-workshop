Ester Drang is an experimental, post rock musical group from Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. The band was formed in 1995, with guitarist Bryce Chambers recruiting drummer Sterling Williams and bass player Kyle Winner with James McCallister joining in on Rhodes shortly thereafter.

The line-up of the band during its early days also included sitar/guitar player Brian Brewer and songwriter/various keyboards and electronics player David Motter. Williams, Brewer, and Motter departed shortly after the band released its first full-length LP, entitled Goldenwest. Afterwards, Jeff Shoop joined the band, which moved to Jade Tree Records.

Notable outfits the band has toured with include The American Analog Set, Starflyer 59, Styrofoam, and David Bazan of Pedro the Lion.
