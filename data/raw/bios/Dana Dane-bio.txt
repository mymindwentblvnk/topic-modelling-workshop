Dana Dane (born Dana McLeese) is a rap artist known for humorous raps (performed with a fake English accent) and for his fashion sense. He was born in the Walt Whitman housing project in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, in New York City, and began his rap career as part of the Kongol Crew with fellow rapper Slick Rick, whom he sounded markedly similar to (Slick Rick's English lilt was actually genuine however).

His biggest hit in the United States was "Cinderfella Dana Dane," which peaked at #11 on Billboard magazine's R&B charts in 1987 [1]. His debut album peaked at #46 on the Billboard album chart and was certified gold by the RIAA.

Dane operated a clothing boutique in New York for several years in the late 1980s and early 1990s. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dana+Dane">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
