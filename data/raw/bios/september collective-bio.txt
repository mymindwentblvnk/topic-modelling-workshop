September Collective has been formed by Stefan Schneider (To Rococo Rot, Mapstation, Hauntologists,ex-Kreidler), Barbara Morgenstern and Paul Wirkus in 2002.
They met on a tour in Poland, where everyone was with each own's solo project. After the played sets they found it senseless to end up a concert just like this and they started to improvise in the end of the show. Although everyone of them works with loops and computers it worked out, so they continued after this tour and founded September Collective - a project which is based on improvisation and trying out new things. 
So far in 2009, they have released three albums.
