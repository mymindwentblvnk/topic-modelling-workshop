Formed in 2008, DERAILED hail from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The band consists of guitarist DEAN BOLAND[Random Damage], guitarist CARLOS CRUZ[Silent Poetry], vocalist JOHN SINCLAIR, drummer TERRY CORNELSON and bassist GREG KRISTIANSON.
DERAILED’s music style is reminiscent of their pioneer heros… heavy cutting edge guitars, a driving bottom end & intricate, aggressive drum fills. This amalgamation captures the hard rock/metal sound of their peers, but with a modern day approach. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Derailed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
