Abed was formed in early 2001 by guitarists Matan Berkowitz and Guy Bloom and debuted a year later in front of hundreds of metalheads to great acclaim.
The band then started to perform regularly, gaining a cult following for their hyperactive live frenzy, and released three singles: Mechanical Scythe in 2002 (featured on the Holy Shit metal compilation), Operation Silence in 2003 and 281 219 in 2004, after which they took a year long hiatus from the stage.
During that year the band set out to reinvent their sound, rehearsing and writing like never before. With the addition of new vocalist Ran Yerushalmi, Abed was now a six-piece attack of musical, technical and emotional metal. It was time.
As many as 600 metalheads came to Abeds comeback show, held in December 2004, but it wasnt until 2006 that the band finally entered the studio to record their long-awaited E.P: THE COMING OF SOON.
