Perditor was founded in 1997 A.S. by Azazel, Bass and Voice, and S.Sauron, Guitar, with the intention to create a brutal Black Metal band based upon the thoughts of this extreme movement, Satan. 
There were some line-up changes before the first demo, Hell on Earth, was recorded in February 2000 with Vulgair on drums.
After the recordings Nekromancer joined Perditor as second guitarist. Moord replaced Vulgair in September of that year. 
In January 2001, a rehearsal tape ltd. to 33 copies was released with two new songs and two covers, Darkthrone and Mayhem.
Perdition, the second demo, was brought upon mankind in May of 2001.
This demo led to a deal with Ordealis Records from France. 
A MCD called "In Signo Suo" was released in 12/003.


The line-up anno 2003 is:
Azazel: Doom / Vox
Slaughterlord Sauron: Strings of Death
Arvath:Drums
