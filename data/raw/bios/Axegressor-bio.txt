Axegressor was formed in 2006 simply to play thrash metal, a music style all members have been listening to since their early teens (remember the times before internet or even before cell phones?). All band members have gained lots of experience in previous (and current) metal bands for 10-15 years.

Axecution MCD was their first self-financed release, out on September 5th 2007. Sold out in 1000 copies by now. In June 2009 their debut album, entitled Command, was released via Dethrone Music as well as the second album 'Next' in July 2011.

So far Axegressor has supported a variety of foreign bands in Finland such as Zemial (Gre), Adorior (Uk), Dark Tranquillity (Swe), Legion of the Damned (Hol), Toxic Holocaust (Usa), Cannabis Corpse (Usa), Onslaught (UK), Soilwork (Swe) and Municipal Waste (Usa). Axegressor has also been spreading it's musical message outside Finland by visiting Estonia, Russia and was chosen among 140 demo bands to play at Inferno festival in Oslo, Norway in March 2008.
