The duo, comprised of vocalist Grace Hall and Zola Jesus collaborator Nick Turco, came together late last year. Itâ€™s a mixture of R&B and dark dance music, nothing that ever gets too fast or too crazy and definitely stays in that very deep and very intimate moment.

Their debut, The Room, came out November 5th via Time No Place.
