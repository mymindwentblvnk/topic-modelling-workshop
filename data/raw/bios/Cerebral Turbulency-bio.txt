CEREBRAL TURBULENCY is a "hard grind metal core" band from Czech Republic.  They arose in late 1993 as a teenage duo (drums and guitar/vocal) and quickly expanded with a revolving cast of members, with a new line-up every release.  CT has a style that ranges from thrash metal to grind core, employing various vocal styles, and catchy grind riffs.  Their releases include:  four CD albums, two professionally recorded cassettes (debut demo "right to choose" 1995 and 3way split with Gride and M. Tumour 1998), and one split EP with Indonesians TENGKORAK (CT put same stuff as on the 3way split tape...).  Over the last 10 years CT has played both high and low quality gigs through Czech Republic and other countries in Europe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cerebral+Turbulency">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
