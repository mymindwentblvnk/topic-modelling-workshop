1) From the small town of Wesson Ms, to Laurel MS; comes four fellow believers of Christ, who have joined together to form the christian rock band Bloodborne. Guitarist- Anthony Jones, Vocalist- Michael Granger, Bassist- Nathaniel Tucker and drummer Kasey Hicks. All have the same goal, to reach the world for Christ. With many years of experience between them the guys know they have found the band they are meant to be in. From opening the 2007 "Atwood Music Festival" in Monticello, MS. for headliner- Emerson Drive to co-headlining "Lifeline Festival 2007" in Laurel, MS; Bloodborne is playing at churches and festivals all through-out the south Mississippi area. With the guidance of the Lord, Bloodborne is gaining multitudes of fans and reaching the lost for Christ. With their non-traditional style of christian music, these guys set out to tear down the boundaries between secular music and music that touches the soul. Bloodborne's sound is caught somewhere between Audio Adrenaline and Metallica. With hard driving guitars, thunderous bass lines, precision ultra tight drumming, topped off by powerhouse vocals, Bloodborne is out to set the world on Fire for Jesus.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bloodborne">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
