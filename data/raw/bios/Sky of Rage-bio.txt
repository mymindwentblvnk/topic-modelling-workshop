In the autumn of 2009, two friends Tomas Fribergand Joachim Nordlund decided to form a band. They wrote a few more songs in the next couple of months, and started to fill in the position of a vocalist. Nordlund had earlier worked with a singer named Staffan Carlsson, but at that time, Carlsson used to perform rock vocals. When asked if he was interested and would be comfortable singing metal (clean and growls), he agreed to give it a go.

The three continued to write more songs, when Friberg recruited guitar player Jan Cederlund, with whom he had played earlier with other local bands.

The final piece to the puzzle was the bass player Mika Itäranta. He met Nordlund at a bar, and asked the drunk man if he was aware of any bands that needed a bass player and was hired right away.

They played the demo tracks to Metallville, and they liked what they heard. The project took shape in the form of Sky Of Rage's self titled album, released end of July, 2012.
