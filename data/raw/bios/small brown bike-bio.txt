1996 - 2004 / 2009 - Present 

Small Brown Bike is a band from Marshall, Michigan that existed between 1996 and 2004 and reunited in 2009. The trademark of this four-piece is "double vocals" backed by melodies. Their sound is often identified as being similar to other post-hardcore bands such as Avail and Hot Water Music. The band name is derived from their working experience as bike mechanics.

Their last show was in 2004 at the Fireside Bowl in Chicago, after already agreeing to split up. Former members Mike Reed and Dan Jaquint later created the band LaSalle, with Reed's wife playing bass guitar.

Jeff, Mike and Ben started a new band with Nathan Ellis from The Casket Lottery called Able Baker Fox.

In 2009 the band got back together again and played a couple of reunion shows and released a 7inch with new songs. A new full length record "Fell & Found" was released in spring 2011 via No Idea Records.
