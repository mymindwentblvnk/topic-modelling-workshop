Kapakmens is an Latvian metallic hardcore  band formed in 2013 in Rīga, Latvia. Affected by inevitable death, deceived by oppressive artificial positivity, weary of capitalist realities, struggling for conscious responses to the world.

The original lineup:

Ivars Veidelis - vocals;
Māris Muižnieks - guitars;
Aleksandrs Makarovs - bass;
Edgars Felkers - drums.
