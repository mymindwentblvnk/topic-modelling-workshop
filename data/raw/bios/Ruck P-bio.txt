Ruck P started DJing back in 2003. Since then heâ€™s been rocking crowds with his smooth selection of urban music. 

During the past few years, Ruck P has developed his production skills by learning several instruments such as guitar, piano, drums and bass. In 2014, he started to get in touch with international labels. His first Solo-EP was released via Flow-Fi, a label based in Australia. Later, in 2015, he got the chance to contribute a song for the French label On And On Records (C2C, 20syl). Due to these releases, music channels like Majestic Casual, Soulection and EDM.com started to share his music and giving him access to a bigger audience.

Lately, Ruck P has been working and composing for Chillhop Music, contributing to numerous mixes and compilations. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ruck+P">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
