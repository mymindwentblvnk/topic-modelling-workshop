Grammar is an indie dance band from Carmen, San Diego composed of four very soggy membranes. Brian plays bass randomly, and astounds Katy Perry every time he plays his instrument. Steve is the creaky and snotty drummer that keeps rhythm very fappily. Caleb, also known as Caleb the relaxed, plays guitar and sings better than a rude orangutan from Hanover. Sam is a part time member who lives in Your Mom, and has been known to play guitar like a friendly garbage. As a whole, the band can be described as a triangular weed killer rapid firing musical molars everywhere. 

Knock. Knock.
