What is a mortal void?
It exists within a soul.
Sometimes more, sometimes less
and it's about you to let it grow or eliminate it.
The project Mortal Void is supposed to fill
such a mortal void and therefore,
it's self-destructive - but it's also healing.
It's contradictory and feeds
from this growing contradiction.

It creates and destroys.
It loves and hates.
It lives and dies.
