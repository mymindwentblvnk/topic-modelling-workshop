After releasing their debut album 'Pure Filth' through psycheDOOMelic, Wizard's Beard followed this up by hitting the studio again a mere 8 months later and then departing on a UK & European tour.

The restuls of that 2nd trip in to the studio were released as 'Four Tired Undertakers' on Feb 10th 2012 through Altsphere productions, a european tour will follow in the summer.

Four Tired Undertakers Press:
"'Four Tired Undertakers' is a nasty, toxic dose of afflicting, agonizing, cruel, excruciating doomed sludge that should have ALL fans of the riff drooling with delight." - Doommantia 9.5/10

"The band have honed their sound and have become more ambitious with the structures of their songs – they’re more complex but no less immediate, hitting hard from start to finish. The band haven’t changed, they’ve just gotten better at what they do." - The Sleeping Shaman

Pure Filth Press:
"With crushing, primordial riffs providing the backdrop for Chris Hardy’s ferocious-sounding screams, Wizard’s Beard’s debut is not for the faint-hearted." Chybucca Sounds

"One of the best debut releases in recent years" - Doommantia 9.5 / 10

"Considering the choice of album title it also doubles as an accurate description of the music contained within as the tempo lurches back and forth like a punch drunk psychopath, spitting and snarling the dark parts of their inner psyche" - The Sleeping Shaman
