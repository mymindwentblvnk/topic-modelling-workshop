In the summer of 2014 two guys were watching the FIFA World Cup final drunk. During the match they came up with the idea to put together a band. Two hours later there were five members in the band, and the first demo was ready. That is how The Holy came to be.The band was founded on desire to make humongous, noisy songs and to create magnificently large soundscapes with the help of two drummers and a whole lot of roaring guitars.

They are a Finnish alternative rock band formed in Helsinki in 2014. The quintet has been shaking the ground of the Nordic music scene since the release of their debut EP More Escher And Random Notes in 2016. Mixes of post-punk, Bruce Springsteen and Peter Gabriel with Krautrock influences are often mentioned when speaking about The Holy’s well-crafted sound and songwriting.

Hailing from one of the darkest countries in the world, The Holy are known for their Nordic melancholy, highly explosive live shows and for the unusual band formation that includes two drummers who keep the pulse high at all times. Lead singer Eetu Henrik Iivari’s tense and timeless voice and the guitar loaded wall of sound often makes you feel comfortably uncomfortable. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Holy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
