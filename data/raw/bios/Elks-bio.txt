Three different bands...

1)
http://www.myspace.com/elkstheband (London, UK)

2)
http://www.myspace.com/elkselkselks (Brooklyn, NY)

Somewhere at the crossroads of punk, metal, sludge, garage, and a beer-soaked bag of 12-sided die lie Brooklyn chug-monsters ELKS. Much like contemporaries High On Fire or Coliseum, the band is at once majestic and rollicking, matching fantastic, orc-stabbing melodies with a friendly, mastodonic gallop

3)
Kinsella-esque emo from 2006 (Melbourne, AUSTRALIA)
