Gabi Wilson (born June 27, 1997), better known by her stage name H.E.R. (acronym for Having Everything Revealed), is an American singer from Vallejo, California. Before being known as H.E.R., Wilson rose to fame by participating in 2009’s Radio Disney’s Next Big Thing. She signed to RCA Records and has released five extended plays under the label: H.E.R. Volume 1 (2016), H.E.R. Volume 2 (2017), H.E.R. Volume 2, The B Sides (2017), I Used To Know Her: The Prelude (2018) and I Used To Know Her: Part 2 (2018). These EPs were also compiled into two separate full-length projects: the eponymous compilation was released in 2017, compiling the two volumes and the b-sides EP, while 2019's I Used to Know Her compiled both of the IUTKH EPs with five additional new songs, as well as extended versions of "Be on My Way", "Going" and "Lord is Coming". Wilson's identity was previously unknown as the mystery was a metaphor for herself and she preferred to be represented by music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/H.E.R.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
