Incorporating influences as diverse as Progressive to RandB, Speaking To Stones musical style encompasses many different styles and genres. Bands such as Rush, Dream Theater and King’s X may be obvious at first listen but numerous plays of the CD also reveals touches of Marillion, Soundgarden and Peter Gabriel just to name a few. Though the CD has its fair share of chops-laden technicality, there is also strong attention given to making progressive music that grooves and has strong melodic sensibilities. One does not need to be a fan of only progressive music per se to enjoy the broad musical styles that ruminate throughout the CD.

Speaking To Stones the album was written between the Fall of 2004 and the Summer of 2006, the songs that comprise the CD were written and recorded sporadically. “Down,” Shallow,” and “Waiting For . . .” were written and recorded within a couple of months. The rest of the songs were written and demoed in the Spring of 2004. It took almost two years of faith and diligent effort to finally record the rest of the material and re-record parts of those original tracks to create the completed CD.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Speaking+to+Stones">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
