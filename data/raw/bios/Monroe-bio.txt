5) A defunct punk-rock cult-band from Vlissingen, Zeeland, Netherlands, fronted by singer Jaap van Boven. They only released one single (Polio For The People / Disco Fever) in 1978. The single was very controversial. Around that time there was an outbreak of polio in the orthodox-protestant community in the province of Zeeland, because they refused vaccinations because of their belief. The picture sleeve showed the band around an open grave, with Jaap taking a crap on the coffin. "Is God your Shepherd, who commands..... The Wheelchair dealer rubs his hands" is a classic line from the song's lyrics. Jaap van Boven would later re-emerge in several other bands (such as Het Elektrisch Combo) and is still active in the local music scene.
