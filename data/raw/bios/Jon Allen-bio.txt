Jon Allen (born Jonathon Allen, 12 May 1977) is a folk-rock singer-songwriter born in Winchester, UK, and now based in London. His debut album Dead Man's Suit was released in 2009 on Monologue Records. He is best known for the hit songs "In Your Light" and "Going Home", the latter of which featured in a worldwide advert for Land Rover. In 2011, Allen released his second album 'Sweet Defeat'.

While at school, Allen featured in a number of school bands, playing drums. On one occasion Jon became the lead singer and realized that he was a natural show off. He later attended the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts (LIPA) on a songwriting course. Through this he learnt how to become a more self-disciplined writer. After graduating Jon moved to London, after one of his demos received a five-star review in the magazine Making Music. Management offers in London soon followed, prompting Jon to immerse himself in the live music scene and surround himself with like-minded people. Since moving to London, Allen found himself sharing the stage with artists as Emmylou Harris, Mark Knopfler, KT Tunstall and Jose Gonzalez.

After selling more than 20,000 downloads via his website of Going Home Jon is steadily building up a strong and supportive fan base in the UK. In 2009 he released his debut album Dead Mans Suit which featured the singles 'In Your Light', 'Dead Mans Suit', 'When The Morning Comes' and 'Down By The River'.

On May 22nd 2011, Allen released his second album 'Sweet Defeat' through Monologue Records. His first single from the album, 'Joanna' was playlisted on Radio 2.

'Sweet Defeat' was released in the US via OK! Good Records and can be purchased or streamed here:
