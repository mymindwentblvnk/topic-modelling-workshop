The other...

BIG WORDS formed out of bordem in a place which resembles Dresden. They make music that "sometimes makes sense, but most of the time just sounds like noise". With influences coming from Sonic youth, Nirvana, Mudhoney and watching too much TV, their songs are reminiscent of the early nineties Grunge scene at its best with an up to date twist and lyrics that derive from "heartbreak and picking flowers".
"we learnt our instruments by listening to other bands who can't play properly"
