England based DJ and Producer Mike Foyle made his name in January 2005 with his debut release, "Space Guitar" on Electronic Elements, a sub-label of Armada Recordings, Holland. 
This was followed up later in the year by the "For Your Eyes Only EP". But it wasn't until the release of a collaboration project between Mike and the "Signalrunners" entitled "Love Theme Dusk" that Mike Foyle became a well known and respected trance producer amoungst clubbers and DJs around the globe. 
"Love Theme Dusk" is a piano-trance production hailed as one of the biggest trance anthems of 2005 by music magazines and the worlds top DJs. 
The track was released on "Armind", another imprint on "Armada Recordings" along with a "Mike's Broken Record Remix", an "Airbase Remix" and a "Signalrunners Surise Remix". 
"Love Theme Dusk" was followed up in 2006 by a solo piano-trance anthem called "Shipwrecked", with remixes from "John O'Callaghan vs Mike Foyle", "Sean Tyas" and "Gareth Emery". 
The piano-trance direction was proving a successful one for Mike and so has led to other releases of a similar style since.
 "Firefly" is the third and latest track that Mike has signed to Armind to follow the piano-trance series. 
Currently unreleased, it is already getting Radio 1 support from "Judge Jules" in the UK. 
The track is due to be released in the coming months of 2007. Mike's success as a music producer has helped to fuel his DJ career as well. 
Mike has got gig dates all over Europe, Asia and the UK and is planning a Summer 2007 tour of Canada and the United States.
