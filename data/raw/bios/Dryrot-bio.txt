... the bavarian groove machinery!!!

If comparable to other bands, DRYROT sounds similar to Machine Head, Sevendust, Prong, Hatebreed. That they deserve just as much attention is due to the high standard of their material and their professional way of working in the studio and live performances. Their music is a synthesis of different elements with heaviness as common basis. DRYROTâ€™s strength is definitely their energy! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/dryrot">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
