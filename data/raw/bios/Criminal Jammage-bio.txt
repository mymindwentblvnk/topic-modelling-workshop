Criminal Jammage first sprang to life in mid-2006 under the name 'SkadK' when Kris and Ed decided they needed a band to vent their musical aggression. The band went through a series of name and line-up changes until current drummer Ste was recruited into the band and the name 'Criminal Jammage' was decided upon. Months passed and the band found themselves in need of a vocalist and bass player. Already a friend of the band, Lorcan (Ex-Nuclear Reign) was chosen to fill the position of bass player, who with him brought vocalist Dave into the equation, resulting in the bands most powerful line-up to date. Currently active on the gigging circuit the band have just finished recording there debut E.P.
