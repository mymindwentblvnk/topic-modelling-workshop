Garcia & Garcia was a short-lived band formed in the State of SÃ£o Paulo by the musicians Mario Garcia, Waly Garcia and Ricardo Confessori (later of  Angra  and Shaman fame). They played a kind of Deep-purple-esque speed melodic heavy metal, very different from the power metal bands at the time, in a background that would soon be took over by grunge, and put all the heavy metal world in hiatus during the 1990's.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Garcia+&+Garcia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
