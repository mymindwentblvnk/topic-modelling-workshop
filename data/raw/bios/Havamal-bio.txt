Havamal is a Folkish Black Metal band from the cold depths of Finland. Havamal hasn't released any albums yet, only demo recordings that can be found on the web for free.
Havamal was formed in 2004 by Runedancer and Lupus Noctem. Inspired by early Black Metal and Folklores (Both "Eddas" and "Kalevala") Havamal continues the battle that once took place and charges ahead with their newly sharped swords.
Odalism, Realism and Nihilism are the band members philosophy and that can be seen and heard in their music. 

There also used to be a "swedish" (?) viking metal band with the same name. Do not confuse them with one another. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Havamal">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
