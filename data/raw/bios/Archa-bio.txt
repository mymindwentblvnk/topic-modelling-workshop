3. Archa is none other than Wolfen technologies’ little brother, eighteen year-old Arthur Chant from the U.K., already unveiling some impressive talent in the sound department. Being around to watch him develop and bloom has been and is truly going to be an exciting experience. Alleviation, Archa’s debut release, has a smooth sheen of deep, rippling tones and feelings. The emotions glide upon the steady rhythms of the stepping motions. His style in bass music is diverse, a new take on that of the norm. Triple Drop Productions are honored to welcome this delightful young friend on this voyage in search of moods and deep thought, around and amongst the auditory spectrum.
