The band formed by Marcelo Oliveira in Brazil, began their careers in 2007 -- almost immediately hitting the studios to record their first album. They were quickly catapulted into the spotlight when they were invited to open for Within Temptation and  later again for symphonic metal icon, Tarja Turunen in Brazil.

Hydria is comprised of Marcelo Oliveira heading up guitars/grunts, Turu Henrick on bass, Márcio Klimberg on the keys, and Fabiano Martins on drums, with enchanting lead vocals by the beautiful Raquel Schuler, who also on occasion plays the acoustic guitar.

It has been a long road for the band since 2007. Among many line-up changes, Hydria persevered towards their goal of making music. Hydria’s self-produced, self-funded debut album, Mirror of Tears, released in 2008 amidst the time most bands are still learning to play well with each other.

Their latest album mixes the melodic vocals of Schuler with occasional, yet highly skilled grunts by Oliveira. Poison Paradise takes the listener on a journey of highs and lows, varying speeds and emotions, ranging from symphonic operatic vocals and heavy guitar riffs, to sweeter, more mellow rock influenced sounds. While the topics covered can be quite dark, make no mistake in thinking Hydria is Gothic or simply rock.

The band firmly claims their metal roots and Poison Paradise can be described in one word: intense. Fans of their first album will be immensely happy with Poison Paradise. Regardless of their label-less standings, new listeners will find the maturity and fullness of sound to be equal if not greater than what is expected of a band assigned to a major label. Hydria is sure to set a new standard for their own creative abilities and garner even more attention than they have over the past 3 years.
