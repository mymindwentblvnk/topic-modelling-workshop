VORUM is a death metal band hailing from Mariehamn, Åland Islands and came to existence in the winter of 2006. The three members J.Johansson, M. Jalava and M. Josefsson started rehearsing almost daily and began focusing on writing songs. After a while the band (then under the moniker of Haudankaivaja) did a demo in the summer of 2007 wich contained 7 songs and was recorded by M. Josefssons brother Jesper. This demo was never officially released. The band played a few gigs in Mariehamn and in late February of 2008, Vorum went to Panu Posti to record a new demo that later came to gather some attention. The demo of 2008 was well received in reviews on internet fanzines like imperiumi. net but as well in magazines such as Miasma, and a few cd-r demos was sent out to people who asked for it. Vorum has had some radio plays in the YleX Metalliliitto show and was seen on the front cover of the finnish metal/rock magazine “Inferno” this year. The latest demo in question is now going to be released as an MCD by Woodcut Records named “Grim Death Awaits” and it is the bands first official release. Vorum is now slowly but steady writing new material for their debut full-length album.

Death Metal!
