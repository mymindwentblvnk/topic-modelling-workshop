RandomWalk was formed in the winter of 2005 in Athens.

Combining the aggresion of death metal with the lyricism of atmospheric gothic, RandomWalk joined the roster of I for an I Records & Media and released their first album "Redemption" in 2008, gaining spectacular reviews for their music as well as the theatricality of their stage performing.

In 2010 they return with their second full-length album "Absolution", having an even more impressing acceptance both inside and outside of Greece.

At the time being, RandomWalk's third album "Declaration" is ready and more mature than ever. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/RandomWalk">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
