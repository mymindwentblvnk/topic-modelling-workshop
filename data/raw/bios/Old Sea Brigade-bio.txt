The nom de plume of Atlanta, Georgia-raised, Nashville-based singer/songwriter Ben Cramer, Old Sea Brigade emerged in 2016 with a critically lauded EP that featured a compelling, heartfelt, and atmospheric blend of folk, country, Americana, and indie rock that invoked names like Bon Iver, Iron and Wine, and the National. A string of singles and an EP for the Nettwerk label paved the way for his 2019 full-length debut, Ode to a Friend.

After several years playing in bands around the Atlanta area, Cramer decided to forge ahead as a solo act, adopting the Old Sea Brigade name in 2015. Self-released in 2016, his eponymous debut EP earned him enough buzz to land key support slots for Hiss Golden Messenger, Julien Baker, and Benjamin Francis Leftwich during his first U.S. tour. Later that year, he inked a deal with Nettwerk and began work on a follow-up release. Cramer's first single for Nettwerk, the rousing "All the Same," dropped in September 2016 and was later included on 2017's Wash Me Away, the first of three EPs he would issue that year. The song "Tidal Wave," from his next EP, Cover My Own, notched significant play on streaming networks. Cramer closed out a banner year with the Christmas EP Songs for the Holidays. Scattered throughout 2018 were the singles "Hope," "Feel You," and "Sinkhole," which preceded Old Sea Brigade's 2019 full-length debut, Ode to a Friend. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Old+Sea+Brigade">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
