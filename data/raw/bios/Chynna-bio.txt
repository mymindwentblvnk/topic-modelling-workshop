Chynna was a model and rapper who blended the two worlds with ease. Formerly signed to Ford Models, she starred in DKNY’s spring 2015 advertising campaign and walked in the brand’s runway show. She also released several wittily incisive hip-hop singles online, including the viral hits “Glen Coco” and “The Conversation”.  She performed regularly with A$AP Rocky’s hip-hop collective A$AP Mob, and collaborated with Scottish mega-producer and Kanye West collaborator Hudson Mohawke on the 2014 song "MadeInChynna". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chynna">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
