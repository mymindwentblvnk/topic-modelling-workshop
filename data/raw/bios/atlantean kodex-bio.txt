Almost nothing certain is known about this enigmatic outfit from the northern forests of the kingdom of Vilseck, Bavaria, Germany. Formed around 2006 by Trummer and Kreuzer, the band quickly managed to become the centre of the new European epic metal movement. Their "The Pnakotic Demos", released in 2007, was praised by journalists and fans all over the world as one of the best Epic Metal albums ever.
Rooted deeply in the sound of Bathory, old Manowar, Solstice and Manilla Road, Atlantean Kodex deliver an heavy mixture of dramatic hymns, harmonic twin guitars and melodies, telling tales of lost worlds and ages past. With one foot  the past and the other in the present, Atlantean Kodex bridge the gap between the elder world and now, between dream and reality. What the future holds, even the wisest cannot say...
