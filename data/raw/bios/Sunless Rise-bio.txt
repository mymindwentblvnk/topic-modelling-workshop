Sunless Rise is melodic/symphonic death metal band formed in St. Petersburg, Russia in August 2009. They released their “Promo EP” later that same year, and the video for the first song from this release, “Nothing To Save”, was released in January 2010.

The band mix clean and harsh vocals with their highly proficient musicianship to create a sound reminiscent of the Finnish melodic death metal scene of about 10 years ago. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sunless+Rise">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
