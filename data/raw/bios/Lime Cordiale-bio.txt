Oliver and Louis Leimbach started playing music together as brothers later in life, when they could stay put in the same room without giving each other dead-arms. Thanks to a nagging mother, they didnâ€™t give up their classical instruments and brought them into the band. Brendan Champion on trombone and James Django Jennings on drums make up the rest of Lime Cordiale. With influences ranging from French pop to parental arguments, from Indian Raga music to midnight snacks, Lime Cordiale is the new Quirk Pop. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lime+Cordiale">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
