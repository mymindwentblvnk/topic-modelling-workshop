Ossuary Anex is a brutal death Metal act originating from Ufa, Bashkortostan. The band was formed in 2008 by Max (Guitar). The line-up was completed in the following couple of years with the coming of drummer Sergey, vocalist Chris and bass-player Semen. As a result, the debut CD "Awakening" was released in 2012 on SoulFlesh Collector Records, demonstrating a primitive brutal death with slamming elements. Following the first release, Ossuary Anex performed several times in gigs and metal-fests. Ossuary Anex is currently working on a second album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ossuary+Anex">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
