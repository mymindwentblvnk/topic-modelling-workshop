“… Kaamora knows how to kick your teeth in, Australian style…These guys are the real deal, and have their eyes set on world domination…”

Twisted Hillbilly Magazine (USA), Issue 9
August 2008

Luke Greenwood, Will X, Aaron Thomas, Dylan Jones and Jase Emgee, 5 members of the Ballarat (Victoria, Australia) music community that aimed to deliver some loud heavy metal, formed Kaamora in late 2007/early 2008.

Influenced by a range of Metal and Progressive Rock artists they fuse Spanish, Eastern and Classical melodies with a heavy, fast paced rhythm to create music that will blast your ear-holes out, mash your insides to a pulp and screw with your self control, leaving you head-banging until your brains fall out.

Lambs to the Slaughter, Kaamora’s debut EP, highlights lyrics that paint a range of twisted sonic images, from bloody medieval battles to disturbing prophecies of a future lead by a machine, and everything in between.

Lambs to the Slaughter took its price in sweat, creative juices, sore heads, numb eardrums, time and money. The EP is a product from start to finish, with the recording done by Matt Collins from Studio Groove, of the creative minds of Kaamora. 

Kaamora’s reputation for delivering a relentless barrage of sound live is growing fast. A Kaamora gig is guaranteed to leave your neck sore, your legs cramped and your hair drenched in sweat and spilt beer.
