Mansour (Persian: منصور ‎, born 28 July 1971) is a contemporary artist born in Tehran, Iran. Persian musical artist. From a new generation of rising singers of the exiled Iranian community based in Southern California, he is now ranked as one of the top male singers of the Iranian music scene. Beside Iran, he also has a fan base in [Afghanistan], Tajikistan and to a limited extent Iraq, Uzbekistan and Russia.
Despite the Iranian government’s restrictions on pop music, he has nevertheless been able to eclipse other singers in gaining a wide recognition in the country.Equally popular among both men and women, his songs now serve various ceremonial openings of events, such as soccer games, weddings and private parties. Due to the lively nature of his music that has engaged and absorbed the youth of Iran, he is now permanently banned from returning or performing for any reason in that country.
