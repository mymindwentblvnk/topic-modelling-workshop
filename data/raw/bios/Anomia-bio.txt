Four piece Finnish metal band Anomia was born in 2005. The band plays agressive, groovy metal with Finnish lyrics and is known of combining bad-ass performance with shitty jokes.

Anomia was formed by Juho Lehtinen (drums) and Henri Helle (bass). The idea was to go and play metal while having a shitload of fun. Helle's cousin Henri Niiranen (guitar/vocals) was taken along the ride. In 2007 Antti Savolainen (guitar) replaced the old guitarist who left the band for personal reasons. Nowadays Anomia goes to gigs as much as possible.

Anomia has made three studio demos. The latest two were recorded, mixed and mastered in Music Bros studios.
