Brain Implosion was a thrash metal band from Holland formed in 1987. They released a demo in 1988 called "Liquidation" and an EP in 1990 called "Sandgrains". After the band split-up,  the 2nd guitarist that played with Brain Implosion briefly had asked the drummer  to play with  Abacinate,  (not to be confused with the deathcore band) who released two demos in 1990 and 1991. The members of Abacinate then went on to form Out of the System who released a demo/rehearsal tape in 1993 and contributed a track to the DSFA Records sampler (recorded in December 1993). All bands lining up ex Brain Implosion members ended in 1995. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brain+Implosion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
