The American band Black Dethe was formed in San Francisco, California, in 1985 by some guys in their mid teens as a very primitive Possessed / Slayer influenced death / thrash metal band. The band name is pronounced "Black Death" but they used the alternate spelling not be confused with the Ohio based heavy metal band, inspired by Megadeth. On September 7th, 1985, they did their first gig opening up for Possessed and Death Angel at Ruthies Inn. With their original line-up they also played shows with Death and Desecration at Ruthies and with Mordred and Ulysses Siren at The Rock on Broadway, as well as some smaller shows here and there.

Before having played their first show they recorded a five track demo tape called "Evil Prayer" during the summer of 1985 which included the songs "Evil Prayer", "Warfare", "Damnation End", "Dying World" and "Lethal Touch". In late 1986 the original line-up fell apart and Henry and Terrence gathered new members for the band. In 1988 they recorded their only studio demo, "Mary's Blood", which was heavily influenced by Slayer's classic album "Reign In Blood". The tape contained the songs "Mary's Blood", "Intoxicated", "Sheen Of Annihilation", "Distributing Pain" and "Evil Prayer" in a new version. The band broke up soon after this recording, having played their final gig opening for Skitzo in Redwood City.

The black and white photo below was a test promo picture they took before bassist / vocalist Chris Turner joined the band. The blond guy was a friend of the band called Jason who filled in for the photo shoot. The photo was taken by Sabine Stangenberg in front of some old church that no longer exists. Chris was an active member of the Church of Satan and used to write articles for their magazine Black Flame. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Dethe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
