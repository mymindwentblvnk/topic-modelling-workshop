L.A. Salami (born Lookman Adekunle Salami in London, England) is a British musician.

An articulate, melodic, poetic singer songwriter of quality and distinction, he has been described as ‘a product of your imagination- old and new, young and aged, philosopher of saints and imposter doyen – twin sister to Dionysus and Apollo’s hungry son’. This London-born artist makes music ‘despite your qualms’ and ‘starves in the spare hour’. He remains unpretentious despite what this may imply and his sweet voice ‘is like the application of aloe vera on a sunburned back'.
