Damien Storm is a solo project that combines horror concepts with heavy metal music. Damien uses a blend of creative ideas to achieve this sound. All of his songs are centered around horror themes. It's sort of like listening to a horror movie. Along with the music he combines certain effects like howling wind, creepy sounds, weird voices and ghosts speaking.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Storm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
