Lady Lamb the Beekeeper (now known only as Lady Lamb) is the musical moniker of Aly Spaltro. Spaltro began her music career writing and recording songs in a DVD rental store in Brunswick, Maine, using the store as her studio after finishing her midnight shift at the cash register. She anonymously gave out free samples of her first demo CD under the name Lady Lamb The Beekeeper, and quickly gained local popularity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Lamb+the+Beekeeper">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
