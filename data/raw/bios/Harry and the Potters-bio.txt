Harry and the Potters are an indie rock band that was formed in Norwood, Massachusetts in 2002 by brothers Joe DeGeorge and Paul DeGeorge. The band was inspired by the J.K. Rowling book series 'Harry Potter' and were the first of many similar artists making music about the fictional boy wizard. Producing what's known as wizard rock, they've released four full-length studio albums: Harry and the Potters (2003), Voldemort Can't Stop the Rock! (2004), Harry And The Potters And The Power Of Love (2006) and Lumos (2019) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Harry+and+the+Potters">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
