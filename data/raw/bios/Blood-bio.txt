If you are looking for the Japanese band, please change your tags to ＢＬＯＯＤ.
At the moment there seems to be the problem that Last.fm can not redirect the already existing thousands of scrobbles meant for ＢＬＯＯＤ to a correct artist, as it seems not to make a difference between Blood and BLOOD (spelled in capitals), and also auto corrects many correctly tagged tracks to this artist. As long as this problem persists, confusion is unavoidable.
