In June 1997, LENGTH OF TIME (L.O.T) started with members coming from different acts out of the Bxl(Brussels) scene. The band was supposed to be a side-project. However, after a first, but impressive demo and a lot of shows in various locations. It didn't take them long to realise this was what they had to continue and soon their well-known classic album 'Approach To The New World' was recorded. This was the start of their busy tour and show schedule. L.O.T embraces a very dark and pessimistic vision on humanity and is in total war with the morose atmosphere of our world. All members growing up with the metal and hardcore from the 80's, L.O.T offers a wide variety in the musical part and every new release sounds different. In 1999 their album 'Shame To This Weakness Modern World' was released and it is their most aggressive and hardest album. The band has just released their 3th opus entitled 'How Good The World Could Be.. Again'. This is a strong and very mature release, and might be the new face of the band for the future. Their latest album called 'Antiworld' released in 2003. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Length+Of+Time">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
