Eclips is a band from the Netherlands. The band members started playing together at the end of 2007. The first song is already underconstruction. Our first song is now released (19 may 2008) on last.fm. We have released 2 versions of the song, one with vocals and the other without. We recommend the second one:P, we can't realy sing. So if you can, send a message and maybe you could join us..
