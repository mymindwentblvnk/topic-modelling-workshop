Demdike Stare is the occult project of Miles Whittaker and Sean Canty. Miles is also known as Modern Love's DJ MLZ or as one half of Pendle Coven. Sean Canty is the dedicated digger behind the Haxan events and a member of the respected Finders Keepers crew of vinyl vultures. 

The duo's collaborative project tracks the sonic ley lines of cult soundtracks, Arabesque dubs and psychotomimetic ephemera with a proper Lancastrian twist.

Their releases, notable for their beautiful cover design by Andy Votel, have included Symbiosis, Liberation Through Hearing, Voices of Dust and Forest of Evil. In 2011 the latter three were compiled as Tryptych.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demdike+Stare">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
