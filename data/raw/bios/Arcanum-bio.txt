Apparently, there are five Arcanums!  One is a down-tempo trip-hop duo, the second is a melodic-deathmetal-core band, the third refers to the soundtrack of the PC Game "Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura", which has been composed by Ben Houge and fourth is electronic band playing in style od berlin school.
--------------------------------------------------
1.  Arcanum, the alternative "acoustic trip-hop" duo, began in the mid 90's as an electronic band from the US. Shaz Hobrath and Brett Schieber self-released their first cd, "The Spoken Scream", to critical acclaim. A European version of the cd (with the additional track "Phantasm" and new artwork) was later released by Westcom. This led to reaching #7 on the charts in Lithuania with their introspective song about coming to terms with one's visage entitled "The Puzzle of Reflection". Later cds, "Dragging Canvases and Breathing Lies (demos)" and the striking "No Mercy for Virgin Soil" displayed a further nack for emotional and dramatic trip-hop, separating them from their peers. Afer "No Mercy...", Shaz has authored many short stories under the name "Jarod Ameil" and "Tree Hobrath". Brett has gone on to a successful solo independent career (http://brettmusic.net). He's also written for and produced for a wide array of artists in many genres and released a largely instrumental cd under the name "Prankster" (http://myspace.com/prankster). 
Arcanum has recently reconvened to record "The Smell of Gasoline" for a currently untitled horror film. This song can be heard exclusively on LastFM. Plans for a future Arcanum release are imminent.  (http://myspace.com/arcanummusic)

2.  In the summer of 2004 four guys (Gabriel Lafranco, Peter Kernstock, Peter Langenecker and Peer Ebner) founded the melodic-deathmetal-core band "Arcanum". One year before they had already played together in the hardcoreband "Injection". A second guitar-player was missing, therefore they decided to search for one…
In a strange pub Peter K.met a totally drunken guy named Manuel Höller with whom they were hanging out together at the rehearsal a week later and got mad by their music like freaks.
Unfortunately Peer had to leave Arcanum few weeks later... 
2005 Fortunately Arcanum found a new bassplayer named Rudolf Galler soon. Afterwards they moved into a new rehearsal-room at the black lagoon studios but six months later Rudolf had to leave us. So they found the female bassplayer called Bernadette S. who was playing in the melodicmetal-band "Diabolica". Then they had a complete line-up.

2007 Release of their first LP-Album "What if you die tomorrow..."
