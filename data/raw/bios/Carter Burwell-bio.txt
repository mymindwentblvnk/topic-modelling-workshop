Carter Burwell (born November 18, 1955, in New York City, New York) is a Academy Award nominated composer of film soundtracks.

As a film composer, Burwell has had a long working relationship with film makers the Coen brothers, scoring every film they have made. He enjoys working with leftfield directors and has also scored all of Spike Jonze's films. Among his best known non-Coen Brothers film scores are And the Band Played On (1993), Conspiracy Theory (1997) and The Spanish Prisoner (1997), Hamlet (2000), Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead (2007),  In Bruges (2008) and Twilight (The Score) (2008), The Blind Side (2009), Carol (2015), Wonderstruck (2017) and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017). Carol And Three Billboards were nominated for Best Original Score in 2015 and 2017.

In April 2005, Burwell composed and conducted music, performed by The Parabola Ensemble, for the plays « Sawbones » written and directed by the Coen Brothers, « Hope Leaves the Theater » written and directed by Charlie Kaufman and « Anomalisa » written and directed by Francis Fregoli. This was a segment of the sound-only production Theater of the New Ear, which debuted at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn, NY with support from Sirius Satellite Radio, United Talent Agency and Sony Pictures.

He recently created a track called « Bella’s Lullaby » for the film Twilight (2008). The soundtrack released on November 4, 2008.

Burwell married Christine Sciulli in 1999.
