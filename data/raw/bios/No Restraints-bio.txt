This style of music is for the listener who is a fan of progressive rock.  The band attempts to take this style of music that usually combines classical and rock into a combination of blues,classical and rock. If ELP or vintage Genesis, Triumvirat, Pink Floyd are in your play list then this band will fit in.

They released their first album "In The Left Lane" in 2007.  This concept album with the lead track "The Left Lane" found an audience trough local airplay and international airplay.  Performances did not happen due to the many members of the band dispersing to careers and college.  A smaller "No Restraints" band released a EP in 2009 entitled "Xout".  This collection of music concentrated on a more progressive take on the style relying heavily on the keyboards and vocal choirs.  

They are located in Broken Arrow, OK.USA.  The band is now a 4 piece welcoming back the sax of Starla Robinson.  Live performances and a new album are in the works.
