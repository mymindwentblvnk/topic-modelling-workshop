Farben is a microhouse project of Jan Jelinek with influence from soul and funk. As Farben he focuses more on the dance aspect and is more minimalistic compared to music released under his real name. He is best categorized by heavily use of clicks and cuts, complicated rhythms, loops and elements of microsound. "Farben" is the German word for “colors”. The first Farben releases (KLANG 19, 25, 32, 39, 48 and 65) all have different cover colors: black, white, cyan, magenta and yellow. These are the colors you use for printing (CMYK). Most colors can be made by mixing these. The covers also featured photos from the court process against the so called Baader-Meinhof Gang, a part of the militant left anti-imperialist movement Red Army Fraction (RAF). 

Farben also performs under other pseudonyms like The Exposures, Gramm, Jan Jelinek and N. Gratin. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Farben">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
