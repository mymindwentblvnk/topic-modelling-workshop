Biography

5 people making some noise and most importantly enjoying it,coming to life in 2011 who play no nonsense, no ego , no bullshit back to the raw bone rock and metal. That is both heavy and loud enough to shake beer bottles off the table. We are not a put together money making cash cow or a ego boosting personal profile raiser, just regular guys chunking out riffs doing there own music and enjoying it. Our aim is to be delivering honest rock/metal that we write ourself and enjoy playing.
