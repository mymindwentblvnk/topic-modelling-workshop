Clown Alley was a 1980s San Francisco Bay area punk rock band that featured Mark Deutrom on guitar and Lori Black on bass, both of which would go on to play bass in the Melvins in the future. The Melvins themselves at one point did a Clown Alley cover called Theme, which has appeared on a limited run single and as part of the Singles 1-12 collection.

Clown Alley only put out one album, Circus of Chaos which was originally released on Deutrom's Alchemy Records, which would also release albums by the Melvins and Neurosis. It was later reissued on Southern Lord Records, appearing on cd for the first time.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Clown+Alley">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
