Two groups have used this name:

1) A dance punk band from Seattle, WA consisting of Astra Elane and Dustin Patterson.

2) A two-piece band including Samuel Conaty and Tadhg Kelly. A brief bootleg recording that consisted of seven tracks of varying styles. A studio recording has been eagerly awaited by nobody for quite some time, but the duo has yet to regroup. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+gods+themselves">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
