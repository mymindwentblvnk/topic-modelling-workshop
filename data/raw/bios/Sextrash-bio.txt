SEXTRASH was created in Belo Horizonte during 1987 by former SARCOFAGO drummer D.D. Crazy. 
Many of the band's members were previously in a band called Insulter before the formation of Sextrash. The group debuted in 1989 with the three track 'XXX' EP for the French Maggot label. The band's final album output would be 1992's 'Funeral Serenade' as singer Pussy Ripper (a.k.a. Oswald Scheid) was killed in an auto accident in 1997. 
SEXTRASH announced a return to action in the Spring of 2005, signing a new album deal with Cogumelo Records. The band at this juncture comprised singer Doom, guitarist Marck, bass player Kruegger and Quake on the drums. One of the re-activated group's first moves was to act as openers for KREATOR in their hometown, Belo Horizonte. SEXTRASH album recordings in late 2005, 'Rape From Hell', would be produced by former SARCOFAGO bassist Gerald Minelli. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sextrash">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
