Mercury Eye is passion and intensity, energy and emotion, mixing the strength of extreme metal genres and the intensity of symphonic and gothic metal. 
Heavy riffing, powerful and hammering drums, impressive strings, melancholic violins and a stunning leading voice covering a wide range of styles, from whispers to opera.
A wall of sound, creating a perfect frame for the words, inspired by the reflection of existence, loss, passion, fear and pain.
The promo is recorded by Gianluca lo Presti at Loto Studio (Tying Tiffany, Ataraxia) and mastered by Riccardo “Paso” Pasini at Studio73 (At the Soundawn, Ephel Duath, Extrema).
