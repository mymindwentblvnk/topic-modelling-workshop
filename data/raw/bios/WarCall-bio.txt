WarCall plays a mixture of death-black and thrash metal in the style of Dissection, At The Gates and Ensiferum.  The outfits’ debut album, "Demonarchy", presents 11 songs of pure war metal that will rally the troops with its epic leads, striking vocals and enthralling rhythms. The result is as aggressive, brutal and unpredictable as the human nature it depicts, representing this vision through personal experience and historical fact. 
 
WarCall have already earned many stripes with tours featuring bands such as KALMAH, CATEMENIA and IMPALED NAZARENE, just to name a few... 

With an album in hand, this road-craving band has the tools it needs to push it’s limits and reach it’s audience.  After a very successful tour across eastern Canada in the spring of 2011, WarCall will soon be ready to enter the studio to record a follow up for the critically acclaimed Demonarchy, released in 2009.
