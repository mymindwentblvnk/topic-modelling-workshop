Lost in Darkness was formed at the beginning of 2004 essentially with the idea of mould under metals sound, funereal and existencialist concepts linked with agony feelings related to the death and its subjective meaning. 

In principle the band was under influence of recognized bands like Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir , creating their first tracks named:

 An Elixir For my Death , Whisper of Agony, Lost in Darkness and others, which were showed in their first presentation done in 2005 January together with important local bands of metal scene stage such as Tenebrarum, Athanator, Bless The Silence and Vital Escence. 


Later , they entered in an internal reorganization with important changes in the line up and music that with a dark atmosphere, density in their riffs and harmonious melodies brings them to My Dying Bride first album sound: As the Flowers Withers icon in the Doom/Death Metal, genre that now Lost In Darkness have in their sound. 

By mid-2005, had a new presentation together with Athanator and Bless the Silence, this time to show their new and distinctive sound launching tracks like Labyrinth Of Laments, Ad Perpétuam Rei Memóriam, Basium Mortis, My Last Words and a new adaptation of An Elixir and Lost In Darkness, having a good acceptance by the people.
