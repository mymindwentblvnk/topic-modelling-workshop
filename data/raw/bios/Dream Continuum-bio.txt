Dream Continuum is a collaboration between Travis Stewart a.k.a. Machinedrum and Jim Coles a.k.a. Om Unit, who was behind the Phillip D Kick footwork jungle tracks in 2011. The meeting came about when Travis and Jim realised they were working in parallel on the same concept of finding the sweet spot between mid-90â€™s euphoric jungle and footwork, so naturally they set about working out how to find it together. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dream+Continuum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
