Black Devil is Bernard Fevre (although credited as a collaboration with Jacky Giordano under the respective pseudonyms Joachim Sherylee and Junior Claristidge), known for a six-track album of spooky electro-disco entitled Disco Club. 
Originally released on Italy's Out label in 1978, it became somewhat well-known in the disco underground despite its scarcity. 
It was made manually in a recording studio in the suburbs of Paris using synths and occasional tape loops and a drummer. No midi or computers.
According to an interview given by Bernard Fevre in January 2007, Jacky Giordano only financed the recording sessions. His being credited as co-composer was just a deal for recouping his financial investment.
A copy eventually fell into the hands of the Rephlex label's P.P. Roy and soon won the hearts of Richard James and Luke Vibert. Rather than do a straight reissue, Rephlex opted to first release a 12" including four tracks from the original vinyl; after that, they annoyingly trickled out the two other tracks, along with a couple outtakes and a remix from Luke Vibert (under his Kerrier District guise), via 12" and CD single releases that featured different track lists. 


Bernard Fevre came back with a new opus in 2006 under the guise of Black Devil Disco Club although some remixed versions taken from this second album were released under the original Black Devil monicker by the same label.

Since 2006, Bernard has released multiple other albums, as late as 2020, under the Black Devil Disco Club name, which can be found as a separate entry on Last.fm. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Devil">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
