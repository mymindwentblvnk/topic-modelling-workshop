SPITBLOOD is an Estonian metal band combining fast and aggressive drumming, massive rhythm-based guitar riffs and guttural screaming that brighten up into refreshing melodic parts with clean vocals and guitar harmonies. 

SPITBLOOD had its foundation laid in the year 2003. In 2005, after 2 years of participating in band competitions and performing live in numerous places around Estonia, SPITBLOOD took the time off, returned to the cold depths of their rehearsal room and began writing completely new material. The new songs were completed one by one and the older material was also polished and improved. 7 songs were picked out and the band headed out to record their self-release Questionable Ethics.

SpitBlood's debut album "Questionable Ethics" out now!
