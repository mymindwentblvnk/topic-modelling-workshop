Members: Kyle Cesari, Chris Marron, Juan Diaz, Jon Secor, Justin Ravare, Matt Brown

Beneath The Genocide is a giant among many. They have persevered through many struggles. BTG has gone through much change in the past several years, from line-up changes, to different sounds, they have shown that they can last through the toughest of times. Its been said that it's not where you have been that defines you. It is, however, what makes the man he is today. We all have to learn from our mistakes, but never perish in them, but grow stronger with every bit of knowledge we obtain. The members of BTG have become living proof of just this. With the vocals of Kyle Cesari, keys/orchestration by Jon Secor, Justin Ravare on bass, drummer Matt Brown, original member/founder Chris Marron, and Juan Diaz rounding out the pack with guitars, the band is truly an amazing spectacle, with an on-stage presence that is undenyable. With the debut release of their demo "Salvation." in October 2008 and the much anticipated LP "TIDES.", they've proved to be a band of great musical conscience. They're not stopping anytime soon, and you've just seen the begining of Beneath The Genocide. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beneath+The+Genocide">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
