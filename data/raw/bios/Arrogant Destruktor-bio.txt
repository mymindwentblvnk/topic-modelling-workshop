Arrogant Destruktor was formed in 2012 by A.T (vocals) and A.R (guitars, bass, flute, timpani). In February 2013 the band embarked on recording a 3 track demo with Steve Powell providing drums. Carl Stokes recorded and mixed it in a shed in rural Shropshire.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arrogant+Destruktor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
