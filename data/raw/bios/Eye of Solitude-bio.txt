Eye Of Solitude are a doom/death metal band from London UK, formed in April 2010. Some bands they share various similarities in sound with are My Dying Bride(early), Ahab, My Shameful and Swallow the Sun, which are just a few examples of the different elements of death metal, doom metal and also melody they incorporate in their music.

Their music is inspired by emotional distress, inner pain and a cruel combination of negativity and grief. Dark shapes that terrorize the soul and keep it captive on the altar of suffering, until when not being able to breathe any longer, it finds its end - a supreme escape towards peace and eternal rest.

The Eye Of Solitude is the heart of forests where unsettled spirits dwell, it is the fear within, the carnal ripping of every thought when abandoned in despair, it is nightmare and enlightenment, a fearsome tide that carries the soul and mind onto dark realms of insanity.

They have currently released three full-lengths; their debut album "The Ghost" in 2011, "Sui Caedere" in 2012 and "Canto III" in 2013. They have also released two EPs; "Awoken by Crows" in 2012 and "The Deceit" in 2013.
