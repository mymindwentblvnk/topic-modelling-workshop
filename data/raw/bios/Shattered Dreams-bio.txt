Oxford, UK based Pop-Punk band Shattered Dreams take their ‘authentic punk sound’ (Nightshift 2010) and combine it with a ‘modern-day twinge’ (REPEAT, 2010). The band as it now stands, (Marnie Wood- Vocals, James Macke- Guitar, Matt Oliver- Bass and James Coulson- Drums) have been together and performing for the last 6 months; the band itself has been established within Oxford for the past 2 years where they have played at the O2 Academy 5 times and other large venues such as The Regal.

Their ‘old-school punk sound’ (Nightshift, 2010) takes advantage of catchy guitar riffs and powerful vocals and takes influence from the likes of Debbie Harry, The Ramones and The Runaways. With the release of new EP Get Outta My Way the band aspires to take itself to the next level by building upon its very solid grounding within Oxford's vibrant music scene. The EP will be found on ITunes from September and will be able to buy from Truck Store in Oxford and Rapture in Witney as well as from the band directly.

Having secured endorsements from Dovetail Strings and a place on Ashdown's ‘featured artists’ page, the aim for 2011 is to continue obtaining sponsorship from similar world-renowned companies and branch out further into the UK to build upon an already solid fan base.
