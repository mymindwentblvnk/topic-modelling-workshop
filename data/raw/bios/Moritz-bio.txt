A classic 80's British AOR act that for reasons unknown didn't make the grade which was a real crime. The release of City Streets which has gone down a storm. So inspired by the resurge in interest, 2010 sees the release of a new album "Undivided" that has definitely been worth waiting for.

Have a look at the promo video. Shot in Londons East End, this rare promo footage of Moritz features the lead track from their debut EP Can't stop loving You. Filmed in 1987, this video helped the EP become a total sell out, and vinyl copies now exchange hands on the internet for over Â£50.
 
Now thanks to the many internet AOR sites, Moritz are regarded as arguably the finest UK exponents of true AOR rock. It is due to this overwhelming support that all 6 original members reformed back in 2009 for the first time in 21 years the result of which is an outstanding album "Undivided" that is now available.
