The musical composition begins in early 2007 and after many attempts to form a proper band the duo starts working on the first full-length album. In 2009 Alexander joins the project as drummer, and Stev as keyboard player. In 2010 the first album called "Embrace My Winter" is born. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Whispers+Of+Fate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
