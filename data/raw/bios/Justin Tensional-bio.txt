Justin Tensional is the brainchild of producer duo Mo Diggidy and Igotchabrotha. The Atlanta natives have both embarked on a supernatural journey full of joyous moments of creative bliss. These works represent the true meaning of "mustard seed faith." This world of dance music has allowed us to explore sound in ways we had yet not thought of. Combining years of musicianship across multiple instruments and genres has led us here at this point in time and space.

The two have amassed an amazing and impressive resume of artists they've worked with over the years. Their expertise in audio production/engineering has paved the way for numerous tracking, mixing and mastering opportunities which include artists like: Monica, Missy Elliott, Young Thug, Money Man, Trouble, Bankroll Fresh, Big Gipp, Gangsta Boo, Canton Jones and a list of others that would compile a list too long for a bio! With 17 years of preparation, we're ready for every opportunity placed before us.
