Named after the legendary Dr Who episode from the 1975, this band has been created to push music to its limits. Crushing doom, blastbeats, harsh electronics/vocals and a beautiful prog feel combine to push boundaries a little further in extremity. Noise artist Stuntcock had been looking for some extreme musicians to accompany his electronic racket, calling on his old cohort Seddon, and two travelling Sontarans, Rooster and Si. After hours of jamming, songs have been structured, all at approx 15-20 mins but as all great symphonies, divided into movements. You will love or hate this band, there is NO middle ground. They start the first step of the Sontaran invasion on Dec 4th.

The debut ep a split with Stuntcock is available via Future Noise Records
