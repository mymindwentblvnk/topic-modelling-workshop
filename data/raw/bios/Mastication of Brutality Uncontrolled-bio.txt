BIO
In 2007, Mastication of Brutality Uncontrolled was planned as a side project of the members Danny (Guitar) & Flo (Drums/Guitar) [both Incesticide] and Daniel (Bass) [Provocation], but after the first jam sessions the three musicians stopped jamming due to a lack of time.

In November of 2009, Flo (Guitar) [Incesticide, Cervet, Provocation] and Basti (Drums) [Take Fucking Action] started some jam sessions with the intention of having fun by playing brutal shit.
This combo worked out well so they decided to write songs in the vein of their favorite bands, such as INHERIT DISEASE, DYING FETUS, DISGORGE and many more.

From this point the band MASTICATION OF BRUTALITY UNCONTROLLED was founded and no side-project anymore, rather an intense band with the aim of playing brutal live shows and having fun by presenting their music to the rest of the world.
Soon bass-player Nasar [Carnal Decay], joined the brutal duo, and the three continued to write songs, while they were searching for a vocalist.
At the beginning of 2010, Laudi (Vocals) [Hateprison] joined MOBU. With this constellation the band played their first gig at the Eisenwahn Warmup 2010. 
After that Show Chris (Vocals) [Retaliation] joined the Band to complete the Line-Up.

After playing a lot of intense live shows, Laudi and Chris decided to leave the band in 2013 for different reasons, so Manuel [Take Fucking Action, Provocation] joined MOBU to fill in the vocal spot. The former session bass player Basti S. replaced Nasar to play bass full-time.
As for now, the band is finished with the recordings for their debut full-length "Preemptive Space Warfare" and is currently searching for a label to work with.
