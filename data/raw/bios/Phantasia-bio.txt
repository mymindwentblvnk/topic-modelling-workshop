There are 5 bands named Phantasia.  

-1-
A dream-pop band based in New York City. This 5-piece group is heavily inspired by the romantic musings of New-Wave superheroes like The Cure and Strawberry Switchblade. 

-2-
American psychedelic band from Kansas City, Missouri. Their two albums (phantasia and walkenhorst & de pugh) comprise unreleased material laid down in the Damon studios from 1969 into the early seventies. The sound here is predominantly gentle psychy hippie-rock but with the odd heavier moments as witness the excellent slow burnin' psychedelic workout A Stumbling Dragon. This track turns up again as the second half of the wistful Genena on the second album. Chasing Now The Flying Time also get's an airing on both albums. Other highlights - the siren effects on the rocky Ride Me, the phasing and bubbling sounds on I'm Alive have an almost 13th Floor Elevator aura, giving the first LP an edge over the second. It originally appeared as a 'No label' demo Transparent Face in 1969. It was actually the same group as Trizo - 50 and some of the tracks on A Psychedelic By... were from the Trizo - 50 album and not from Transparent Face.
