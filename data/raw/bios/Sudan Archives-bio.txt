Brittney Denise Parks, better known as Sudan Archives, is a California-based violinist and vocalist, who writes, plays, and produces her own music. Drawing inspiration from the Sudanese fiddle, she is self-taught on the violin, and her unique songs also fold in elements of R&B, and experimental electronic music. 

Parks grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio, US, where she "messed around with instruments in the house" and took up violin in the fourth grade, eventually teaching herself how to play the instrument by ear. When she discovered the violin playing style of Northeast Africa, her eyes opened to the possibilities of the instrument. "The way they played it was different from classical music. I resonated with the style, and I was like, 'Maybe I can use this style with electronic music,'" she says. She has released two projects to date, including the self-titled Sudan Archives in July 2017, and Sink in 2018, both on Stones Throw Records.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sudan+Archives">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
