The band was formed in 1993 by Fog as a one man project/cult. In 1994, Hashcloud, Lechis and Reston joined in and it became a band. With this line-up their one and only demo "My Visions in the Forest" was recorded. The demo stood out amongst the few South American black metal acts as having a very mid-90's European symphonic black metal sound. 

The band had hoped to release "My Visions in the Forest" on vinyl and record a new album in 2008, but have since parted ways.The DVD "Live in Piracicaba" was released in 2008 by the band in an unknown limited amount of numbers 

Currently the demo "My Visions in the Forest" is only available on the split with Miasthenia entitled "Visions Of Nocturnal Tragedies" on Evil Horde Records (EH002).
