Magic Man was a band from Providence, Rhode Island and later from Boston, Massachusetts that formed around 2009. They began as a duo who grew out of idle hours during a summer in France spent volunteering on different organic farms. Their self-produced debut album Real Life Color was released in 2010. Three years since the release of Real Life Color, Magic Man has evolved from two college students behind a laptop into a five-person band. The band, originally comprised of Alex Caplow and Sam Lee, added Justine Bowe, Daniel Radin, and Joey Sulkowski into the mix, and have added a new indie pop/rock style to their synth-pop roots. Magic Man released their new EP, You Are Here , last September and are planning to release an album soon. Radin left in early 2014, to play with his other band, The Novel Ideas, and he was replaced by Gabe Goodman. Alex previously played with a band called gulls, Sam writes music under the name The Tumbled Sea, and Justine writes music as Photocomfort.
