Fregath is a Hungarian hard rock/heavy metal/thrash metal band founded in 2006 by father and son László Lázár and Gábor Lázár guitarists. Soon joined drummer Adam Dechatel, who also plays in the extreme metal band Terraformer Deluxe. Attila Földi became the singer, after first trying to play the drums, but fortunately he changed to vocals. The last one to join was Péter Gyuricza from the death metal band Goretrust.
In the beginning Fregath played traditional hard rock with touches of the late Metallica-kind-of heavy metal. 

After Péter Gyuricza left the band, László Lázár switched to bass and ex-Legacy member Dávid Komlósi (also in Heroic, Mi Voltunk Azok, Advisory) was recruited as lead guitarist. With him joining the style developed into classic heavy metal mixed with 80s thrash metal, yet the vocals remained more rock-oriented.
