3.) The now-defunkt Finnish Submerged (1993-2001), who hailed from the city of Oulu, known for its many raw and energetic rock bands. They recorded three EPs - their first one for a small local label E-Records, and the next two for the famed and praised weirdo label Bad Vugum - and a single for Bad Afro. Their last release saw light in the form of a song, No Motive, featured on a compilation by the Finnish rock zine Sue. The band split up shortly after. Singer/guitarist Mikko Juntunen later formed Atomivakoojat (now also defunkt), while second guitarist Jasu Leskel√§ went on to form Universal Audio Attack Orchestra.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Submerged">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
