The Garden is an American duo from Orange County, California, formed in 2011 by twin brothers Wyatt and Fletcher Shears. The duo released their debut album The Life and Times of a Paperclip in 2013, with several smaller releases following. In 2015, the group released their second studio album Haha along with the lead single "All Smiles Over Here :)" to critical acclaim after being signed to Epitaph Records. They released their third album Mirror Might Steal Your Charm on March 30, 2018. Their fourth album, Kiss My Super Bowl Ring, was released on March 13th, 2020.

The band is known for their fast, punk-influenced two-piece bass and drum songs, with both their music and image being characterized by "DIY principles, thrift store-cum-glam fashion style and a vast list of influences." The brothers classify their sound as "vada vada," a philosophy which Wyatt Shears describes as “an idea that represents pure creative expression, that disregards all previously made genres and ideals”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Garden">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
