From Sweden, comes SKELETAL SPECTRE...3 ghastly apparitions from the voids of eternal darkness. Their goal is a simple one...to play crushing horror DOOM METAL mixed with other influences and eerie sounds to come up with something they feel is their own. Prepare to be haunted as the band has just released their debut CD on Razorback Recordings which is titled "Tomb Coven". Do you hear the sound of the spectre? It's coming for you...
