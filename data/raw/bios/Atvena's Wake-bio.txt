ATVENA'S WAKE was originally formed back in late 2006 and have quickly built up a strong following. They play a solid tight strong style of contemporary Metal music. They incorporate many influences of Thrash Metal, Death Metal, Hardcore & even a bit of Power Metal at times. There are many heavy ended grooves that dominate the bands sound, which I was really digging a lot. They mix in some melodic parts along with all thick aggressive Death Metal. The vocals also follow the same path as the music. They have harsh screechy Hardcore sounds blended with low ended Death Metal & mid ranged melodic Thrash & Power Metal vocals. This is a band that is definitely on the rise & we should be seeing a lot of them in the near future, cause they are going to dominate <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Atvena%27s+Wake">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
