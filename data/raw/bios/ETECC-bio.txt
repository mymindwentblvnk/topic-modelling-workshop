Etecc is a Metal and Hard Rock band from Wolfsburg, Germany, that was formed in 2009

In January 2009 the three band members Marc, Souhaieb, and Timo decided to rent a rehearsal room for occasional jamming sessions in the old slaughterhouse in Wolfsburg, Germany. After playing together for two month they were tired of having neither a singer nor a bassist, and so decided, that it was time to go look for a bass player in the local metal-scene. They soon got some calls regarding their looking-for-paper, but one of them happened to be the bassist and singer Rouven. The band and Rouven soon aranged to hang out a bit and find out about each others visions.

After some month of getting to know each other and becoming something you would call a band, they found out that we all had the same idea of where our music should go and that they were all somehow connected in a way, without knowing it.

The next thing the band had to deal with, was creating a name that was not your average mainstream in the offstream, evil, metal-band name. they were looking for something that did not include some random word of destruction or death, and at the same time did not suggest anything â€“ a name free of any colour to begin with and yet, concise, short and expressive.

In december of 2009, eight months after the band had been formed the first three demo-tracks were recorded by the band itself using Rouven's own recording-equipement in their rehearsal room in the Slaughterhouse. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Etecc">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
