In the '60s, Sonny Sharrock was one of the top avant-garde guitarist and Miles Davis, Don Cherry and Herbie Mann all made use of his intense and wild playing. This classic album featuring his wife Linda on vocals was originally released on the Atco label in 1975. The duo's free-from avant-garde guitar and vocals are blended with fusion/electric grooves on Moog, Rhodes piano, Clavinet and percussion. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sonny+&+Linda+Sharrock">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
