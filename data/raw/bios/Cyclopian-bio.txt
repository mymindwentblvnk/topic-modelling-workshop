Cyclopian was a London based band comprising individuals from different musical backgrounds, rooted within the genre of Metal.

With a host of varied influences and musical interests, they found common ground with the desire to create music that is emotionally honest and heavy.

Their aim was to create a sound that is minimalistic and simple in nature, where the overall sound holds highest precedence and the sum is greater than any of it's parts.

Thematically based on esoteric subjects, their music aims to resemble the intangible experience of the unconscious mind.
