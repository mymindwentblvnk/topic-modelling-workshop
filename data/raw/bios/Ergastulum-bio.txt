Ergastulum is a progressive death metal band from Gjøvik, Norway.

Started out as a middle school garage band during november 2009, early Ergastulum was most busy about making fast, raw songs. Neither of the bandmembers took the band too seriously and just had fun playing together, until fall 2011. At some point, they decided it was time to actually achieve something. They started experimenting with unusual time signatures, dissonances, and incorporating elements from everything from jazz to funk.

They are currently making material for a concept album about a slave in an ergastulum, and his physical as well as psychological experiences there. The album will be called "Welcome to the Ergastulum".
