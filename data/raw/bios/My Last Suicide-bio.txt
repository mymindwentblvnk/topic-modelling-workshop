The band My Last Suicide was formed in March 2009. At the beginning we did only covers and were enjoying in our rehearsal without any gigs. After a while we had some changes in band members ‘till we find a final crew. Members of MLS are: Goran Maric - guitar, Aleksandar Talic -guitar, Danijel Knezevic -bass, Dragan Golubovic -vocal and Aleksandar Zrnic –drums. The band went through the ice and after a few gigs came up to positive comments. For now we had recorded two songs: ‘Betrayed Souls’ and ‘Ignored’. Four more songs are ready for recording. We are hopping and trying to make and release EP for start and later, who knows, maybe CD or something. The sound is still in experimentation but we strive for melodic death metal. Any help and support is welcome. Greetings from MLS crew.

-Gojko Smitran (Solo Guitar),
-Aleksandar Talic (Rhytm Guitar),
