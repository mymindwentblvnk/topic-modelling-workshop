Yes, they do exist.  The band that doesn't just fit into one category and knows how to inspire with its powerful and cleverly arranged songs. But that's not all:
Bananafishbones also possesses the talent for catchy pop tunes as their chart success "Come To Sin" proves. Everyone who owns a T.V. set must have heard "Come To Sin" at least once because in 1998 that single was the soundtrack for a C&A commercial by Roman Kuhn that embellished the commercial cluster on MTV and other channels.
But even without the commercial, the song "Come to Sin" established itself as an excellent pop song.  It entered the top 50 of the media control single charts; and the immediate rise to position 32(KW2) as the frequent airplay and position 36 in the airplay charts speak for themselves.
The press and the critics also welcomed the band with open arms. According to the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung" the Bananafishbones beat the Guano Apes.  Apparently, it doesn't take more than just three virtuosic musicians to produce an imaginative and original sound.
Others praised the mix of loveliness and gruffness, harmony and anarchy (MM) and attested that Bananafishbones isn't only the most important but also the best band of the county. 
They also made the Soundtrack for the German soccer Films "Die Wilden Kerle 1 - 3".
