There are several artists named Hands

1) Hands is the drone/noise side-project of Swedish producer Axel Willner, aka The Field. 

2) Hands were a North Dakota group who played a range of music from instrumental acoustic to post-rock and metal. The band- singer and guitarist Shane Ochsner, guitarist Jerik Hendrickson, bassist Chris Schwartz, and drummer Josh Silbernagel- formed in 2007 and recorded and self-released their debut EP, 'The Everlasting' a year later. In 2009 they partnered with Oort Records to release their first full-length album, 'The Sounds of Earth'. Later the same year, Hands signed with Facedown Records and went on to release two more albums, 'Creator' and 2011's 'Give Me Rest'. Jerik Hendrickson left the group that year and Hands continued as a three-piece before breaking up. Ochsner went on to form Everything in Slow Motion, while Josh Silbernagel recorded with the band Glower. 

3) Hands are an LA-based chillwave outfit signed to Kill Rock Stars. Hands began as a two-piece from Philadelphia before heading west to add a bassist and drummer. They have played shows across the country including stops at SXSW, CMJ and Deluna Fest. They headlined Echo Park Rising, recorded a session with Daytrotter, and have opened for the likes of Deerhoof, DeVotchKa, Foster the People, and Kimbra. Their debut album, 'Synesthesia', was released in 2013, and staked them a spot in TIME Magazine’s “11 Bands You Don’t Know (But Should)” List that year

4) Hands was a progressive rock/symphonic prog artist from United States. A short-lived symphonic American band from Texas whose sound has been compared to GENTLE GIANT, JETHRO TULL, and HAPPY THE MAN, as well as the inevitable nods to early KANSAS, HANDS were actually an off-shoot of the even more obscure rock/fusion project PRISM.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hands">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
