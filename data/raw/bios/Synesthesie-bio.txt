Synesthesie, initially called Skull X, was created in 2003 by Brice Ramondenc (guitar), (Clément Château bass guitar) and Camille Alterescu (vocals and guitar). Camille Faure-Brac (Drums and keyboards) joined them in 2006.
In 2007, they recorded a Demo-CD (with 11 tracks), Horrors of an Old Turntable, with the participation of Stéphanie Montel (Naos) on two tracks.

In December 2008, the band started to record their second album, Alterae Orae Exclusus. The compositions are longer and more studied than in their previous record, there are a greater diversity concerning the influences and the instruments played (flutes, accordion, didgeridoo, various percussions...) and the lyrics, written in Latin language, are inspired by Classic Roman poetry (an ode from Horace makes up the lyrics of two tracks).
