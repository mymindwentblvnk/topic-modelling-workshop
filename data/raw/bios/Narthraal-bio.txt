Narthraal is a death metal band from Reykjavík, Iceland that formed in 2012. Their debut EP 'Blood Citadel' was released on February 5, 2014. The band's music revolves around the fictional universe of Narthraal. Narthraal is a hell-like expanse of rocks, lava and blood-red sands, inhabited by various races and species of demons all dominated by the fallen who dreams of vengeance as he resides in the mighty blood citadel, bound by glowing red chains, continuously plotting and planning for the day the chains are broken and his black wings pierce the heavens once more.
