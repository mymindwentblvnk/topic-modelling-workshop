African-American R&B singer. Born Shannon Jonell Showes in Cincinnati, OH.

2003 saw Jonell with her first hit Round and Round off producer Hi-Tek's album Hi-Teknology. Later that year Jonell was set to release her debut album on the Def Soul label. Her first single So Whassup featured a guest appearance by Redman. The album was never released, and in 2005 her webpage on the Def Soul website was no longer accessible.

She resurfaced in late 2005 with a blog on MySpace where she talks about working on her new album.
