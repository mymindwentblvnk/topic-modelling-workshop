Horsemen of the Apocalypse was a brutal and technical death metal/grindcore band from Norwalk, California. They started as a metalcore band in 2002 and that year put out a demo called "Soldiers of the Cross". They reinvented their sound taking influence from bands like Aborted, Dying Fetus, Pig Destroyer and Cannibal Corpse in their "Death Gospel" demo in 2006. Masina and Art are now in the project Primordium. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Horsemen+of+the+Apocalypse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
