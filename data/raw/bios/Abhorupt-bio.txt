Comprised of 4 young individuals, Abhorupt is a progressive technical death metal band centered in Winnipeg, Manitoba which was formed of its current full lineup in 2010. Abhorupt's musical focus is to write technical music that is engaging to both themselves and the audience. Characterized by blast beats, time and tempo changes, breakdowns and themes of misanthropy, Abhorupt is very much a "do what you feel" band, without setting any musical/thematic boundaries or rules.
