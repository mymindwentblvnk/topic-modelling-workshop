History  
The history of Fatal Sound Project dates back to december 2005 when Harri V채yrynen and Joni Tanskala started to look for a line-up for a new band since they had buried their previous band project. Harri had earlier been doing both singing and the rhythm guitars but they both felt they needed another guitar player to help Harri focus fully on his vocals. They got Juho Kukkonen, Harri`s old high school friend to do the guitars. All they needed now was a drummer, a bass player, and a rehearsal place. They didnt have to look long. Mikko Salonp채채 became the drummer and Jaakko Kuotesaho, an old friend of Juho became the bass player. After the line-up was complete they took over Juho`s former band`s rehearsal lair and started to act under the name Claim to Bleed. This name was just a line from one their songs and nobody actually knew that did it have any actual meaning. They did one demo (Smile) in the spring of 2006 and played a few gigs with this line-up. They were displeased with the quality of the first demo since they knew that the band had potential for better. New songs were written and the music got faster and more aggressive, it became clear to everyone that changes had to be made and Mikko had to leave the band. The name was changed to Fatal Sound Project and Kauko Kuusisalo became the new drummer.
