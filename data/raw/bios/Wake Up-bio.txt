Wake Up was formed in 2004 by lead singer Dom Bergeron and drummer Alex Lafrance, under the project name ¨Timeline¨. Timeline was a studio project intended to record a dozen of Bergeron's songs to sell them on line before he joined the Canadian forces. 

Two years passed before they made music together again.  When bergeron left the forces, Lafrance - who had played with several bands before and after the Timeline project - was very busy with the Iron Maiden tribute Aces High. It took a couple of months before they re-united and formed a new band with Bergeron’s brother, Tom.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wake+Up">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
