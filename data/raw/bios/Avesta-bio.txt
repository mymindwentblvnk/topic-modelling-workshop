There are two artists known as Avesta: 

1) Swiss born Avesta joins the Musical Freedom family with his aptly-titled, "Arena". A track equal parts euphoric, anthemic piano and blinding, chainsaw mayhem, "Arena" captures a perfect contemporary mix of progressive writing with electro aesthetic. A staple in TiÃ«sto's sets for the past few months, and picking up early support from Kaskade, Nicky Romero and Tommy Trash, Arena is fit for electrifying a festival crowd and blowing up rooms of any size. Sure to be a favorite well into summer, "Arena" drops Feb. 27th

2) Heavy metal band from Iran <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Avesta">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
