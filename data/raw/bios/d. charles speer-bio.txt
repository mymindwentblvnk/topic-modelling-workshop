D. Charles Speer is American singer and guitarist David Charles Shuford (born and raised in Atlanta, GA). He also records as D. Charles Speer & The Helix. 

After moving to New York City in the early 90s, Shuford forged a path as a musician adept in multiple sounds and styles. A member of the No-Neck Blues Band for many years, he has also engaged his mind and fingers in other groups such as Enos Slaughter, The Suntanama, Egypt Is The Magick #, and Coach Fingers. Through a steady series of home recordings, the Speer trajectory began to take shape in the early 2000's. Assembling of masses of vibration bearing wood was needed to fulfill one manâ€™s band obligations. The full instrumental ensemble of a Middle Eastern belly dance troupe and a selection of voices from a Cajun band were thereby smashed together to engender a sound wildly alive. After a self released debut solo LP Some Forgotten Country in 2007, Speer then sought out a public performance outlet with the killing-est band in the land, the Helix (recording as D. Charles Speer & The Helix). His second solo LP Arghiledes  brought a return focus upon acoustic instrumentation, with a still healthy dose of electric effects and speaker fry.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/D.+Charles+Speer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
