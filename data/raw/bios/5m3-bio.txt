5M3 started out in the year 2000 under the name Gutfuck, from the ashes of Infected Entrails (a drumcomputer-based grindcore act). After replacing the mechanical skin beater for a real live one they recorded their first demo in 2001 and altered their style to grindmetalcore. After finding a steady line-up the band recorded their second demo in 2003, still perfecting their musical direction. At the end of 2005 they recorded another promo and their style had changed so much since their origin that they changed the band name to 5M3 : 5 KUUB in dutch (five cubicle meters).
 
5m3 plays deathgrind metalcore. The foundation of the band today can be found in heavy metalcore thatâ€™s laced with old school death metal and grindcore. Think Crowbar meets Cephalic Carnage meet Bolts Thrower with Suffocation dressing. Heavy riffing, occasional blasts, tight and heavy, often with either a certain dragging vibe or a mechanical vibe. The music is completed by low gurgling vocals.
