3. Wreck were an independent rock band from Chicago, Illinois made up of Dean Schlabowske (later of the Waco Brothers) on electric guitar and vocals, Bart Flores on drums, and Keith Brammer (from Die Kreuzen and Boy Dirt Car) on bass guitar. Kurt Moore (The Won't, Primasonic) played bass on House of Boris, the Mikey single, and the original, unreleased version of El Mundo De Los Niños. They released three records on Chicago's Wax Trax! label under the banner of Play It Again Sam. Wreck's two EPs, single, and one LP feature the distinctive production sound of Steve Albini and were a diversion for Wax Trax, which was known as an outlet for industrial dance music.
