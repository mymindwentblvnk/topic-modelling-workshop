Defied is a punk rock band from Long Beach/Wilmington, California. They were formed in December 2001 by guitarist, George Romano; bassist, Melvin Trinidad; and drummer, Manuel Mora. Defied soon inducted Brian Zuniga as lead vocalist in February 2002. They soon recorded an independently produced, self-titled EP in 2003. Later that year, second guitarist Regan Cacho, joined the band's lineup. The band approaches punk rock with influences of heavy metal, hardcore punk, rock n' roll, and blues.

In 2004, Smelvis Records (formed by Elvis Cortez of Left Alone) added Defied to their independent label along with numerous underground bands in southern California. They have since recorded a split record with ska/punk band Matamoska under the label's name and has played many shows including venues such as the Knitting Factory in Hollywood, CA; The Allen Theatre in South Gate, California; and BB King's Club in Universal City, California.
The band is currently preparing their new, independently produced EP, to be released in early 2007.
