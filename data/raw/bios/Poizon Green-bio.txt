Poizon Green Is A Power/Thrash Metal Band From Bangladesh. They are the pioneers of thrash metal in Bangldesh.

The band Poizon Green was formed back in December, 1998. Drummer Mollik, vocals Tanvyr and the guitar player Shifa, these three oldest friends, living at the same geographical area in Dhaka city, got together at Mollik's place one evening and came up with a decision to form a Power/Speed/Thrash (with a bit Deathish) metal band which will represent hatred, aggression, death and social circumstances in their music. Members of the band were hugely inspired and influenced by the legendary local band Rockstrata including other western bands such as Slayer, Sepultura, Pantera, Black Sabbath, Motorhead, Machinehead, Megadeth, Iron Maiden, Cannibal Corpse, Morbid Angel etc.

The Initial (Old) Lineup Of The Band Was:
*Guitars - Shifa
*Vocals - Tanvyr
*Drums - Mollik
*Bass - Loton

The band started practicing at Mollik's house with some poor quality sound equipments that used to bug the neighborhoods a bit. Sometime in 1999 Bassist Loton left the band due to some personal reasons and Enayet filled the gap within a couple of months. They started doing shows since 2000. But in the year 2001 Enayet leaves the band and then there comes Sourav joining as a Bassist. But again in the end of the year 2002 Sourav leaves Dhaka for higher studies abroad.

The band took a break for couple of months waiting for a perfect match for the band as a permanent bassist, they met Sunny. Sunny is still kicking with Poizon Green. Till now they did more than 100 shows in most of the auditoriums of Dhaka (the capital of Bangladesh)

The Current Lineup Of The Band Is:
*Guitars - Shifa
*Vocals - Tanvyr
*Drums - Mollik
*Bass - Sunny
