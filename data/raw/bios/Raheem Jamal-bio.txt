"Radio" Raheem Jamal is a Roxbury, MA (home of Hip Hop legend Edo. G) veteran MC who has cut his teeth most recently as a frontman for two super groups; Project Move and Electric Company. In Project Move, Raheem rocked along side Moe Pope (Mission, Crown City Rockers), Anonymous and Beyonder (7L & Esoteric, Bladerunners, Vinyl Thug Music). The Electric Company consisted of all three members of Project Move, Insight and Dagha. Project Move's "Love Gone Wrong/Butterfly Theory" and Electric's "Life s A Struggle" became instant cult favorites in Japan and Europe (specifically France) and Raheem and the rest gained critical acclaim. He has toured extensively with both groups supporting many upper echelon and like sounding artists including KRS-1, Jurassic 5, Talib Kweli, Digable Planets, Little Brother, Slum Village, Common, Pharoah Monch, CL Smooth, Jeru the Damaja, Special Ed, Royce Da 5'9", Big Daddy Kane, Edan and more. Raheem Jamal is now ready to spread his creative wings and stand out on his own two. Entirely backed by the lavish production of Hip Hop maverick Raydar Ellis (best known for his critically acclaimed debut album "Late Pass" and production for 7L & Esoteric and Dr. Dre proteges GodBody), and hot off the trail of his stand out "Not The One" single, Jamal paints beautiful pictures with words, that dance and flow over the soundscape. Sometimes positive, sometimes pessimistic but always truthful and thoughtful, "Boombox" is how rap albums used to be. How rap albums should be; One MC, one producer, a couple of their boys. Songs about life, love, struggle and strength... Brick Records proudly presents "Boombox." Look for Raheem Jamal & Raydar Ellis as part of URB's next 1,000 online promotional campaign. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Raheem+Jamal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
