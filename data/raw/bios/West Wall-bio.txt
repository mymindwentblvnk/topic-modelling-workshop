American death/war metal band formed in 2005 as a side project by members from Dominion USA, Ossuary Insane, and Convulsus USA. The first recording was titled 'Blitzkrieg Symphony #1'. The album was themed by the battles of WWII and focused on the German aspect of the war and its heroes. 

The band became a working, touring band in 2007 after original drummer Mike was replaced by Steve Martin (Defile USA). It was with this new line up where potential was found for the band to reach new heights both in stability and musical composition. 2008 saw the release of 'Conquest or Death'. This album is heralded as being along the lines of Amon Amarth, Destroyer666 and highly reminiscent of Bolt Thrower and the like. 

'Conquest or Death' remains true to the bands battle themed approach to song topics while also expanding to include other historic and epic battles. The album makes its focus more upon vicious and costly battles that range from the battle of the Teutoburg Forest to the battlefields of Vietnam and the struggles, horrors, fears, and victories of those who were involved in them. 'Conquest or Death' remains their most powerful release to date.
