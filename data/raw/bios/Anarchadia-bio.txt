After a successful album with Paindemonium in Egypt, Raafat Atasi returned to Damascus, Syria in 2011 , and joined forces with Mhd. Siam and Sami Abo Loah to form an extreme Syrian Metal band. At the time, the view for the band's future was yet unclear. But after composing several songs from various genres,and with Alaa Abdullah's contribution , the band members setteled on embracing Thrash Music as their roaring language,to express complete opposition to all forms of inequality, greed and injustice. Using a fairly simple home recording system, 'Confronting My Demons' came to light as the first piece of the the first EP entitled 'Let Us All Unite '. Subsequently, Alaa Abdullah, and Nour Sabbagh joined forces as permanent members. Alaa took over (Bass) duties, while Nour took over Vocals. Along with Mhd. Siam (Guitars), Raafat Atasi (Guitars),the band finalized the (EP) in late 2011, by adding four more tracks to the formula. Being inspired by anarchy, creative chaos and the false order that marked this planet, (Anarchadia) was coined, and chosen to be the band's name. The first single to be released will be entitled 'Occupy the Wall', strictly embodying an utter dedication to the people of the global Occupy movement..
