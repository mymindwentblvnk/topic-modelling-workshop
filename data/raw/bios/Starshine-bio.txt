There are two bands named Starshine, a rock one (1) and a funk one (2)

(1) Starshine is a dark rock band that seeks to combine the best elements of doom and black metal with disparate influences from post-punk, apocalyptic folk, industrial, krautrock, power electronics, contemporary classical, etc. into an organic process of evolution that follows the entire history of rock music. The natural emphasis is on originality, and so the goal is to never create two recordings that stay at the same point of expression. While keeping an essential flow that causes to come into being an atmosphere where we feel most comfortable and free, this music is not about following any scenes or movements. Starshine disbanded in 2006 and members went on to form the band Brown Jenkins. 



(2) Starshine is soul/funk band (stub) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Starshine">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
