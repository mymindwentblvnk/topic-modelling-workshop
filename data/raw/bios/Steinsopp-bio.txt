Norwegian psychedelic stoner-rock band Steinsopp have been writing psilocybin drenched rock'n'roll since the dawn of time. In 2015 they released a split with fellow Norwegian cultists Tempelheks. And finally in August 2016 a fungus infected monstrosity emerged from their deep in the woods-rehearsal studio, it was their first full length release (Steinsopp-S/T). Rumors tell us that the band consists of at least three bizarre beings, the first being the guitar playing woodland-dwarf Erik Alm, the second, the bass playing mushroom-man Steffen RÃ¸ed, and finally, the drummer Kim Hansen, who's origin is unknown. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Steinsopp">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
