VanJess is a R&B/Soul duo that have continued to lead the new age of artists cultivated through social media. 
With over 40 million video views on YouTube they have built a notable influence and used their talent to support causes like the "Louder than Words" campaign in 2012 and performing at 2013's "Lights Camera Cure" dance-a-thon. 
With appearances on shows like VH1's "The Linda Perry Project," the Nigerian American sisters have since re-released their debut EP "00 till Escape" which charted on iTunes top ten and trended worldwide. 
VanJess is currently working on their new EP due out Summer 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/VanJess">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
