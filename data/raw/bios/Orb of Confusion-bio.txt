Orb Of Confusion formed in 2006, when Clint and Leo (recently ex Hotblack Desiato) joined forced with Chris Corona from Floating Goat. Not much later, they found a bass player in Brooklyn native Laurie Safdie. Many shows were played around the west coast, two demos were released, and an album was recorded, but not released, before the band broke up in early 2009
