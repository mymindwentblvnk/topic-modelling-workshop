Brooklyn-based collective formed by Capital STEEZ featuring (and also co-founded by) artists such as Joey Bada$$, their music is highly influenced by 90's New York rap such as Organized Konfusion, the Wu-Tang Clan, Boot Camp Clik, A Tribe Called Quest, Nas, and others. Their music consist of lyrical songs mostly dealing with spirituality but also relationships and other subject matter. 2012 saw the group gain critical acclaim, with several individual mixtapes released and two as a group (The Secc$ Tape and PEEP The aPROcalypse). Rest In Peace to the late Capital STEEZ.
