Founded in Civita Castellana, Italy in 2008

IL GIARDINO ONIRICO (The Onirical Garden) are hailing from Civita Castellana, situated north of Rome. The band formed in September 2008 when keyboard player Emanuele 'Vastitas' Telli, guitarist Stefano Avigliana, Ettore Mazzarini (bass) and drummer Massimo Moscatelli combined their individual strength. The members' musical background is really wide and varied as each musician has preferences for different genres and experiences while playing in other bands.

This line up started to develop the first composition named 'Complesso K' which is a shifting suite filled with a variety of visions. In 2009 they were awarded as the winners of the Salefino Rock emerging band music contest. At the same time prog enthusiast Dario Hakim joined the band and inserted himself as the generator of sound effects and ambient textures.

After the release of 'Complesso K' IL GIARDINO ONIRICO started composing new material and Marco Marini, poet, painter and photographer joined the band contributing with his narrative voice. This completed line up then was ready to record the full length debut 'Perigeo', which saw the light of day in 2012, an ambitious heavy-edged progressive rock album which is suitable in order to reach for many fans worldwide. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/IL+GIARDINO+ONIRICO">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
