Cousteau is a London-based British band who enjoyed considerable success in Italy and the U.S. from 2001 to 2003. In 2005, with a revised line-up they released the album Nova Scotia which, due to legal reasons, was released in the U.S. in 2006 under the group name Moreau.

Their best known song remains the single "The Last Good Day of the Year", from their eponymous debut album.
