Bloody Heathen is a three-piece Deathstoner band from Helsinki, Finland. Trio began its journey in 2013 when A.I. Haverinen (vocals, guitar), Joni Rossi (drums) and Teemu Asumaa (bass) suddenly created a bunch of songs during the dark jamming rites. Music is influenced by old school death metal, doom, stoner etc. and also many non-metal genres. The atmosphere swells in the world of murderers, madness and Lovecraftian horror.
