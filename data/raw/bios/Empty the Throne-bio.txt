Empty the Throne are quickly becoming one of the frontrunners in a large Modern Death Metal scene.
Hailing from all over Melbourne, these five teens have now managed to forge a strong following in their first year together with an arsenal of punishing songs and an intense stage presence. Having recorded a demo on their own, the band has quickly established itself in the local scene.
2010 has been full of activity for Empty the Throne. In their short time as an active band, they have shared the stage with high caliber metal acts such as Silent Screams, The Red Shore, Resist the Thought, State of East London, and many others.
Expect a heavy dose of brutality from Empty the Throne in the months to come.
