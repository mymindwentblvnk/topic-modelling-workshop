Cor Scorpii is a new band formed by Windir keyboard player Gaute Refsnes. "Cor Scorpii" means "Heart of the scorpion". Cor Scorpii, a different designation for "Antares", is the brightest star in the constellation Scorpius.

After Ulcus and Windir joined forces, Refsnes continued making music with a somewhat different approach, resulting in plans of a project of his own. However it wasn't until the tragic death of Windir founder Terje "Valfar" Bakken and the following farewell concert, Cor Scorpii arose with a complete line-up. The original band lineup included Gaute Refsnes, Stian Bakketeig (lead guitar) and Jørn Holen (drums, currently also in Vreid), all of whom had been part of the renowned bands Windir and Ulcus, while Rune Sjøthun (rhythm guitar) and Inge Jonny Lomheim (bass) had been a part of the local metal scene for a long time. The line-up was completed by the hellish screams and presence of Thomas S. Øvstedal.

Jørn Holen later on quit the band in order to focus fully on Vreid. The current man behind the drums is Ole "Vargon" Nordsve. Erlend Nybø is the current lead guitarist (and also a member of Funeral).

Musically, Cor Scorpii incorporate different styles with emphasis on melodies and aggression. The music has some influences from both classical and folk music, combined with the atmospheres of Norwegian extreme metal. The lyrical concept deals with the darker sides of existence and the human mind.

The band released a demo called Attergangar in 2007. All four songs on the sold-out demo can now be downloaded for free from the official website.

Cor Scorpii released their debut album, Monument in 2008. Their second album, Ruin, was released in the summer of 2018 and received great reviews, making it to several top metal albums of 2018 lists. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cor+Scorpii">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
