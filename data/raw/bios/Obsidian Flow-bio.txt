Obsidian Flow was formed in September of 2008 in Tx, US. A demo entitled "Ancient Metropolis (Ruins)" was released that same month. After that, a few more demo tracks were written and recorded and the one man band relocated to Ca, US. A few attempts at forming a full band were made, but nothing has worked out as of present. Currently Obsidian Flow is writing more material for an upcoming demo/EP and getting a song set ready for possible live shows in the near future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Obsidian+Flow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
