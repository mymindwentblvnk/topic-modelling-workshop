Out of Milwaukee/Jackson, progressive rockers Wiszdomstone breathe fresh air into the half dead corpse that has become prog rock (in this scene) over the past decade. Dio, Maiden, Sabbath, and especially, Queensryche come to mind when listening to tracks that are meticulously produced in an obviously laborious studio setting. Music such as this transcends the song at hand by becoming a true art form. Calculated breaks, modulations and time changes create tracks that can be listened to over and over, where the listener can hear something new, or missed for the first few times around. For those who are truly into prog Wiszdomstone puts out what progressive fans yearn for with stellar musicianship and melody that keeps it interesting and accessible. No live shows posted yet, but with accolades from some of the top press in the industry, and the selling out of their first EP The Battle Rages, it would seem that popular demand will prevail.
