Eekkoo (pronounced "echo"), born Jonathan Doyon, is a music producer from Montreal, Canada. After introducing the world to the unparalleled talent of Skrillex and Feed Me, Deadmau5 has taken in a new protégé under his wing. Having spotted Eekkoo’s minimal Tech House track “Kung”, the iconic pot-stirrer that is Joel Zimmerman knew he had something special on his hands. Immediately signing him to Mau5trap, Eekkoo’s first release with the label is a forward-thinking remix of Wolfgang Gartner & Deadmau5’s Channel 42. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eekkoo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
