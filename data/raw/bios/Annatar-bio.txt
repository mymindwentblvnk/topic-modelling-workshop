With a convincing live performance and catchy songs, Annatar speaks to a broad audience. Next to hard metal there are also pop-inspired pieces which means: easy listening, yet interesting music. A good representation of what one could expect from Annatar can be heard on the just released "Reflection". On this EP the two great songs "Reflection" and "Out of my Hands" are found, which illustrate the beautiful mix of rough metal with dreamy melodies and catchy choruses.

Front-woman Liesbeth Cordia, whose beautiful vocals and catchy melodies lead Annatar, is accompanied by the solid guitar work of Bart Limburg and Johan van Heusden. The atmospheric sounds of keyboardist Wietse Braam make the music colorfull, and the inspirational rhythm section of drummer Daniel Zonneveld and Jeroen Gahrmann on the bass guitar completes it.

In recent years, the West-Dutch band shared the stage with several well-known bands, such as After Forever, Autumn, Epica, Imperia, Oceans of Sadness, ReVamp, Stream of Passion and Trail of Tears.

In Spring of 2011, Annatar disbanded and some members decided to start over as Eve's Fall, a pop-influenced metal band. Liesbeth Cordia is still the lead singer and their first full-length album will be released in the summer of 2012.
