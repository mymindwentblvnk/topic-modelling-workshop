Drawing comparisons with early Arctic Monkeys, Kings of Leon and Oasis, West Lothian quartet THE SNUTS have emerged as a word-of-mouth phenomenon throughout Scotland. In the process they've already passed a million streams at Spotify of their early demo recordings - all achieved organically without being promoted to radio, playlists or press.

THE SNUTS' combination of sheer energy, natural charisma and a growing catalogue of indie anthems has already been rewarded with a cult following. Their first headline show at the Glasgow institution King Tut's sold-out in a matter of hours, and was soon followed by subsequent sold-out dates in Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee and Manchester.

With such homeland backing to their name, THE SNUTS are now looking to take their ragged rock 'n' roll manifesto to a wider audience. That process starts with the release of their first full single 'Seasons'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Snuts">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
