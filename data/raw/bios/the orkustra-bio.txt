Orkustra was a band that tried a synthesis between symphonic orchestra and psychedelic band. The result was a sort of freeform psychedelia. The band existed a little more than a year before splitting in the summer of 1967. One of the main players was Bobby Beausoleil who later worked with Kenneth Anger and played the main role in the film Lucifer Rising before becoming involved with Charles Manson and his gang. Another player was David LaFlamme who later founded It's a Beautiful Day. During their heyday the band released no recordings, but RD Records of Switzerland has now released an LP with Orkustra music in collaboration with Beausoleil. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Orkustra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
