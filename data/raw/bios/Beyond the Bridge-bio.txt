After their formation in 2009, today, the band Beyond the Bridge consists of seven professional musicians, who wholeheartedly stand behind their exceptional and sophisticated music. Withal, the virtuosic mastery of their instruments is never the aim but the origin of their journey on which they always entrain their listeners. For Beyond the Bridge, the contents of their music, the story of every song, the compositions and arrangements, are always a part of something bigger - a total work of art shining over the borders of different genres and daring to defy conventions. A high ambition which they succeed to embrace on their d√©but album 'The Old Man and the Spirit'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beyond+the+Bridge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
