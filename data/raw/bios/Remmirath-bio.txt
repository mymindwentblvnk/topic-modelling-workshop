Emerging from black metal origins, Remmirath has progressed during its existence into an experimental entity that is difficult to be pigeonholed both musically and ideologically. After the demo Smrť Pútnikova released in 2005 and debut album Polis Rouge from 2008 (Ravenheart Productions), the second full-lenght Shambhala Vril Saucers (Todestrieb Recs/Kristallblut Records)  brings the music outside of usual genre mantinels and offers a psychedelic take on metal with influences from several other styles.
