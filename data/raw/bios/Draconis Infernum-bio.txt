DRACONIS INFERNUM is a Singaporean black metal band that was formed in 2005 and released it's debut full-length album Death In My Veins in 2008. The first notes of blasphemy was conceived and disseminated with the debut album Death in My Veins which was self-released in April 2008, limited to 500 copies. With the release of Death in My Veins, DRACONIS INFERNUM started spreading their plague with live rituals both locally and internationally.

DRACONIS INFERNUM has had the honour of sharing the stage with Japanese death metal titans DEFILED and HYDROPHOBIA on their Asian tour in 2008. In August 2009, DRACONIS INFERNUM made its first European appearance at Barther Metal Open Air Festival in Germany becoming the third South East Asian band at that point to ever set foot on European shores sharing the stage with some notable bands such as, KOLDBRANN, URGEHAL, DAKRNENED NOCTURN SLAUGHTERCULT, DORNENREICH and many others.

The blasphemous onslaught continued with DRACONIS INFERNUM supporting Swedish black metallers MARDUK in December 2010 on their Asian Black Death Redemption Tour performing 2 ritualistic dates in Indonesia. January 2011 also saw the band supporting IMPIETY on the first date of the Asian Worshippers Tour after 6 years of not playing on their home ground.

In June 2011, DRACONIS INFERNUM unleashed yet another round of darkness and chaos upon mankind with their second full length album entitled Rites of Desecration & Demise which was released via Hass Weg Productions (France), which contained 9 tracks of unrelenting Satanic black metal, including a bonus track of BATHORY’s Satan My Master which featured KULT OV AZAZEL’s Xaphan providing guest vocals and a guitar solo.

The release of Rites of Desecration & Demise saw DRACONIS INFERNUM engaging in yet another round of touring and live rituals at various festivals in the region and more recently in November 2012, supporting DARK FUNERAL on their Satanic War tour in Australia.
