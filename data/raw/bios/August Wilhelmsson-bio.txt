When I think about it, I have been into film music since i was very young. I simply love that kind of music, the way it supports, enchants and amplify what is on the screen. I like to be able to guide the audience with emotions. 

I work in my own studio in Gothenburg Sweden, a bit lonely sometimes but I guess there isn't really any other way to do it. To get some perspective on my work I use to take long walks - whatever the weather or time of day.
