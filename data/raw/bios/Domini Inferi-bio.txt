There are two bands named Domini Inferi:

1) Domini Inferi was raised, November 2001, by Hellchrist Xul (Funeral Winds, Haatstrijd, Inferi), inspired by bands as Beherit, Von and early Bathory, creating raw and primitive music and ritualistic soundscapes to praise Satan, to hail perversion, to blaspheme the holy trinity and its pathetic followers…

In January 2002 the first demo was released by Pisspleased Records from the Netherlands called “In Nomine Domini Inferi” which was recorded during November/December of 2001.

In December 2003 the split ep with botulistum was released by new era productions from the Netherlands. 4 tracks of utter blasphemy featuring a full colour ep cover with a photograph of a statue of christ, his face covered with shit… “Acts of excrement terrorism on the holy trinity” was a fact…

In 2004 Satanic Propaganda Records from Sweden re-released the “In Nomine Domini Inferi” demo on tape format with an extra bonus track. The same label shall release the upcoming “Devil Cult” album on cassette. The CD version will be unleashed by Sadolust Records from the Netherlands. Both formats will be available from of November 2006.
Beware…

In Nomine Domini Inferi…

Hail Satan!

2) Domini Inferi was a Canadian short-lived project led by Ryan Förster (Conqueror, Blasphemy) on guitars and Sven Cannon (War Command) on drums and vocals. They've only recorded one song called 'Awaken (Beast Most Foul)', which was first released in a 1994 demo and later re-released on a 2006 split with Warhate. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Domini+Inferi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
