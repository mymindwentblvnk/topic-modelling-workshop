The music and lyrics of Jazzvocals are a reflection of my star sign, Gemini - on the one hand, there's "me", Jasmin, who spends her everyday existence trying to succeed in everything, whether work or study. On the other hand, there is my darker side, reflected in my vocals, a side where I am able to let go and be free'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jazzvocals">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
