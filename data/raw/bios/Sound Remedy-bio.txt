"The kid without a face absolutely kicked our big asses in ‘09. After dropping 2 hard bass line bangers with a lot of tuff love inside, Sound Remedy convinced any single part of our bodies with the one & only hymn of the year: Field, plus an overwhelming video-clip. This is why he deserves to be titled as

"TFLs impact of the big 9"

We’re very looking forward to his first EP, that should be dropped in January ‘10, smashing our guts to pulp with serious, dark and haunted electro-techno-tracks. As long as the Ep will not date the streets and to support Sound Remedy constantly we give away a more ‘fun’ tune for you to enjoy - and of course his #1 in 2K9."
