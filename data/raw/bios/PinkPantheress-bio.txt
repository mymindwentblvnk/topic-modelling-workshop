PinkPantheress is an English singer, songwriter and record producer.
She was born in Bath, England, to a Kenyan mother, who works as a carer, and an English father, who works as an academic and is based in the United States. In her early teens, she was the lead singer in a My Chemical Romance cover band, and performed with them for the first time at a school fÃªte. While attending secondary school in Kent, she started writing music to help a friend before eventually writing music on her own. At age 17, she began using GarageBand to produce instrumentals for her friend, fellow singer Mazz, and she later used GarageBand to record many of her early songs while lying down in her university hall late at night.

In January 2021, her single "Pain" gained attention on TikTok and peaked at number 35 on the UK Singles Chart. Her breakout single "Break It Off" also went viral on TikTok, and she was subsequently signed to Parlophone Records and Elektra Records. She released her song "Passion" in February 2021. After a snippet of her song "Just for Me" went viral, she released it in August 2021. It peaked at number 27 on the UK Singles Chart, making it her second top-40 and her highest entry on the chart.  A music video for the song was released in September 2021 and co-directed by PinkPantheress. In early October 2021, she announced the release date and title of her debut mixtape, To Hell with It. Her song "I Must Apologise" was also released in October 2021. To Hell with It was released on October 15, 2021 through Parlophone and Elektra Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/pinkpantheress">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
