Ukrainian black metal project formed by members of Ygg, Khors, and Nokturnal Mortum with heavy influence from 90s scandinavian black metal such as Immortal, Enslaved and so forth. As with Khors and Ygg, the music is very atmospheric, focusing on Pagan themes and the occult.

Despite the refusal of several musicians from Ygg, Ulvegr, and Khors to appear at the same stage with M8L8TH in 2012 (due to tension with one of the bandâ€™s past members), they continued to tour with other NS bands including the Russian ones. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ulvegr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
