There are/were at least two bands named Funereus.
1) A raw black metal band originally from Mexico, later relocated to US. Formed in 2008, so far they have released 2 full-lenght albums and a number of smaller releases. 

2) The US doom-death band that changed their name to Evoken. Funereus released only one demo and unlike Evoken have very raw, keyboardless, barbaric sound and deeper growls.Have close similarity to Rigor Sardonicous, Lord of Putrefaction, the earliest dISEMBOWELMENT demos and to slow parts of Incantation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Funereus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
