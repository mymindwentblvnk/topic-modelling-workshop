being a huge arnold schoenberg fan and a lover of dissonant music (although not so much metal) i was keen to check out a band claiming to incorporate his twelve tone theory into their music and brag about it. i have to say i was slightly let down that it seemed only used for certain ideas during the songs, the rest (of the songs) sound pretty much like any metal band around, you have to admire the technicality of the guitar work obviously, but as  arnold shoenberg's students did, it seemed watered down and moves around like its in a very distinct key which is fine, but for fans like me i would love for the true beauty of the twelve tones to shine through and not used as a way of showing technical ability on a fretboard. but you cant please everyone and the fact they are advertising a way of composition without the restraints of a key is always a good thing and keeps shoenbergs spirit alive!
