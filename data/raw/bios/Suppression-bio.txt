Existing in one form or another since 1992...after 14 years of genre-hopping, multiple line-up changes, releases on numerous labels, and public nudity...sadly they still exist. Recently "nick-naming" themselves THE FANTASTIC WONDERFULS, the 2 final members of the group are currently working on their "so called" crowning achievement...with song titles such as: Well Hung Toddler, Cowboys From Yale, Beautiful Frogs In An Ugly Jungle, Seeping Breath, and I Was Born On Leap Year, they hope to break into mainstream radio and seal the deal with a HUGE record corporation. Until then CNP Records will assume the dubious task of releasing this crowning achievement until a licensing deal will strip the profits from the labels' hands and into the pockets of the big wigs and those 2 douchebags, Jason and Ryan. The band is a glorified side-project of Ryan Parrish, who is usually playing drums for  DARKEST HOUR  , and Jason Hodges, who is usually singing and playing with  THE AMOEBA MEN.  The current line-up of Suppression has released 2 seven inches on  CNP Records  and a CD on  UndeRadar  , with a couple of compilation appearances on CNP, as well as a video for their song "Release The Piranha" on the CNP DVD. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Suppression">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
