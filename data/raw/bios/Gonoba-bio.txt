It all started in autumn 2004 in Domzale in the local youth center (MKC Akumulator) when the drummer and both of the guitar players met. At first they were playing cover songs from metal legends like Iron Maiden, Metallica, Judas Priest, ... Soon after that they got a singer (Ziga Panjan) and a bass player (Marko Hrzenjak) and so the 5 member group chose a name "Gonoba" (old Slovene word for doom and destruction). This line-up lasted for about two and a half years and they had several concerts but they still played mostly cover songs. Later on the vocalist and the bassist left the band. They formed a new line-up which took a while as they were still defining their metal style. After a few more failed tries they met Brane (Bass) who brought something fresh into their style of music because he had more experience from playing in his last band Crossbreed from Rogaska Slatina. They decided for Thrash/Death Metal style and soon started creating their own music. A few months later Hopsy (Vocals) joined the band and so Gonoba got a new meaning. In the beginning of the year 2006 a whole new chapter for the band was opened. Now they have a full line-up and are ready for more concerts in the future.
