Hollow Mirror started somewhere in the late fall of 2009 making a few home demos and playing shows in Moscow clubs. The band continued to evolve through 2010 improving musical technique and live performances and developing its own unique style, which along with a girl on the rhythm guitar makes Hollow Mirror one of the most noticeable bands on the Moscow stage. 
Since their formation the band has experienced few
line-up changes and moved from heavy- and power-metal influenced music
to an original and more extreme mixture of modern metal genres. 
In October 2011 the band debuted with power metal EP Approaching Visions.
In March 12, 2012 the first thrash/death metal song Lost was released as Internet Single.
The band's second studio release, Internet-single Crimson Eye, that released in September 12, 2012 stands as the milestone of this transition. While publishing studio works band had an active concert schedule. The most significant live performances took place at an international metal festival in Belarus, and as a supporting band for Heaven Shall Burn and Caliban. At some point the guys decided to record a full-length album which was called for its opening song “Corrupt Constitution” and released worldwide on 14 of April, 2016.
For now Hollow Mirror is mostly studio project, preparing material for their further releases. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hollow+Mirror">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
