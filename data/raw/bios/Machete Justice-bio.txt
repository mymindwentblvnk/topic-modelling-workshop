Machete Justice is a band that wants to take their brand of metal to the world. Coming from the small but underestimated country of New Zealand, it can be a hard road for metal bands but Machete Justice love a challenge. Their music takes inspiration from the heavy metal and hard rock bands of the 90's and blends those influences with a fresh approach to songwriting that has been sorely lacking from the genre for too long. Since forming a year ago, they have recorded and released their debut album "REVERSION" and lined up gigs with the heavyweights of NZ metal with a view to take their music over the seas in 2012.
