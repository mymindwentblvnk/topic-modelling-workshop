Krew (polish: Blood [pronounced "kræf"]) is a Black Metal Band from Fulda.

Started as a solo-project by Nimrod in 2008, he decided to found an entire band after getting some positive feedback at his first songs. For this purpose he asked Nihilæus to join him as vocalist in November 2009. Shortly after Taranis and Mort entered the band as bassist and second guitarist. The search for a capable drummer took a while, but with Wulfing they found the right man for that job in July 2010. The band was complete.

A demo CD was released in November 2010.
