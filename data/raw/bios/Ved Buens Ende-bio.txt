Ved Buens Ende is a metal band from Oslo, Norway, formed in 1994 by the drummer Carl-Michael Eide and guitarist Vicotnik, who were then joined by bassist Skoll. The band was unique by their mixture of many unusual musical elements for metal, such as atonality and dissonance, a very prominent bass sound as well as Eide's crooning and Vicotnik's characteristic shrieks.

The band split up in 1997, after releasing only one full-length album, Written in Waters, with the British label Misanthropy Records. Ved Buens Ende rehearsed for a new album in 2006 (never released), but split up again in 2007, because, as stated in their Myspace, Vikotnic and Czral realized they had grown apart musically. Much of the material intended for this release ultimately appeared on Virus' The Black Flux.

Carl-Michael Eide also founded Virus in 2000. This band is considered a continuation of his previous work with Buens Ende because of similar musical elements and an avant-garde form of unusual experimentation, although the band has its own characteristic sound.

The band reunited a second time in 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ved+Buens+Ende">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
