Mexicans With Guns is the raw and exciting production-moniker/character created by Exponential Records honcho Ernest Gonzales. After prepping his Been Meaning to Tell You LP for the Friends of Friends label, EG was in search of a new sound and ready to explore the depths of bass music and it’s unique sonic elements…his journey lead him to the cutty edges of his mind where Mexico, London and the Dirty South all fused into one mysterious and club friendly mindset.

Dawning the mexican wrestling mask in February 2009, MwG began tearing down the streets with big bass and a nasty swag, breaking out remixes for the likes of Bassnectar, Rainbow Arabia, Cyne, Faunts, Yppah, and shared the stage with the likes of Peanut Butter Wolf, Daedelus, Ghosts on Tape, Nocando, Eliot Lipp, Mux Mool, Jogger and more. The Me Gusto EP is just a taste of what’s to come from MwG in the near future including collaborations with Tiffany Preston (Rainbow Arabia), Nocando (Alpha Pup) and more, so watch out!
