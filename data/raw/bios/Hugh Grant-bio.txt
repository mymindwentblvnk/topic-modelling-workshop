Hugh John Mungo Grant (born September 9, 1960 in London, England) is an English actor and film producer. 

In 2007, Grant starred opposite Drew Barrymore in a parody of pop culture and the music industry called Music and Lyrics. Though he neither listens to music nor owns any CDs, Grant learned to sing, play the piano, dance and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare for his role as a has-been pop singer, based loosely on Andrew Ridgeley. The movie, with its revenues totalling $145 million, allowed Grant to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washed-up lead character. The soundtrack album reached #5 on the Billboard Top Soundtracks Chart and #63 on the Billboard 200 in the United States. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hugh+Grant">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
