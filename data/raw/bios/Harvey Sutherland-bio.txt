A one-time session player and behind-the-scenes man, analog synthesist Harvey Sutherland emerged from Melbourne’s bubbling underground with a cassette tape in hand. 2013’s Nexus EP on This Thing Records – a trip through lo-fi boogie and Roland house music – was a cult hit amongst dance floor aficionados and primed listeners for his latest 12″s on Echovolt and Voyage Recordings. His music has been played and appreciated worldwide, with support from prominent tastemakers Bradley Zero, Tom Noble and Motor City Drum Ensemble. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Harvey+Sutherland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
