Blessed with early success, Vancouver's Crop Circle had a surprise runaway hit with Mexican Cockfight…before setting foot on a stage. From there the band hit the road touring western Canada several times from Victoria to Winnipeg. Some of the highlights included performing with ZZ Top at The Bluff in Kelowna, playing Calgary Stampede with Bif Naked, 2 consecutive years on Budweiser’s True Music tour and 3 trips to Edmonton within a 3-week period. In that time Crop Circle produced 2 demo EPs and sold over 1,000 copies right off the stage. The band used those hard miles and experience on the road to write songs and develop their sound. Crop Circle then entered the studio with producer Todd Kerns to record their debut album “Come Inside.” The band wanted to cut it old school so the complete record was recorded and mixed to tape in just 2 weeks. The CD was released in April of ‘08.

Crop Circle is comprised of a bunch of guys who grew up together in Mission, a small mill town outside of Vancouver. They all played in their first bands together in high school, so their roots run deep. In fact, the band still rehearses in an old barn out in the Valley. Crop Circle is all about friends uncompromisingly playing the music they love and having a great time doing it! Sean McCormick (vocals), Brian Garbet (guitar), Nathan Zadworny (bass) & Ben Darbey (drums). 

“The secret is out - a long sought after mystery has been revealed. The answers to the world’s crop circle phenomenon lie here on Canada’s west coast!” Shannon Ambrose – The TUB Mag
