Primal Creation consists of five persistent men playing metal the way they see fit. The band found its current stable line-up in 2014 and self-released their debut full-length album Demockracy three years on, in 2017.Their modern thrash metal brought them supportslots for D.R.I. and Skeletonwitch as well as a spot at Wacken Open Air 2019. Early 2020 – the forsaken pandemic year – the band released a digital only single Vial Play. This new track displayed a step up towards a more progressive and twisted sound, while retaining their thrash metal roots. A keen eye for hooks, melody and authentic angry vocals complete the sound of Primal Creation. 

Come 2021, Primal Creation proudly presents their sophomore record News Feed. 1 intro and 8 tracks display the evolution the band has gone through. News Feed was recorded and mixed throughout 2020 by Francis Snebbout at Oakwood Recording Studio, Kaprijke (BE) and mastered by Alan Douches at West West Side Music, NY (USA). The album will be released on 16-04-2021 and will be available on both CD and vinyl (limited to 100 pieces). March 5th will see the release of the first single and on April 9th another song will be up for streaming. Pre-orders start on February 26th through Bigcartel and Bandcamp.
