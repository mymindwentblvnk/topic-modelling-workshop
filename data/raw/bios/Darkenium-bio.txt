Fuelled with the desire to create fast unrelenting Death Metal, vocalist Richard Clements and Guitarist Grant Burns shed skin with former band Vespers Descent to create a modern metal band whilst containing the old school death aura. Darkeniumâ€™s fast tempos, shredding riffs and brutal drum work will surely be a treat for fans of new and old school Death Metal.
