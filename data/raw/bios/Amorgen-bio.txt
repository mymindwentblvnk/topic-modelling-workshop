Amorgen is an epic folkmetal band from South Holland. The music can be described as a mix of epic folk and death metal.

Known bands Amorgen derives some of its style from include Wintersun, Ensiferum and Equilibrium, but there are also some influences from the (old school) death metal.

The band arose from the remains of a previous band from which one of the guitarists was replaced by Michel Trijsburg.
The band started out under the name of Amorgen, the last known bard from the Irish folklore. Amorgen writes their lyrics from his perspective, as a report of epic tales from a selfmade fantasyworld.

The songs on our EP are linked to tales of that world. Sharpen Thy Axes for example is about the preperations for a war of a suppressed people who want revenge. Under Siege is the sequel to that; the war seen from the perspective of another nation.
