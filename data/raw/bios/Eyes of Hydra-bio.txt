The group was founded in October 2003 under the name of "Breathing Hate" by Marco (guitar), Matteo (keyboard) and Daniele(drums). After few months Tommy (bass) and Denis (voice) joined the band. Together with them the first songs were written: a typical "power" sound was melted with a "death" voice, as a result of the several musical influences of all the members. In February 2004, with the definite composition, the group decided to change its name into "Eyes of Hydra".

In May 2004 they recorded their first demo-cd, "Behind the gates of agony". In the following months it resulted in being quite successful and gathered positive reviews in several websites. In October 2004, after the first live performance at "Transilvania" in Turin, some inner disagreements took place which led to the leave of the drummer, Daniele. Everybody felt the disappointed, because Daniele was one of the first founders of the band.

Its place was taken by the "energetic" Gianni. With him the group performed some soncerts in Piedmont and Lombardy, confirming its success and having the pleasure of sharing the stage with artists like Extrema, Lifend and Madwork. In June 2006 Daniele replaces Denis at vocals. At the moment the band is busy with the pre-production of the first full-lenght album. The new album will be a 50 minutes black metal concept including special progressive melodic sounds mixed with powerful and aggressive guitar riffs and symphonic elements. Three songs will be included in a promo-cd, that will produced, mixed and mastered by 5k0tt Mazend, guitarist and producer of the industrial space metal band T3CHN0PH0B1A. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eyes+of+Hydra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
