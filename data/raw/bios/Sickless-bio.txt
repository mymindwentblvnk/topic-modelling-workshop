Sickless was born in 1989...
Fascinated and inspired by acts like Blumentopf, Creutzfeld & Jakob, Dynamite Deluxe or M.O.R, Sickless decided to write his own raps.

First Connections with DreisterKerl and the first Track with him was produced.

Sickless met his Producer S.E.M.I By Internet.
Now they are working to get enough stuff for a Promo EP
