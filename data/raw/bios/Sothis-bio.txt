SOTHIS was formed by drummer Dross and guitarist Scathe in 1999. After a long and tedious search for qualified, like-minded musicians the two were able to solidify a complete line-up and the band released a self-titled EP through independent channels in early 2005. SOTHIS released a limited edition DVD entitled “Official Bootleg” in late 2005 and then embarked on a South-West mini tour in the Summer of 2006. In 2007 SOTHIS again released another limited edition DVD entitled “Live in Mexico” as well as a video for the song “Sinister Nation” as they completed work on their debut album. In January of 2008 members of SOTHIS flew to Vargberg, Sweden to mix their debut album “De Oppresso Liber” with Andy LaRocque of KING DIAMOND fame at his Sonic Train Studios. The band returned to the United States with the new album and secured a worldwide record deal with Candlelight Records who released “De Oppresso Liber” in September of 2008. SOTHIS then embarked on a West coast mini tour in late 2008 followed by a proper North American tour in the Summer of 2009. SOTHIS released a video “De Oppresso Liber” for their debut with Candlelight Records in the Summer of 2009 and began working on a second video for the opening track “Of Night and Silence” which was release in Fall of 2009. SOTHIS is currently in finalizing the writing for their sophomore release and are scheduled to enter the studio in the Summer of 2011 for a early 2012 release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sothis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
