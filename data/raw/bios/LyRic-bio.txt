18-year-old Gold Coast singer/songwriter and producer, Lyric, entrances audiences with her relatable lyricism and innovative production quality. Crafting songs from the comfort of her home studio, as well as busking them on the streets of Surfers Paradise, Lyric demands attention for her expressive voice and innate gift for storytelling. Her latest single, '1985', is a nod to the 80s, and a story of electrifying, forbidden love. Featuring swirling synths and strings - and heavily inspired by the likes of Taylor Swift and Conan Gray - the track encapsulates the feeling of surrendering to your deepest desires, regardless of what you know the outcome will be. Perfectly bending the genres between pop, indie and singer/songwriter, her catalogue makes for an exceptionally diverse and exciting listening experience. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lyric">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
