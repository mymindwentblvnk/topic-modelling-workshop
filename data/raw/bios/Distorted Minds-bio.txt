Distorted Minds is a Bristol based collaboration between Alistair Vickery & Jon Midwinter. 
Alistair Vickery first started out a DJ in and around Bristol and London. He then progressed to buying his own studio in the latter part of 97, because to be a DJ wasn't enough.
Jon Midwinter first started as a DJ  on one of Bristol's pirate radio stations. He began writing and producing back in 1996, developing his own styles before teaming up with Alistair Vickery at the end of 1997, creating Distorted Minds.
