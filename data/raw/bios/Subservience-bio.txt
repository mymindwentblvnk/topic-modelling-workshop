Taking their cues from bands such as Gojira, Entombed, Bolt Thrower, Strapping Young Lad and Carcass, Subservience spit forth a corrosive blend of unrelenting extremity.

“Bear witness to the signs of the last days of your life, where the seeds of terror are planted in the garden of your nightmares.”

Drawing influence from the classic British death metal bands of yesteryear as well as the recent
breed of modern greats, brutal Brighton quintet Subservience are destroying listeners across the country with their corrosive blend of extreme metal. You will find no self-indulgent displays here; Subservience get in your face and assault you until your necks snap and your retinas begin to warp.

Their live show is an all-out attack on the senses, and has earned their reputation as the “heaviest band in Brighton”; a reputation which has secured them slots alongside the likes of Xerath, Abgott, Mortad and Romeo Must Die, as well as a huge hometown show at The Haunt, and even a slot at Hammerfest III.

Subservience are due to go from strength to strength with the release of their latest EP Dystopia; a dark collection of the five most antisocial tracks the band has written to date, brimming over with concentrated fury and a taste for the misanthropic.
