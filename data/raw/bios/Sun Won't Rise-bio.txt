Sun Won't Rise is a one-man Black Metal band from Montréal, Canada managed by Michelle Massacre.
They have three albums released:

-Songs in the Key of Genocide
-Ballads to Beckon the End...
and
-Hang in there Baby!

(all of which were released this year (2012) all within a few weeks of each other). Musically, the style of Black Metal showcased on each album shifts with each release. "Songs in the Key of Genocide" is performed in a Blackened Crust/Powerviolence style, whereas "Ballads to Beckon the End..." is pure intense depression set to music. The third, and final release so far, "Hang in there Baby!" has more in common with Post-Black Metal. 

Michelle was born in Newport, VT, but was raised in the Southern U.S. before relocating to Québec where he now resides.
His influences include: Glen Danzig, Type O Negative, Dissection, Abyssic Hate, and Burzum.
