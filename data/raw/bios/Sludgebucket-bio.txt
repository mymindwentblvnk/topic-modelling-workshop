Sludgebucket is a stoner metal band from Oakland,CA started in 2005 out of Soundwave Studios.Mixing blisteringly heavy riffs (Black Sabbath and Blue Cheer) with odd meter and sludgy groove(Sleep,King Crimson) with bluesy guitar leads and raspy aggressive vocals(Black Flag,Motorhead). 

Started by Kelly Waldrip(Fuzzplow,Space Grass) on bass/vocals, with John R. Santos(Fuzzplow,Braindozer,Space Grass) on guitars, and Doug Weldy(Greenhouse Effect,Six Liter, Infamous Choke Chain) on drums.They recorded at John's Hedonistic Studios in Oakland an ep and their full length s/t cd in 2005-2006, and released it in 2007.They hit the live circuit in the east bay for the next few years undergoing some lineup changes on drums(Max Adams(Maxwell Adams), Thomas Perry(Flametal,Lost Ticket) along the way.

Sadly in march of 2009, John Robert Santos passed away, leaving the band on hiatus til october 2009, when they added Jordan Watts on guitar.Thomas Perry moved on due to other obligations and was replaced by original drummer, Douglas Weldy on drums, thus completing the lineup.Back in the studio and live circuit in february of 2010 they are getting ready to release another cd and continue to tear it up in the east bay scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sludgebucket">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
