These guys are from lisbon, Portugal. This project rises from the "envie" of (re)produce the skeleton of their rock fragmented bodies, an expulsion of years and years listening to freak, free, teared apart-rock. And rip it off their bodies. Not by chance Caveira means "skull" in portuguese. Mind-progressive experimentation. For the sake of themselves.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Caveira">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
