The eclectic and versatile guitarist John Cobbett (Gwar, Ludicra, Slough Feg, Amber Asylum, Jarboe) from San Francisco gave birth in 2000 to Hammers of Misfortune, previously known as Unholy Cadaver.

Later in 2001, the band released their first full length album “The Bastard” (an epic tale told in three acts with three distinct characters/voices) on Tumult Records. Critically acclaimed, the album was voted among the top 40 releases of 2001 by the writers of Terrorizer magazine.  Lamentations of the Flame Princess magazine declared 2001 to be "the Year of the Hammers" and named "The Bastard" Best Album, Best Concept Album and Best Overall Packaging.

In 2003, the band signed a deal with CRUZ DEL SUR MUSICCruz, releasing their second opus “The August Engine” by the end of the same year.

The response was again awesome. “The August Engine” was voted by BW&BK writer Chris Bruni as the best album of 2003, and received a 10/10 rating on the same magazine (“Entirely something new, and entirely something creatively masterful. 10/10” Martin Popoff, BW&BK).

Many other media voices praised the album:

    * “Unmatched in 2003, The August Engine is easily one of the best records this year and one that has to be heard to truly believe just what talent they really do possess. 9/10” Adrian Bromley, Unrestrained Mag
    * “If you don’t like Hammers of Misfortune, you just don’t like Metal.” John Gnesin, digitalmetal.com
    * “I definitely recommend this album to anyone who enjoys metal, this is a must have”. Josh Wagers,1340mag.com
    * “They are here to save the world from mediocrity. 10/10” JayKeeley, RoyalCarnage.com

In 2005, HAMMERS OF MISFORTUNE began the recordings of their third album “The Locust Years,” under the supervision of Justin Weis at Trackworx Studios, which was finally released, again via CRUZ DEL SUR MUSIC, in June 2006 (US) and September 2006 (Europe). — Cruz Del Sur Music <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hammers+of+Misfortune">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
