The Wealthy West is American musician Brandon Kinder, previously the enigmatic singer for The Rocketboys.

Kinder, of Austin, TX, has set himself apart as a powerful songwriter with a unique voice and a knack for telling stories through song. Through the success and loyal following that The Rocketboys built over the years, Kinder has captivated audiences through four acclaimed albums and prominent TV and film placements. In his spare time, Kinder began writing songs that wouldn’t necessarily fit for The Rocketboys, and without a true outlet for them, The Wealthy West was born.

The Wealthy West trades The Rocketboys’ anthemic indie rock for a serious dose of Americana coupled with Kinder’s signature eccentricity weaved into tales of bad choices, long roads, longing for home and the banality of love. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Wealthy+West">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
