Joshua Worden is a solo artist and producer based in Atlanta, GA, whose music is an original blend of R&B, jazz, and indie pop with electronic production. The mood is downtempo; the "slow burn". Inspired by artists such as Frank Ocean, Raphael Saadiq and James Blake, his music and lyrics, though accessible, veer heavily towards introspective and atypical territory. Joshua is a trained musician (in jazz guitar) and, as a multi-instrumentalist and singer/songwriter, he writes, arranges and produces all of his own material.

Says Joshua: "I love music and genuinely believe that it is my path. I feel that music, more than any other pursuit, is the way that I can give back to the world."

Joshua released his debut EP, "The Withered Tree" in July of 2012. He will be releasing his first full-length album, the daring and vulnerable "Always This", in June 2013. Worden's live band consists of himself (vocals, keys, guitar, synth, samples) and Will Montgomery (drums, vocals, samples). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joshua+Worden">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
