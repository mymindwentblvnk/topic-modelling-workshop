Jack Glass are no more, sadly our vocalist moved to England and we felt without our valued friend it would not be the same. If any bands are looking for a bass guitarist even for a temp project, then drop Mark a line.

Thanks

Jack Glass is a 4 piece rock/metal band from Scotland. We play all our own material and want to show everyone that British rock is alive and well. The band has been influenced by the likes of Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Down, C.O.C, Clutch & Chrome Locust to name a few, but weâ€™ve stamped our own unique style & sound throughout our music. We can also be found on MYSPACE via our official website.
