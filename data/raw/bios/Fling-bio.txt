Fling, described as "combining the folktronica of The Beta Band, the psychedelic grooves of ‘Screamadelica’ era Primal Scream and the visceral turn of phrase of The Fat White Family", are a Bradford-located band playing an experimental mixture of rock, indie, pop and a handful of other genres.

The band consists of Charles McSorley (lead vocals), Jack Winn (guitar, vocals), Jake Lees (bass, vocals), Billy Fielding (drums, backing vocals), and Sam Malynowsky (keyboards), all good friends for years. Asked about their inspirations, Fling's frontman McSorley answers "I think we all share the love of the classics, pretty much any Beatles, The Clash, David Bowie, The Sex Pistols, The Kinks, Oasis and other such artists’ albums constantly inspire us and will do forever I think. Just all the good stuff basically."

So far, Fling are something of a British pearl sprawling onto the musical scene, with continuous local gigs around Bradford, festival appearances and 6 (as of March 4th, 2018) singles available via streaming devices. Their latest track, "Banjo Billy", debuted worldwide on March 2nd, 2018.
