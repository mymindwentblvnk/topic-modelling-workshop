The union of Acrimonious exalts the four hundred ninety six thousand yellow eyes of Levyatan through mantras and mandalas, executed through guitar, drum and oracular voice.

"Musick! Lift up my Sacrifice!"
Thus sang the Lapis Flute for Djann,
"And at my Word, let fall the Blade
Upon the ripen'd field of Man.
Let Old Adam bend beneath the Scythe
And grant the New his bloody tithe."
Thus sang the Voice of Azrvan!
(By Andrew Chumbley)
