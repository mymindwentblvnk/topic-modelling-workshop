Bumsnogger started out in 2002 in Nottingham, England. They were heavily influenced by bands such as Iron Monkey and Eyehategod with other more traditional influences thrown in such as Black Sabbath and Motorhead. 

They released a debut Ep in June 2003 '...And Destroy All That Come Before Us' on Ape of Thoth Records which was the band's own label, despite the band having one of the worst names possible, it was this ep that gained the band most of it's fanbase, containing the band's most popular song "Dutch Fisting".

The band's next release was a 7" split with close friends Among The Missing in July 2005 (on Calculon Records & Withered Hand Records). 'Bum The Missing' contained one track from 'snogger "Trampling The Infidels Under Hooves Of Hot Iron" and was limited to 333 copies on pink vinyl. A tour of their homeland complemented this release.

In 2006 the band released another EP consisting of 6 tracks, titled 'Alcohol and Swine', released on Calculon Records this was to be the band's final release as they announced they were to split shortly afterwards. The 6 piece played their final gig in their hometown of Nottingham on 23rd December 2006 at Rock City.
