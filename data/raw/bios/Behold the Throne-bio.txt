“Merchants” marks the debut album from a new face in the local scene – BEHOLD THE THRONE. A screaming rasp punishes alongside soaring vocals, both over riffs that demonstrate a hunger for more than the common breakdown. With all members at the age of sixteen, “Merchants” marks the beginning of something that holds no limits; BEHOLD THE THRONE is writing for a full length and preparing for the future. Support and buy the debut EP, shirts and other merch online or at a show.

BEHOLD THE THRONE has played with bands like A Day to Remember, Burden of a Day, Before Their Eyes, Before We Forget, Through the Fire and many more.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Behold+The+Throne">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
