It’s no coincidence that when the now 19 year-old Oski dropped his first track just a year ago, Australia’s east coast was forecast to be hit by an earthquake—this bass-lover’s tracks caused waves not just around the country, but internationally too. Debuting after a tedious four years of perfecting his style, the tender youngster exploded quickly, fast becoming a favourite across Soundcloud, YouTube and the blogosphere. His bass-driven take on trap set the internet buzzing, seeing features on the likes of Real Trap, This is For You, AllThingsTrap, ShutYourTrap, Trap and Bass and many more. It was his single Heatwave that caused the most stir, clocking over 150,000 plays across the web. Oski’s debut EP Rise further showcased his unique take on bass, borrowing influences from minimalism, dubstep and even Arabic sounds to channel into trap beats. His collaboration with Rattraps, Nice N Slo, further expanded Oski’s musical palette, showing versatility into the likes of dancefloor-ready Jersey Club tracks. Sporting a mischievous presence and a magnetic set, Oski is a fast-riser, having already gained recognition from the likes of Hydraulix, Doctor Werewolf, Ego, Spenda C, DJ Butcher, PhaseOne and many more for his music. Put this one on the ones-to-watch-in-2014 list, and get ready to dance ‘til your feet bleed. And then dance some more.
