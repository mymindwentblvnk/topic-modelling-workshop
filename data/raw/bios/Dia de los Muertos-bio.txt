Dia De Los Muertos is a metal band, formed in Los Angeles, California in 2005. Founded by Andres Jaramillo and Alfonso Pinzon of Agony, and Vincent Price of Body Count, as a side project. Since they couldn't find an official singer for the band, they asked a few friends to write lyrics and record vocals over their music. That's how the band created a 'brotherhood' around their music and the bilingual Latino concept of the band's name, meaning and background. Their first release Day Of The Dead EP was recorded at Dungeon Studios in Los Angeles, mixed by Roy Z and released on Cinismo records in 2005, featuring vocals by Tony Campos (Static X, Asesino, Ministry, Prong - also known as Maldito X), Andres Gimenez (A.N.I.M.A.L.), Loana dP Valencia (Dreams Of Damnation), Alex Oquendo (Masacre), Alfonso Pinzon and Vincent Price. Dia De Los Muertos performed at the world's largest 'free of charge' rock festival Rock Al Parque in 2006 with Fear Factory and Death By Stereo.

The lastest album "Satanico-Dramatico" was released electronically for free on 3/23/2011, featuring Adrian Villanueva (Engrave) on guitar, Alejandro Corredor (Sin Salida, El Sagrado) on Bass, once again mixed by Roy Z, guests vocals by Jeff Walker (Carcass), Maldito X (Asesino), Scott Carlson (Repulsion), Anton Reisenegger (Criminal), Andres Gimenez (AN.I.M.A.L.), Boris Bonillo and a special appearance of Jonny Coffin (The Death Riders) on guitar in the instrumental title-track. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dia+De+Los+Muertos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
