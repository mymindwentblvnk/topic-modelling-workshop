Scene Creamers, is an eclectic indie rock band based out of Washington, D.C.

After being threatened with a legal suit for the name Scene Creamers by a French graffiti artist collective of the same name, the band reverted back to the name Weird War, which they had used previously to record their first album "Weird War". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scene+Creamers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
