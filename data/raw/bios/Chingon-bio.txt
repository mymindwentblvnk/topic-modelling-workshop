Chingon is a Mexican rock band started by director Robert Rodríguez to record songs for his 2003 film Once Upon a Time in Mexico. The band features members of the Latin Rock band Del Castillo and Rodríguez on guitar. Chingon contributed on Mexico and Mariachis, a compilation album to Rodríguez' Mariachi Trilogy, and released their debut album, Mexican Spaghetti Western, in 2004.

Chingon also contributed their song "Malagueña Salerosa" to Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 2 – which Rodríguez scored – and a live performance by the band was included on the film's DVD release. They had also contributed to the soundtrack for Planet Terror.

The band's name comes from a Mexican slang term, chingón, meaning "badass." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chingon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
