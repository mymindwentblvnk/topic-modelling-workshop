DEMONSMOKE, formed in early 2015, hails from the slums of the Delta, Antioch CA. We play our own style of down-tuned heavy blues riffs with punishing rhythms, and aggressive vocals. Our influences include bands such as EYEHATEGOD, Weedeater, Graves at Sea, and Iron Monkey. We are a group of Riff n' Spliff peddlers, bringing a unique sound to the Bay Area.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demonsmoke">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
