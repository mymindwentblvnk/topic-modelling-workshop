As a member of Koln, Germany's Kompakt camp of experimental techno artists, Tobias Thomas takes on remix duties, occasionally produces, and also spins records as a DJ. In addition to his own releases on Kompakt sublabels such as NTA and Kreisel 99 (including productions as a duo with Michael Mayer), Thomas released a 2000 mix CD on Kompakt titled FÃ¼r Dich. Three years later, he followed it up with Smallville, another mix for Kompakt. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tobias+Thomas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
