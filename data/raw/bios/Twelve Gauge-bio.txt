After the break up of  "End Of Life" Kris Verbroekken and Johan Vesters kept on writing new songs. After a while they finally found a new drummer; Paul Miggiels, who already was a good friend of them. After a couple of weeks of working hard they decided to record a promo cd. Because they had no singer and bass player, Rob from Murder By Millions picked up the mic and Johan took the bass. When the promo was ready they decided to call their band 12 GAUGE. They're still looking for a new singer and a bass player. contact: b-townmetal@live.nl  and also check www.myspace.com/boxmeermetal
