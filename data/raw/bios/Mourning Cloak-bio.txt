There are multiple artists named Mourning Cloak:

1) Mourning Cloak was a psychedelic folk group based in Glenville, Pennsylvania, United States, formed in the early 1990s by Timothy Renner (Stone Breath).
After a few cassette releases, Mourning Cloak released the 7" EP "Stargazer" in 1995. Described as eerie space folk, it remains Timothy Renner's favorite Mourning Cloak work. It was also the first release by Timothy's label Hand/Eye.
