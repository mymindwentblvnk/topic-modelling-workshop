1) No Salvation formed in 2010, when guitarists Alex Valle and Brandon Parga met at Walnut High School and realized they both enjoyed the same music. After becoming fast friends, they decided to form a band. Starting out covering Children of Bodom and Slayer, they starting writing their own material, mixing Death Metal with Melodic Death Metal and Death-Thrash. Lyrical themes include, Death, Hate, Atheism, and societal issues.

Currently as of May 2011, they have finished writing a first album which has 13 tracks including 2 covers. In September, the band decided to hold off on recording, and has now written and begun recording a demo. The demo contains 4 new tracks not on the album, and 1 extra cover.
