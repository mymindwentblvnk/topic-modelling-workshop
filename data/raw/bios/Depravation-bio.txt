Depravation was founded as a five-piece band in Winter 2011. One year after their 2 track demo (I:PRAEDICTVM – 2012), they recorded their first LP (II:MALEDICTVM) at Tonmeisterei in Oldenburg.

In 2014, a split EP with Slowly We Rot from Belgium was released, followed by the four track strong EP Feast With The Rats via Per Koro Records. 2018, they released their split EP with Ancst. For this, they autonomously recorded their songs, which were mixed and mastered by Nikita Kamprad (Der Weg Einer Freiheit) at Ghost City Recordings.

Simultaneously, their preceding EP Feast With The Rats was repressed.
The split EP was the first release which was recorded as a four-piece band, after the original guitarist having to quit the band for family reasons. Since then, Depravation plays as said four-piece.

Throughout the years, Depravation played in a lot of German and European cities. Often in DIY venues, but also in bigger, commercial locations, where they were celebrated by metal heads as well as the Crust/Hardcore Punk audience. Beside several tours they have – especially in the last years – played on several festivals and travelled countless kilometers on the highway for many weekenders. This way, their shows sum up to approximately 30 per year. All the booking, merchandise and the band in general is run completely self-organized.
