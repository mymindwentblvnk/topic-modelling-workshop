Blood Hunt were formed in midsummer 2007 by Luben Baychinski (Bass),Simeon Krustev (Lead Guitar) and Dimitar Proynov (Rythm Guitar), whose brother  Ivan Proynov later joined the band as a drummer. They played mostly covers of heavy metal artists, but had two own songs. Later joined Ceco as a vocalist and Matio as a keyboardist. They played mostly in Luben's basement.

In September 2008 the lead guitarist Simeon Krustev left the band in pursuit of his own musical tastes. This was the end of BloodHunt , first band experience for most of the band members.

In Febuary 2009 ther will be a reunion. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/BLOOD+HUNT">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
