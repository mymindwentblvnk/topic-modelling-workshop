Autumn Inspiration is a 3-piece progressive metal band based in Kristiansand, that has been around for a couple of years. It actually started as a one man project, when Øystein Buer started writing the music before even thinking about performing it with a band. His cousin wrote the lyrics and he wrote the music. After a while the songs were ready to be recorded, and they got in touch with a really talented drummer, Jon Eirik Bokn, and Simen Rafoss, a great singer from the Oslo based band Defective. Together they recorded the demo In Our Final Leap which got good reviews from both Scream Magazine and Sweden Rock Magazine. A few months later, two great musicians joined A.I.: Ole Vistnes on bass and Anders Sørås on guitar. Unfortunately Simen was too busy with his main band, so he quit and it didn't take long after before things didn't work out with Anders. The three guys remaining were searching for people to fill the missing pieces, but no luck. So they took the matter in their own hands and did it them selves.
