There are two bands with the same name:
1.Colourfast, the Melodic Death/Thrash metal solo project band from Tokyo,Japan by Akira Naito.
The first demos that he released in '95 sold very well, and by '97 he had released three more.
By the U.S. method of immigration revising, he was forced to return home to Tokyo, Japan in ’97. He continued writing and eventualy released "The Art Of One" on CD in 2001.

2.ColourFast, the Australian indie pop/rock band,
members Marcel (keys/guitars/vocals), Sash (vocals/guitar) and Andy (bass) regrouped in Melbourne in 2005, after the split of their previous incarnation. Full of new sounds and musical visions, they practised anywhere and everywhere, the back of Sash’s bakery providing a handy rehearsal space. Anthony Argiro (Pseudo Echo) joined soon after on drums, infusing ColourFast with the new energy of his rhythmic flair.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Colourfast">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
