Los del Río (Spanish for Those from the River, referring to the Guadalquivir or the Guadaira) is a Spanish music duo composed of musicians Antonio Romero Monge and Rafael Ruíz. They are originally from the city section of Dos Hermanas in Seville. As a duo, Romero and Ruiz have been a consistent, and persistent, act since the early 1960s. They had achieved considerable attention in southern Spain by the time "Macarena" was written, but not without experiencing some hardship beforehand.

Los del Río specialized in Andalusian folk music, especially "sevillanas", the most typical and light music of Andalusia. For a number of years, Los del Río were known for attending private "jet-set" parties at Marbella. However, in the summer of 1996, the duo enjoyed the success of their multi-platinum smash summer hit "Macarena", which sold over four million copies in the United States and spent a record 14 weeks at #1. This is the longest running #1 debut single in American music history. It was because of the lone success of this song that Los del Río is considered a one-hit wonder. The song was also featured prominently in many other countries and sold extremely well in Australia. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Los+Del+R%C3%ADo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
