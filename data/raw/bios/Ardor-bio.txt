Ardor is a female fronted archetypal alternative/metal band hailing from Columbus, Ohio. Founded by guitarist Brian Gerbetz (formerly of the band Lateral Fold) in mid- 2008, Ardor has quickly surpassed the expectations of the Mid-West metal scene and abroad. Working with widely reknown producer Steve Dwyer (of the accredited bands Taproot/OnceOver), Ardor has been leaking tracks prior to their debut self-titled release due out in June, 2010. Already making waves with their originally unfamiliar, yet undeniably epic sound & gaining the respect of thousands of Avid Metal Listeners, Ardor has been working hard to give the media and the fans an experience unlike any other. 

Ardor is also an underground music producer.
