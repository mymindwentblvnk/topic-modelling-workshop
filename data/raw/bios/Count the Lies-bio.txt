Count the Lies is a dedicated, hard-working, four-piece, metal band based in the st. Louis area who formed in late 2006 as nothing more than a group of friends who loved to perform together. They started writing music over the years and played every venue in and out of their area shocking the Midwest local scene. Doing so quickly escalated the seriousness of the group. Over time they discovered a completely different style of music that keeps their heaviness while adding a more tasteful sound into the mix. With a surprisingly energetic live performance and an array of head-banging, circle-pit inspiring songs, the ever-growing fan base of the band continues to multiply every show. Though Count the Lies is not signed to a record label they recorded the Count the Lies demo with a good friend, Lee Skyles of Chunks of Meat Productions and released it on June 26th 2009. Later that year, Count the Lies parted ways with their former bass player, and in no time picked up Dylan Karg as thier newest member. With a new perminent line-up and a group of minds set on pushing the limits of modern metal, Count the Lies are ready to share their music with the world and are prepared to work as hard as possible to do so.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Count+The+Lies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
