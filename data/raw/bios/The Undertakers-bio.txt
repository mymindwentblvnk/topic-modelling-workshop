At least three artists have used the name The Undertakers: 

1) A Merseybeat group of the early 1960s remembered for songs like "Just a Little Bit" and "I Fell in Love." Jackie Lomax provided lead vocals for the popular group.

2) The Undertakers were Kevin Shapen, Jason Hill, Pat Yonally and Todd Kinner, a garage punk revival band from Eugene, Oregon. Formed in 1991 by five high school dropouts that were more concerned about chicks and beer than if they were gonna land a top 100 hit. Influenced by The Sonics, Wailers, Kingsmen and countless others, The Undertakers prided themselves on raw energy and teen anger. After two years of playing countless basement dives and seedy nightclubs throughout Washington and Oregon, the band was discovered by Fred Cole. Their debut and only single "Time Machine" was released on the label Tombstone in October 1991. 2001 saw the release of 13 "lost" Undertakers tracks -  resurrected and remastered - on the Dutch label No Brains Records.
