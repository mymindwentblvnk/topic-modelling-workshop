Slow, very heavy and loud traditional doom-metal band from France. Their music include some stoner, drone and even industrial elements. Main sounding created by distorting bass guitar groove and downtuned riffs with electronics sounds and gloomy clean voice. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Horrors+of+the+Black+Museum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
