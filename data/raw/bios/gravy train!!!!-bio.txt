Gravy Train!!!! Trashy electro band from Oakland, California with rapping about sex and junkfood, preferably in conjunction. If the music is explicit, then so is the stageshow. Many songs are about gay/lesbian love and in a typical concert all members make out with each other and encourage audience participation.
