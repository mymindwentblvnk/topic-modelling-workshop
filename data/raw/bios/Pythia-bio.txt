Pythia is a symphonic power metal from the United kingdom who were brought together by a love of gothic literature and metal. They are a group of classical and metal inspired musicians who believe that music is a lifestyle that should be lived only by the brave and true of heart.

Former lead singer Emily Alice Ovenden is perhaps better known as a member of the classical acts the Mediæval Bæbes and Celtic Legend. Drummer Marc Dyos and guitarist Ross White, from one of UK’s foremost thrash metal projects Descent are joined by classical pianist Richard Holland on keys, Tim Neale (Faith of the Few) on lead guitar and Andy Nixon-Corfield on bass.

The name Pythia is derived from Ancient Greek mythology and describes the chosen one who operated as a vehicle for translating Apollo's will into the prophecies which ruled the people. This great oracle's name in turn came from the Python, the monstrous serpent which Apollo had slain. The original Pythia was a virgin but after a grotesque imposition on her chaste nature, later Pythias were chosen for their great knowledge of the arts and literature.

In a world consumed with religious conflict and political confusion, it is time for a new era in musical reverence - it is time to worship at the shrine of the Serpent Goddess. Pythia currently resides in London, delighting in wantonness, excess and fantasy.
