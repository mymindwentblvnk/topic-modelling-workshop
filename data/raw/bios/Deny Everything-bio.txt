There are two bands using the name Deny Everything:

1) Deny Everything is a punk-band from cologne. They have an EP out on Risingriotrecords and a full length called "Fire This Time" on Yoyo Records, too. Their new EP "Speaking Treason" came out on Yoyo as well. They like to play shows. They don't like stupid tough-guy shit because in their book, hardcore is spelled p-u-n-k.

2) A Hardcore band from London UK in the vein of Straight Ahead, SSD and early Agnostic Front.  They released one seven inch on Burial Records called Through With This.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deny+Everything">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
