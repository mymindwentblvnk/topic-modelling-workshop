A 'second generation punk' band from Orange County, California, probably best known for the inclusion of two of their songs on the soundtrack to Michel Gondry-directed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ("I Wonder" and "Something.")  Michel Gondry seems to be a fan, as they also lent their talents to the Science of Sleep soundtrack ("Ulcer Soul" and "Making Certain.") <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Willowz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
