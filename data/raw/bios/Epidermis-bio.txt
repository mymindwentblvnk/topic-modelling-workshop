EPIDERMIS was considered, in the end of the 70’s, like the German GENTLE GIANT, but in regard with the group’s total discography, this might be quite reductive. They created a moving sonic dreamscape with keys, bass, acoustic and electric guitar, winds, percussion and cannon vocals. Their first album was progressive music of the very dense and complex type, with multi-layered vocal arrangements comparable to GENTLE GIANT and dynamic instrumental arrangements like YES and KING CRIMSON. The four tracks often had sudden shifts of tempo and mood, resulting in exciting music, which was at times disjointed. Often unfairly dissed as a clone band, EPIDERMIS managed to render the GENTLE GIANT realm being only a quartet. They recorded second album in the early 80’s called Muster-Burger

On the surprisingly very-good "Feel Me", recorded in the early 90’s with the same line-up and a bunch of guest musicians, the band offers a well-researched music, built on some precious sounds (flute, oboe, violin, clarinet, vibraphone) and some complex melodies, the music evolves between GENTLE GIANT ("Free hand" period), UNIVERS ZERO and ANABIS.

Recommended to Gentle Giant fans that enjoyed the “clones” like the Quebec group ET CETERA and the New England group HOWEVER.
