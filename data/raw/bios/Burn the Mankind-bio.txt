“The storm has begun when the hottest flames burned out the human mind, the indignation has lit the wick to the cremation of everything. Burn, end with all the sovereign power that deforms the man; everything must die, everything has to start over, and then, end again.” With this thought, Burn The Mankind was born.


Burn The Mankind is formed by:

Pedro Webster - Vocals and bass

Marcos Moura - Guitar

Matheus Montenegro - Drums

Raissan Chedid - Guitar


In early 2009, Marcos Moura (ex-Nephasth), Pedro Webster (Indulgence), Matheus Montenegro (The Ordher) and Raissan Chedid started the death metal project (later named Burn The Mankind) in Porto Alegre/RS/Brazil, with the purpose of making a serious and professional work and get known on the Brazilian and world metal scene, having as theme the criticism on the human existence.


Burn The Mankind plays Death Metal with Grindcore and Thrash Metal influences, combining heavy and velocity with great harmony and precision.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burn+The+Mankind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
