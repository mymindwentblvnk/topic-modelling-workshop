Tropic of Cancer started out as a duo consisting of Camella Lobo and her partner Juan Mendez. After releasing three EPs together, Mendez left in 2012 to devote himself entirely to his project Silent Servant, after which Tropic of Cancer became Lobo's solo project.

Drenched in romanticism and soaked in themes of solitude, mortality and love, Tropic of Cancer's music forms a strangely hypnotic connection with its listener. Camella Lobo's majestic vocals, warmly cradled by waves of ascending synths, plangent guitar, and foreboding beats, summon the listener into a world of dark decadence and delicate beauty. 

For a start, their devotees really are a disparate bunch: card-carrying Tropic of Cancer fans include techno refugees, dedicated shoegazers, dapper goths, paisley psych revivalists, minimal synth nerds and pop pickers; what links them all is that they care deeply about music, and have a weakness for morbid romanticism. Yet their strength is clarity, and an awe-invoking feeling of truth that individually we all must bear. The sound Tropic of Cancer make is ethereal and elusive but also exacting â€“ their lyrics are barely discernible, and yet this is music that really connects, really communicates. Yet, in some ways, a simple reminder of the uncharted emotional territory that lives within.
