Born and raised in Stockholm, Beldina Nelly Radoudi Nyadwe has family roots in Kenya - hence her artist name, Malaika (“angel” in Swahili), chosen in honor of her late grandmother. 

Beldina’s been running her movement - If I Were A Bell - on her own since 2010, getting love on MTV and around the blogosphere along the way. In March 2014 she put out the ‘Opening Act’ mixtape hosted by DjBooth, now followed by her debut EP ‘Intermission’.

Beldina has always had a strong passion for music. At the young age of 6 she started her vocal experience when her mom allowed her to join their local Church Choir; she also started taking Piano lessons on side. Her vocal and musical talent led her to pursue her music interest and she applied for Adolf Fredrik’s Music, Stockholm’s most prestige musical school. Out of thousand of children’s applying, Beldina Malaika was on the acceptance list. Learningg and maturing together with her musical exposure made her grow further beyond means as a singer, songwriter and a performer. 

Beldina has gained enormous exposure performing in different places in cities all over the world. She is now actively promoting her own music that has an even blend of pop, electro and soul tracks. In her own words she says: "Silence is the most powerful language; learn to speak with your heart before you say anything, and this is how I feel about my music. I want my voice to speak for itself; I want it to touch your soul so that you can feel joy, pain or love and to also inspire you in everyday life". Collaborating with artist such as Pharrell, Timbuktu and Childish Gambino has made her fan base grown to the next level and Beldina is a diamond in the rough on her path as a rising Star.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beldina">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
