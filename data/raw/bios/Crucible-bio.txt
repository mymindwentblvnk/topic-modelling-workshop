There are four different bands called Crucible - one prog rock, one christian rock, one folk and one metal.

The first Crucible is a blistering metal band with releases on No Idea records. The band contains vocals by popular illustrator Stenvik Mostrom. Band members were also in Anthem Eighty Eight, As Friends Rust, Assuck, Kumite, Salem, Tired From Now On and White Dove Frisbee Team.

The second Crucible has 5 members and the band had it's debut in 1998 with "Tall Tales". Their music shows a strong Gabriel-Era Genesis influence, and has been compared very favorably with that seminal prog band, their sound has its own strong identity, with the stated goal of evolving into a style recalling the best-known progressive bands of the 70s. The voice of singer Bill Esposito makes the sound of Crucible very striking and typical. The compositions are strong, with heavy usage of Hammonds, Mellotrons, moogs and flutes, among the usual.

The third Crucible is a young band from Austria and plays christian rock. Website: www.myspace.com/cruciblemusic
