“G o S l o w” is an independent solo artist residing in the Midwest USA 🇺🇸. Songwriter, Mason Thomas, has evolved the sound of G o S l o w over the years with heavy influences from early underground internet genres like: #witchhouse, #seapunk, and #based. Originally creating a MySpace music profile in 2008 and putting out demos recorded on a Casio piano in GarageBand. Never taking any musical  lessons or any knowledge of music production, G o S l o w became incredibly inspired by other internet artists such as: Salem, Lil B, Riff Raff, Wavves, and Pictureplane, plus the other thousands of people making music in their bedrooms.
Never falling quite into a perfect genre, he created his own hashtag called #weedmusic as a general statement that his music was written while being high. Almost every song features poetic rhymes over an electronic rap style beat.
