There is more than one band/artist with this name:

Missile is a Rock 'n' Roll trio from Dallas, Texas. Each member, Aaron, Ari, and Benji had tired of playing dead-end gigs and music they didn't believe in for other bands. Bender brothers, Ari and Aaron, had formed a band called Danger Runner and started writing and playing music they loved. As time progressed they went through drummers who weren't willing to put in the hard work it takes to make it. Only after the Benders picked up Benji Woerly as the "missing link" drummer was Missile formed. 

The first EP entitled "Heat Seeking" has been released though Missile has only been together a year. Hard work is already the norm! The guys stay busy with constant practicing, writing new material, producing music videos, recording, and playing shows. They opened recently for the Reverend Horton Heat at Trees in Dallas, a favorite venue. Missile has also been featured in a couple of national magazines. The next step is to take Missile on the road!
