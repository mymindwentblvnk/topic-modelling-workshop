Anarazel hails from Melbourne, Australia and plays the blackest of metal, comprising a unique mix of chaotic brutality amidst a brooding dark atmosphere. Lyrics are inspired by apocalyptic visions, sacramental mockery, cryptal perversion, chaos and blasphemy, and are delivered with a vocal style harshly capturing the cold emptiness of death itself.

Anarazel emerged from the Abyss early in 1996, with Morturus on drums, Zoltan on bass, Stuart on lead guitar and Maakryth on guitar/vocals. A typical metamorphosis followed which saw the release of two MCD/demos and a number of lineup changes. The most notable change occurred in April of 2000 when Stuart left Anarazel to focus on a solo project, ending his four year tenure as the band’s lead guitarist and chief song writer.

The addition of new members, Malleus (Clandestine), Valak (Coven), and Asassyn (Noschkya) enabled the band to reach its strongest point ever, playing numerous live shows in front of growing audiences. The MCD ‘Devil Hymns’, recorded in the latter half of 2000, indicated that the band had become faster, heavier and more brutal than ever, providing a perfect appetiser for the upcoming CD. Malleus and Asassyn departed the band in late 2001, making way for new bassist Asheron (Dead & Gory, Darkan).
