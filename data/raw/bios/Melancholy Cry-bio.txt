The birth of Melancholy Cry is dated on 1994 in Chelm, Poland. First line-up consists of: Piotr Nowosad (bass, voc.), Rafal Chmielewski (guit., voc.), Dawid Sznajdrowicz (dr.).
In 1995 Tomasz Luc (dr.), Tadeusz Jankowski (guit.) and Krzysztof Buda (viol.) join the band. This line-up records the "Lacryma Christi" demo.
In 1999 Melancholy Cry records a new promo, entitled "Mirror", however, due to poor sound quality, the release doesn't reach too many people.
Finally, in 2001, the band succeeds to record their full-length album in Hertz Studio. The music the band presents is not a Doom Metal anymore - different tempos, aggressive guitar and drums parts, sophisticated arrangments gives a fresh yet still "melancholical" output.
Last line-up: Michal Rusak (viol.), Tadeusz Jankowski (guit., also in Parricide), Rafal Chmielewski (guit., voc.), Piotr Nowosad (bass), Tomasz Luc (dr., also in Parricide). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Melancholy+Cry">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
