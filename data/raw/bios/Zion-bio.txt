Zion (also known as Zumbi) is also the solo artist name of the MC from the world famous underground rap group Zion I fame from Oakland California. Zumbi became fascinated by Hip Hop in its early stages; songs like "The Breaks" by Kurtis Blow and "Rock Box" by Run-D.M.C. got him hooked on the budding culture. He has said that Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest gave him lyrical inspiration, originally feeling that his unique vocal tone and style wouldn't be accepted. Zumbi wrote his first rhyme around 1990 during one of his Social Studies classes in High School. After continuing his writing, he gained the confidence to start rapping in local ciphers and began learning about critical aspects of rapping, like breath control, cadences and rhyme patterns.
