80's Brazilian crossover/thrash band that had their own brand of crossover mixing death/thrash/hardcore which was known as "deathcore" (not to be confused with the modern and popular genre)
In 1994 the band split-up and regrouped in 1998 after fans from the Finnish act Forca Macabra contacted them to make a project together. Armagedom has been touring since and a new album was out in 2008: "Sem Esperancas". Also in 2009 they had a 4 way split with Children of Technology, Nuclear Frost and Minkions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Armagedom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
