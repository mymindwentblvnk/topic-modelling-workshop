"Vosto, on his real name Vlad Ioan, is a young producer/performer, active since 2006, living and working in a small city tucked in the woods of the Carpathian mountains.

He is skilled in handling the guitar (both acoustic and electric) and had training in the mysteries of classical piano. Beside pickin’ strings and hittin’ keys he uses the computer as a tool for expressing the unknown from his soul.

Music produced by Vosto ranges from folk and classical rock to IDM, DNB and dubstep." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vosto">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
