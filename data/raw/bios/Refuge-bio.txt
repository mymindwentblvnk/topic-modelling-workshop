"Refuge mete out inexorable barrages of plodding guitar riffs, double bass drums, and blast beats, essentially a homogeneous, fifteen-minute soundtrack to cattle slaughterhouse footage.
Their sinister concoction of hardcore and metal should resonant with fans of bands like Falsifier, I AM, and Bodysnatcher (or The Acacia Strain, Lorna Shore, et al. if you widen your deathcore parameters)." - Roy Omed / Lambgoat

"Refuge have graced 2018 with one Hell of an EP. The Ninth Gate has excellent replay value, remarkable stopping power and punch to add. Defined by intensity and aggression, laden with mosh-friendly moments and ear-catching riffs and grooves both, Refuge’s latest release is an astounding testament to heavy music that doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel to be excellent."
-Connor Welsh

"Refuge is a band out of Long Island, NY that is obsessed with the heavy, groovy, violent aspect of hardcore & metal.
One of the most overwhelmingly heavy independent releases I’ve heard in a very long time."
