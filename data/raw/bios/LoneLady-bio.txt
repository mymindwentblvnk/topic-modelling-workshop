Signed to Warp, LoneLady is a pseudonym of Manchester, UK musician, songwriter and producer Julie Campbell.  Her psychogeography-inspired second album Hinterland was released in March 2015 to widespread critical acclaim, and shows dance and funk influences coming to the fore. The Quietus called it a "vibrant and urgent combination of genealogy and vision – and it is this that truly makes it a masterpiece." 

''Groove It Out'' was released November 2014 on 12'' and download and featured a remix by Ekoplekz.
''Bunkerpop'' was released February 2015 on 12'' and download and featured a remix by Wrangler.
All four singles released off Hinterland made the A-Playlist on BBC-6Music.

Her starkly urgent début album Nerve Up was released to critical acclaim in 2010.  The NME called it a "unique, brilliant debut ... we should celebrate LoneLady as the arrival of a fresh and invigorating voice whose talent transcends time and space and influence"[2] and it also drew praise from music journalist Paul Morley. From this, two singles were released: Immaterial (Nov 2009, Warp) and Intuition (Dec 2009, Warp).

LoneLady’s influences include: Gang Of Four, Wire, , Cabaret Voltaire, A Certain Ratio.
