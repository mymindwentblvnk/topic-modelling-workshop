Kapel Maister was female fronted symphonic metal band from Argentina, created in 2000, but wasn't active until 2004, when they had a stable alignment, with Gonzalo Solgarian on Guitar, Guillermo Da Rosa on the Bass, Nicolas Ferrero on Drums and the vocals Mariela Lemos and Luciana Queirolo.

They released one album, "Into Salvation," in 2005. They later recorded a demo in 2007 called "Peaceful Days," but split-up before they could make a sophomore album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kapel+Maister">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
