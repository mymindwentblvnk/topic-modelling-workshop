Sonic Violence were formed in Southend, Essex (UK) in the late 1980's by Andy Whiting and "Auntie", who had previously played in punk band The Synix. The band were among the first acts to be signed to Peaceville Records, although they had moved to its subsidiary label Dreamtime by the time of their second full-length ("Transfixion"). A third album was planned for 1993 but this never materialized. At last notice the band's line-up had expanded to accomodate two drummers, two bass guitarists, a full light-show and greater emphasis on electronic samples. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sonic+Violence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
