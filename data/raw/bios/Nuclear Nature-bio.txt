Dessau, Germany (2004 - present)

Nuclear Nature is a 5-piece Techmetal/Hardcore combo from Dessau/eastern Germany. After having played more than 40 shows in most parts of Germany their first studio EP will be released in early 2010. The upcoming tracks will sound unexpacted fast and technical, combining modern metal riffing with fancy song structurs and brutal hardcore surprises.
