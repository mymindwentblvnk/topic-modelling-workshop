David Borden (b. December 25, 1938 in Boston, Massachusetts) is an American composer of minimalist music. In 1969, with the support of Robert Moog, he founded what is considered to be the first synthesizer ensemble, Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Company. In addition to his work with electronics and the Mother Mallard ensemble, David Borden has written music for various chamber and vocal ensembles. He is also an accomplished jazz pianist.

Borden's compositions are heavily influenced by the repetitive minimalist style of Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley. Borden is also very interested in counterpoint, best demonstrated in his large scale series of works The Continuing Story of Counterpoint, Parts 1-12.

David Borden was commissioned to write the score to the 1973 film The Exorcist by director William Friedkin. However, less than a minute of Borden's music was actually used in the film (Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells was prominently featured on the soundtrack instead.)

Borden participated in the many activities surrounding the 30th anniversary of the founding of Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Company in 1999, including several live performances and CD reissues on the Cuneiform record label.

He is currently the Director of the Digital Music Program at Cornell University. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/David+Borden">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
