Super Happy Story Time Land was born from the fevered dreams of a heroin-addicted Vietnam War veteran, in the year of the Lord 1982.  He wrote down the music composition in magic marker on old 101 Diner take-out menus, and stored them in an old foot locker.

He was killed several months later in a lumber mill accident.

The music didn't turn up for 20 more years, when his grandson found the music and formed a band around it.  That is Super Happy Story Time Land.

With the help of a kindly old Metalhead they have since been launched into super stardom. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Super+Happy+Story+Time+Land">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
