SKULLP is a Trash/Hardcore band from Cluj Napoca - Romania, formed at the beginning of the year 2008 with the initial members:
Cristian Aionese - vocals
Adrian Suciu - guitar
Dan Dumitru - guitar
Vasile Pop - bass
Rareș Groza - drums

In June 2009, the band faces some chances regarding the band membership. After several modifications, the band reunites in a stable form, having their newest members Ionuț Tăutan as rhythm guitarist, Cătălin Moraru for vocals, Bogdan Paștiu as drummer and Doru Nedelcu for sampling and FX.
The band participates at several local gigs and festivals around the country sharing the same stage with international names like Pro Pain, Born From Pain, Torture Squad, Hate, Cilice, Undivided, Moonspell, Paricide and many more.

With a lot of hard work and devotion, and without a record label the band manages to release in the fall of 2010 their first EP entitled  "Evolution through genocide...?", self-promoting it by touring around the country. 

SKULLP struggles to maintain at the surface in the underground music industry, having their first video for the single ”Stand up and fight!” released on the 11th of February 2012.
In short time the band has another member changing, Cătălin being replaced by Alin Enache for vocals, and their rythm guitarist Ionuț Tăutan also leaving the band.
In the present, SKULLPs members are:
Alin Enache - vocals
Adrian Suciu - Guitar
Vasile Pop - bass
Bogdan Paștiu - drumms
Doru Nedelcu - sample/FX

Momentarily the band is working on their new album which is planned to be released somewhere at the end of 2012.
