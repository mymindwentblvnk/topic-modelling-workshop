Josef Mysliveček (March 9, 1737 – February 4, 1781), nicknamed "Il divino Boemo" (The Divine Czech) was a Czech composer in the Galant tradition. He was born in Prague, one of twins who were sons of a prosperous mill owner, and studied philosophy at the university there before following in the footsteps of his father. The enthusiastic reception in Prague of a series of six symphonies in 1762 encouraged him to give up his studies in favour of music; with a bursary from count Vincent von Waldstein he went to Venice in the following year to study with Giovanni Pescetti. He won over the Italian audience with his initial opera, Bellerofonte, and at once ranked among the top Italian composers of opera seria. He was also a favorite in Bohemia, where operas were accompanied by new religious texts in order that they could be sung even in church. He was labelled "Il divino Boemo Venatorino" by the Italian public. His success is based on inexhaustible melodic invention, connected with Italian technique and coloration.

His vivacious personality endeared him to the Mozart family when they met in Bologna in 1770: "He exudes fire, spirit and life", wrote Wolfgang. There is no doubt that Myslivecek's Italianate style influenced Mozart a great deal in opera, symphonies, and violin concertos. 

Apart from 28 operas, he also wrote 10 oratorios and cantatas, numerous chamber music scores, and orchestral and concert music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Josef+Myslive%C4%8Dek">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
