Czech Republic (2010 - present) 

Horrible Creatures, a band playing thrash/death metal since 2010 begun as an innocent project, maybe jam, between guitarist Vl√°dis and drummer George.
After a few succesful rehersals, brilliant switches of ideas and riff salves, join this project also singer Frank.
Months later, almost years, of discontinuous rehersals split the three back and pick up the bassist John.
With first material, now a full band, decided to do the first shows.
After first gigs went the band, after years of stinking in the garages, to the studio, slog to make their first EP.

At the beginning of the year 2015 released the band their first EP Depressive Hunt.


"We just want to make heavy and uncompromising music and make what we love.
So be prepared for a solid load of massacre in bringing the most fucked up metal..."
