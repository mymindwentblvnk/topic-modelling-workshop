Erik Sanko is the leading light in the much admired Skeleton Key and was an original member of John Lurie's Lounge Lizards. He also helps out such luminaries as Yoko Ono, Danny Elfman and John Cale from time to time. But "Past Imperfect, Present Tense" is 100%, undiluted Sanko. He wrote, sang and played everything on the album. Sounding like the journals of an alchemist set to the music of your grandmother's broken pump organ, Sanko fashions oddly compelling songs from mangled melody and ragged scraps of rhyme. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Erik+Sanko">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
