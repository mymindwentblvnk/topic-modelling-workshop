B.O.T. ( http://www.botband.nl/home ) is a band from the nothern town Groningen in the Netherlands.  The perfect mix of complicated music, simplicity and humor lead to banal nonsense (banale onzin in Dutch). Enjoying the music is a mind expanding therapy for anyone that wants to think (and keep thinking) outside the box. In which musical box should we place B.O.T.? They describe their music as crazy freak rock, freak of the 70’s rock with a new flavor. Anyway, anything is allowed and no border too far. The songs are multilingual: Dutch, English, French, German, Brusnavskic and Arabic. 
2002 B.O.T. participated in the “Rode Oortjes Festival” in the “Platformtheater” in Groningen. In the first round they were declared 'Best of the Rest'. Neil left the band and B.O.T. temporarily continued as a power trio. Then, at a football match Walter discovers the vocal volume of Erik and he makes his debut as a singer with B.O.T. at a 2003 concert. And with succes. At the end of 2004 guitarist Rolf joins B.O.T. 
B.O.T. plays at several occasions, sometimes several times a month, sometimes with a break of several months. End 2005 Arf and Martino leave B.O.T. 
Just now they released a new video clip of their song black eyed thunder, check it out  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImjlcFuHKv0 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/B.O.T.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
