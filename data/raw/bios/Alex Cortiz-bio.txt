Worldwide critically acclaimed and succesful chill out/downtempo producer. Homebase Amsterdam/The Netherlands. Travelling from early triphop to downtempo listening pearls with jazz, funk, bossa and cinematic influences and from there to warm deephouse and minimal mesmerising techno. 
With the Dutch #1 album Moodfood (2000) (followed by albums such as Make believe and Mesmerising), he set a standard and was connected to the likes such as Kruder & Dorfmeister, Sven van Hees and Air.
His 7th and last album was the surprising Lo Tek, loaded with chilled minimal techno and dub. Right now Mr. Cortiz is working on an album with 70’s blaxploitation, FM and funk, mixed with the sounds of now.
Furthermore he creates music under a wide range of pseudonyms. He brought you D-Shake's Yaaah and TechnoTrance (1991), techno-hits that filled dancefloors worldwide. But maybe you know him from Flygang (cosmic disco, disco deluxe, blaxploitation), Paradise 3001 (ambient techno, dub, techspace), Cat Scanner, (subtle techgrooves and trance) or Dish Cuts (funky trippin’ breaks). And there is much more. You can visit his website http://www.alexcortiz.com or the Beatport-store at www.beatport.com
