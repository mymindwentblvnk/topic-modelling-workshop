Dibbukim is a Swedish Folk Metal band with lyrics exclusively on Yiddish. The band was born in 2009 when Ida and Niklas Olniansky got the idea of starting a Yiddish Metal band. Old friend Magnus Wohlfart was soon recruited and the work of a full-length album began. The first track for the upcoming release, "Oyfn veg shteyt a boym" (an old jewish folk song), was recorded in February 2010. As a teaser for the album, the song was released as a CD-single and digital download through GM Music on April 28th. 

The full-length album "Az a foygl un a goylem tantsn" was released in April 2011.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dibbukim">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
