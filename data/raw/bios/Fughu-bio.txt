FUGHU is a progressive metal band originating from Buenos Aires, Argentina. They were formed in 1998, but it wasn't until 2009 that they released their debut album titled Absence.

The album can be described as progressive metal in the vein of DREAM THEATER in SYMPHONY X, though FUGHU does have their own sound. It contains 12 songs, and is definitely worth a listen for someone looking for some good new progressive metal.

Their popularity in the progressive metal community began when they were DREAM THEATER's opening act in March 2008 during their tour in Argentina. FUGHU shows a lot of potential with their debut, and it is recommended for any prog metal fan. If FUGHU continues down the road they began with Absence, I'm sure they can become one of the great progressive metal bands.
