1) Gluttony is a Death Metal band from Sundsvall, Sweden.

2) Gluttony is a young death metal band hailing from Croatia.

Pure hate is seeping through Rudfrosts vocal chords, primal yet complex beat derives from Nedo the peasants drums, power is given from Marco the White (A.K.A. the emotional robot) through his charity given bass guitar & finally the two guides to the core sound of Gluttony are Styp (the kind dictator) and Dama-ge (The all knowing fool)

Together combined they try to shake and rejuvenate people’s rotten minds,scratch the surface of existentialism & sending a good & healthy vibe through your spine !

In the fall of 2013 they have recorded first promo CD entitled “Compulsive”. Band’s current occupation is working on new songs and playing live shows !
