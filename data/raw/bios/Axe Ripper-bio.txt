Axe Ripper is an extreme metal band from Detroit, Michigan, formed in 2010 by core founding members Kyle Whitefoot and Louie Badalament, with the aid of additional members Kenny Kiser and Rob Barker. After constantly playing local venues and house shows since it's incarnation, the band self-released their first full length album, "Welcome To Detroit Destruction" in April of 2012, and began touring in support of it later that year.
A split 7" EP with their Minneapolis thrash metal cohorts, Lockgnar, was released in 2013, alluding a departure from the traditional metal and melodic hardcore-influenced sound of their debut album and focusing heavily on their crossover/thrash metal roots. The band remains active by performing high energy (and sometimes chaotic) live shows, locally and outside of their hometown regularly, as well as constantly writing new material and perfecting their ever-changing sound. 
Entering their third year, Axe Ripper began to further abandon the clean and melodic style of metal as heard on their debut, in exchange for a much heavier and abrasive sound influenced mainly by (but not limited to) thrash, death metal, and crust punk bands. With this newfound style and a slew of new material under their belt, AR entered the studio in early 2014. Their sophomore album, "Hell Is Real", is now currently in the works, and set to be released later this year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Axe+Ripper">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
