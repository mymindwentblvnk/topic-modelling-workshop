Prostitution has concocted an assaulting mix of thrash, prog and pounding black metal. Forming in May of 2009 after having nothing better to do, the crew of insanely diverse musicians came together, writing songs and practicing incessantly, readying to play a long list of venues. Prostitution is made up of Jesse Adelson (bass/vocals), formally of The Hard Up's and Knives Everywhere, Russ Cowen (guitar/vocals), from The Concubines, and Ben Bloom (drummer/vocals), from the hardcore outfit Abberance. The band is set to release their self-produced debut EP, “Daughter of Sin”, which was recorded and mixed at their Brooklyn practice space—aiming to get the best sound out of where they play most. They take inspiration from seminal bands like The Blood Brothers, Pg. 99, Slayer, Deicide, Death, Protest the Hero and the Misfits. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Prostitution">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
