The name Ditchwater has been around with various line ups, demoing material and playing shows since the mid 90's. In 2002 founding member Mark Anderson (Guitar) and Mike Meadows (vocals) paired up to form the core of the classic line up.

They quickly made a name for themselves throughout the Midwest, including headlining gigs at renown Chicago venues Metro, House of Blues and Double Door. The band routinely opened for national acts such as Mudvayne, In This Moment, Soil and Powerman 5000.
In 2006, the single "It's Over" from their debut album "Going Forward Looking Back" received strong radio play including being put into full rotation on XM Radio Squizz Channel 48 (Now SiriusXM Octane). The video for the song has amassed over 20,000 views on YouTube and received airplay in the summer of 2006 on CBS TV's Morning show in the "Living Room Live Contest" where the band placed 2nd from over 10,000 submissions.
After years of non stop work the band slowed down and took time off to pursue other interests. Occasional shows and single releases would follow from 2007 to 2014.

In December of 2015 the band returned to full strength. Rounding out the line up is the return of Jason Angone on drums (2005 to 2011) and original second guitarist Kevin James (1995) along with newcomer John Partipilo on bass. To mark the groups return the new album "Into the Storm" was released on January 15th. This album contains all the tracks recorded from 2007 up to 2014.
The band will be hitting the studio to record brand new material in in early 2016...
