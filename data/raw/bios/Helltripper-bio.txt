HELLTRIPPER was born in early year 2008 anno bastardi, by Impaler and Hellfiend. The main idea was create the metallic mayhem in the vein of VENOM (they early singles and first two albums is the main influence to Helltripper members). Lyrically HELLTRIPPER is morbid Satanic misogynism, Devil-worship, orgies with the dead, and so on... In the January 3 demos (on cd-r) was released: Fucked Up Rehearsals (Demo 2008 - 2trx) Raw Fucking (Demo 2008 - 1 tr) Black Bitch (Demo 2008 - 5 trx). This stuff not for sale - for promotion,trades,friends only. Now band working on 4-5 new advance tracks and looking for some Europe-based label for release this stuff on vinyl,tapes,cd... Well, metal maniacs, zines and unholy hordes also can get in touch! Note: Helltripper never was and never will be a live band. Fuck the proffesional studio recordings, garage-quality rules supreme! Like this shit was recorded in 1981. Fuck off commercial!     <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Helltripper">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
