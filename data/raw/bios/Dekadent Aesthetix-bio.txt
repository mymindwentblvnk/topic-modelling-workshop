Dekadent Aesthetix was a metal band from Bern-Switzerland formed by Kourtney Davis  (all instruments) and Vincent Paulie (vocals) in the winter of 2008. Having deep roots in Black Metal, the band constantly incorporates diverse and contradictory musical elements to achieve eccentric sounds that are not supposed to have a special appeal to any music scene. The music production is totally minimalist, absolutely independent, and extremely low-budget.


The first official Dekadent Aesthetix release was a split 7" ep vinyl with the legendary Norwegian band JOYLESS issued on 22 September 2009 by the belgian label Dismal Cursings.

The eponymous debut album of the band has been released after few months from the split with Joyless, on 1 January 2010 on the Australian label GOATOWAREX. The album features the primitive demo songs along with new compositions that show the more experimental side of the band's music. Both the old tracks and the new ones are mastered in Sweden at Unisound Studios by Dan Swan√∂ (Nightingale, Bloodbath, Edge of Sanity, Katatonia).

Due to lack of gear and financial difficulties the band went on hiatus in 2011.
