From their Myspace :

The Terrordactyls are Michael Cadiz and Tyrel Stendahl. 

Michael was Born in Baltimore, Maryland. Tyrel is from Tukwila, Washington. Their birth places are the source of their magic, speed and unusually superior upper-body strength. They are both extremely lovable and popular individuals. Michael’s interests include: fabricating truths on job applications, multiple choice questions and running away. Tyrel enjoys guns, organizing his itunes music library and being good at life. 

Originally a quartet, The Terrodactyls once featured Brendhan Bowers on drums and Scott Yoder on guitar. The two eventually left the band because they were no longer willing to participate in the rigorous daily regimens of weight lifting and jumping jacks required by the group’s image consultant, Extremeline. 

During the brief periods that Michael and Tyrel are away from the gym, they enjoy watching inspirational sports films and talking about their abs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Terrordactyls">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
