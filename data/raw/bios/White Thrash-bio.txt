This revved up punk rawk team of Clusterfuck Clute, Jason the Argonaut, Mad Man Matt Hank Dale, and "The Flying Leprechaun" John Forney make up the anti-sensation known only as White Thrash! A clever mix of punk/metal riffs, deafening amplifiers, ludicrously fast songs, chorus-like back vocals, and absurd lyricism create an atmosphere that will turn a crowd from clapping their hands to rioting in the streets. Count yourself among the tens of screaming fans, and slam-dance your way to a headache provided by White Thrash!
