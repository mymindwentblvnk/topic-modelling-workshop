Back From Ashes is a progressive metal band forged in the Valley of the Sun, Phoenix, AZ. Over the past 10 years, the band's members worked on separate projects, and it wasn't until 2004 that everything fell into place. It started with Mike and Jason, guitarist and songwriter. Through a number of grueling auditions they finally found Dave on the drums, and John on bass. It was then they realized they had found something special. The music they created is both raw and powerful, with jaw-dropping drums, hard-edged guitar riffs, and ferocious vocals delivering lyrics that reach out to the audience, grab it by the throat, and obliterate conscious thought. To see them is an experience, and the reaction to their shows has been more than even they could have expected. With a strong and loyal fan base to fuel them, Back from Ashes finished our first album that is sure to take listeners by surprise. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Back+from+Ashes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
