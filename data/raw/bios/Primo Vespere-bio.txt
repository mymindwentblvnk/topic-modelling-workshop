Primo Vespere is a Progressive Death and Melodic Death Metal band from Venice (Italy) founded in 2009 by Davide Lazzarini (voice) and Giacomo Berton (drum). Until 2011, the band never found a complete balance between members and songs, despite the several live concerts around Venice.
With the EP “Crushed Instability” they have reached an important goal, finally establishing a stable formation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Primo+Vespere">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
