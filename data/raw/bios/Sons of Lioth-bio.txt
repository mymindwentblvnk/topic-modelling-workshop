Sons of lioth is an old school heavy metal band, founded in 2005 in Herenthout, Belgium. 
Guitarists Ben Cavens (Sublimo) and Danijel Cecelja (Supremo) gathered drummer Tim Van Herck (Priapismo), singer Kristof Van Den Bergh (Extravaganzo) and bass-player Davy Van Bel (Calypso) to record their first demo in 2006. It was called Destination Earth. The professionalism of the musicians was immediately clear in the 5 well composed and perfectly performed songs.
Only a few months later, another 5 songs were unleashed on the crowd during one of their gigs and got great response. 
The high quality of vocals and guitar work didn't go by unnoticed and the demo got great reviews in the Flemish Rock and Metal magazine "Mindview", and it's Dutch counterpart "Aardschok".
The band's style has been associated with Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Manowar, Hammerfall and the likes.
In december 2009 the first full album was completed. Legends was released with a spectacular show, nicknamed Legendary tour, at a local venue. This album is also self-produced so it is only available through the bands website and at shows.
