A new Danish band sees the dark of night.. 
XCentrik's album debut: Welcome To The War, is a rock-release apart from the regular run-of-the-mill. XCentrik define their own style as `Heavy Mental`, with deep roots in classic rock, and from there the boys spin their neo-futuristic acid-universe..

Now don't be mistaken: XCentrik are really hard-hitting indeed - when they want to, but the experience of the listener becomes much more interesting because there's always an eerie sense of variation of dynamics present, a sense which left metal-rock in general ages ago, in it's quest for ever more massive soundscapes.

XCentrik offers inventiveness, ingenuity, humour, very heavy mental, and a musical vision that'll give the listener inner-sreen-movies, cold sweat and sheer and utter excitement as the plot develops.

XCentrik is a powertrio in the most classical sense: Think 'King`s X', 'Hendrix Experience', 'Cream' ... but with the addition of electronic wizzardry. 
The crew:
Jan Weincke - Vocals, Guitar, Keys and Production
(Valen)Tino Olsen - Drums and madness
