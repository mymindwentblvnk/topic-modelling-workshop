Biography

Adelaide five piece metal outfit Voros formed in mid-2012 and features members of Australia’s Double Dragon and A Red Dawn.

Former A Red Dawn and Double Dragon members Joshy Lamont (bass) and Davin Buttery (guitar) teamed up with Double Dragon's Liam Weedall (drums) and set about establishing a new band that would incorporate elements of several metal sub-genres, while staying true to their Australian heavy metal instinct. The recruitment of guitarist Cameron Dodds and later vocalist Tyson Braithwaite would round out the five-pronged attack.

With a full lineup in place, Voros began recording the six tracks in 2013 that would make up the band’s debut release, ‘The Sky Burial EPs: Part I, II & III,’ which has been unleashed on the world and available for free online via http://voros.bandcamp.com.

‘The Sky Burial EPs: Part I’ was released on February 18. The the EPs opening track, 'Woes Of Disdain' can be heard here: http://soundcloud.com/voros-metal/voros-woes-of-disdain. ‘The Sky Burial EPs: Part II’ was released June 31 and features two more tracks from the band, "Pollaxe" and "Death Throes", while Part III has been released on November 6 2013.

Audiences were first treated to Voros' infectious and boundlessly heavy grooves in their live routine for the first time in mid 2013, and there's a full Australian tour planned for later in the year. Moreover, Voros’ balance of experience, skill and desire has them aptly set to share their unique brand of Australian metal with the world.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Voros">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
