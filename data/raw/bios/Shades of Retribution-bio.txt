Shades Of Retribution was formed  in January,2010. They have an old school base , deriving influences from the Assamese culture and the other regions of North-East. This being said the lyrics are in Assamese and are in context to the never ending quest for survival in this region. The sound draws influences from Thrash/Death (Cannibal Corpse,Testament,Kreator,Death,Six Feet Under) to name a few. “Idealogies forms the concept of One Tribe and One Sound”,which the band firmly believes. 
They released their debut album "Xongram" on 17th of December 2010.
