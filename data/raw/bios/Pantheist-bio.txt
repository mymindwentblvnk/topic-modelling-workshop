Doom metal band, originally based in Belgium and later in the UK, with progressive overtones and a heavy dose of melancholy. Although originally associated with the funeral doom scene, the band has developed a more complex sound in their later work, incorporating elements from progressive and classic rock alongside the original influences from doom metal, classical and ethnic music. Typical for their sound is the creation of a solemn, mystical atmosphere, to which elements such as atmospheric keyboards, acoustic instruments and semi chanted vocals strongly contribute. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pantheist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
