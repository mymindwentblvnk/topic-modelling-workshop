Greg Feldwick is 23 years old and from Bath, UK. He makes noises as Slugabed. His first releases were on stuffrecords, Ramp Recordings and then, Planet Mu, but now he is signed to the mothership, Ninja Tune Records. His music is suffused with a unique mix of humour, next level production, dancefloor smarts and melancholic emotion. 

Asked to explain "Time Team", Feldwick responds that "it's to do with deep feelings about mostly inexpressible things." It is indeed an album full of feeling and warmth and humor, a remarkable feat for a record composed mainly on synthesisers and drum machines.
