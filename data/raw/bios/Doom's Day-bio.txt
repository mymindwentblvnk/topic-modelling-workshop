Hailing from the Quebec city region in QC, Canada, this new project is taking the local scene by storm... and then some. 

Doom’s Day is a trip back to the roots, when metal music was Satan himself and punk music had a true meaning of rebellion. Influenced by legendary bands such as The Misfits, Venom, Brocas Helm, Black Sabbath and Mercyful Fate, the band began its journey in the evilest way. Sacrifices, orgies and other rituals are what matter, but with thoughts on modern society’s wickedness, addictions and other insanities…

Doom’s Day is truly a tribute to a dark music genre mostly forgotten and also a big fuck you to all those trendy whores of the music scene…

Altough deeply rooted in the 80's, DOOM'S DAY still sounds refreishing enough to compete with the best artists of a similar vision on an internatioal level. DOOM'S DAY is strongly recommended to fans of VENOM, GHOST, MERCYFUL FATE, THE MISFITS (old), HEAVEN AND HELL...
