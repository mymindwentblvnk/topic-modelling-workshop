A spin-off of seminal NYC rock group The Dictators, MWK has one major release to their credit: the evergreen ...And You?, a collection of punky tunes perhaps best summed up by the fun, catchy single "The Party Starts Now!!" Formed in late 1986 by ex-Dictators Andy Shernoff and Handsome Dick Manitoba along with fifth Ramone Daniel Rey (Rabinowitz), the band quickly earned a reputation as a great live band in the New York to New Jersey area. Legendary Dictator/Manowar axeman Ross the Boss replaced Rey in 1989, and the band's CD was released in 1990.

Twenty-five minutes of blazing, cleanly recorded heavy metal influenced punk rock, the disc received a huge fan response. Combining Manitoba's throaty vocals with Shernoff's fast, catchy, hook-filled songs, and quite funny (and sometimes chilling lyrics), punk crirics regarded it as a must. MWK evolved back into The Dictators with the return of Scott "Top Ten" Kempner to the fold in 1991. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Manitoba%27s+Wild+Kingdom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
