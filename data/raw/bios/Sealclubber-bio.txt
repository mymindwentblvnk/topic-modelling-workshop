Sealclubber are a hardcore punk, crust influenced sludge band from West Midlands, United Kingdom. The have two releases to date, a 2-song ep titled "Sticky River" and a full length "Stoical" in 2016. They are available at https://sealclubber.bandcamp.com.

Sealclubber formed late in 2012 with a desire to make horrible music. 

The 1st EP 'Sticky River' released via Carnage Club and Witch Hunter Records. 

Debut album 'Stoical' available now via Medusa Crush Recordings.

"The band has evolved a lot in the intervening years however, and ‘Stoical’ is a far more varied and accomplished beast than the EP, recalling both Old Man Gloom’s penchant for experimentation and gut rupturing heaviness. ‘Vows Of Silence’, the album’s penultimate track, is a perfect example of their dynamic and crushing sound."

"With divergent influences, comes great risk, but with great talent, comes great reward." 
- Wonderbox Metal 

"With their barbed riffs and the pitch-black ugliness of Drunk Dad and Trap Them, Sealclubber feel like Deadguy if they lasted long enough to have an experimental sludge phase. Like the bands mentioned, Sealclubber’s songs aren’t just sutured opiate-abusing crusty gutterpunk riffs tuned to the brown note. Even in a furious barnburner like “Haima,” the song scavenges elements of hardcore and stoner metal to create a richly textured soundtrack for giving and receiving shit news." 
-Mister Growl 

"Sharply focussed, bristling with provocative intent, Sealclubber's early but brief promise has been realised to the full."

"Sealclubber‘s first full-length record is without a doubt, tremendous. The scathing sludge, the blistering pseudo crust, the brooding atmospheres and the frostbitten melancholia all come together in unholy matrimony on this absolutely solid effort. Any fan of sludge or post-metal would be doing themselves a disservice not to have their day ruined by the depressive chaos of Stoical."
-Svbterranean

"The music here isn't for everyone, but those who can hear it will cherish it for it's beauty, ugliness, power, and emotion."
