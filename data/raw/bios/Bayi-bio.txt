Bayi was formed in late 2002 as a harsh, mysogynistic one man cybergrind project. While having released over a dozen demos, EP's, splits and a pair of full lengths as well as executing a handful of live performances the project has been plagued by a constant flux of additional members, mainly vocalists and bassists. The current line up is two men (a vocalist and a guitarist) and they occasionally record and release new material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bayi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
