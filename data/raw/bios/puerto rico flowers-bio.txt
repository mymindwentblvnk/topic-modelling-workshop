Bass/Drums/Synthesizer/Vocals found here. Slow songs not unlike a skinhead crying. John Sharkey III wrote and recorded them. He lives in America and Australia. Yes, he used to be in Clockcleaner but he also used to be a smoker. He gave that up a long time ago. Performances are seasonal and enjoyable.
