Niklas is originally from the big city, but lives in the countryside now. Aged four he played his first notes on the piano of his grandparents. Aged five he took piano lessons by his own request. Unlike other musicians, who feel a longing to move to world metropoles, Niklas, after having northern German harbors, seagulls, and fish markets in his life now enjoys the southern loneliness of forests, wide landscapes and the fragrant scent of pine woods. 
Inspired by both worlds Niklas creates an acoustic symbiosis in form of enchanting piano compositions with fine electronic additions on his EP „Tuur mang Welten“.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Niklas+Paschburg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
