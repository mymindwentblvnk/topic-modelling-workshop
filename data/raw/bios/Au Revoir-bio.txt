A (mostly) Instrumental band with its origins in New Jersey, Au Revoir plays a brand of dark and heavy Post-Rock that puts them further and further into the Post-Metal realm with each subsequent release. Their debut, "In The Key of Night" was released in 2012, followed by the "Black Hills EP" in 2013. Touring often, they focus on building a community around them, with a very DIY approach to making music.

"Au Revoir have progressed leaps and bounds in only a small amount of time and I really hope that this new found style on ‘Black Hills’ is something they pursue going forward. I also hope that other listeners make the same connections to this album as I have. I tend to let my imagination run away in the playground that is Post-Rock and am thankful that ‘Black Hills’ has offered me an escape that is a much darker, heavier experience than I’m used to." - Postrockstar.com's review of "Black Hills" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Au+Revoir">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
