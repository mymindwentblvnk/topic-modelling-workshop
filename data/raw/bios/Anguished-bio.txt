Cold cuts you deep with razors of melancholy and hateful despair! Possessed Demoness, the tortured soul of Anguished, creates and performs hymns of this Finnish one woman howl with a very unique touch! The songs are full of suicidal despair and sadness but Anguished also shows a side of worshipping Satan with devoted words of dedication to the bleak darkness. As Possessed Demoness handles all instruments with the help of a session drummer she also performs the lyrics with soul piercing shrieks reminding of the early Cradle of Filth high-pitched screams! This is the debut release of Anguished and proofs the bands strenght and interesting approach on Finnish Black Metal! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anguished">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
