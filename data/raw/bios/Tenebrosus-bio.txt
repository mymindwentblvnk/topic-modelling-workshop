Tenebrosus was founded in May 2000 by two brothers: Valefor (guitar) and Hades (drums) and Michal (vocals). Their first and utmost inspiration was Norwegian Black Metal scene; however, the future was to show that it actually didn't influence their musical style a lot. After nine months of intense rehearsals the band entered the Selani Studio, where they recorded their promo material ``Tenebrosus - Promo 2001``. It was released by the band without any financial support (500 copies in CDR format) and was received really well both in Poland and abroad. In the meantime Tenebrosus played a few gigs; they also finished work on their new material. But unfortunately problems came then and Tenebrosus had to suspend their musical activity for a while. After this break the band was joined by a bass player M.. Their promo material was re-edited in the end of 2002 in Spain (by Wolf Records.) as split-MC. with Angmar form Finland. It was released in the limited edition of 166 hand-numbered copies. In the beginning of 2003 Worm Tongue became a new vocalist. Shortly after the band prepared pieces for their first full-length ``The Fall of Worthless Morals``. and signed a deal with Metal Mind Productions.
