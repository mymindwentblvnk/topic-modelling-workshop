Lyves is the alias of Francesca Bergami. Her emotive lyrical themes and alternative route into performing have set her apart from most other artists and earned critical acclaim for her early releases. 

Born in Aylesbury to an Australian mother and an Italian father, before spending most of her younger years on the move, Francesca is fluent in Portuguese and Italian. Her interest in music can be credited to her parent’s vast record collection that she started sifting through from the age of four. “I was more attentive to them than anything else in the house,” says Francesca. “My first musical memory was Dire Straits, then I remember a lot of Michael Jackson and singers like Sade and Sinead O’Connor. I exhausted every single thing my parents had. I didn’t really realise how much I loved music back then.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lyves">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
