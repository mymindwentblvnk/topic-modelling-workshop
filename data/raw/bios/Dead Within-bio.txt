We were founded in 2005 on a DEMO band festival in Zadar "baterijada". The day after was a meeting of the first four members of the band HedY (vocal, rhytm guitar), File (ex solo guitar), Frane (drummer) and Gogo (Bass) who joined the band later and we started playing cover songs of Iron Maiden and Metallica. Later a new member joined the band, √êuro (Keyboards) and we started to cover COB' s songs. We started our first show as a Children Of Bodom tribute band and it went pretty well for the first time. The setlist was: Everytime I Die, Hate Me!, Silent Night, Bodom Night, Downfall and Oops! I Did It Again! You can see a video of Hate Me! down there. Time went by and we started to record a demo. It didn't go on as planed. First we realized that there wasn't much enthusiasm in the band and none of the guys weren't interested of composing a song!! So the planned recording was put a side. After a while HedY started bullshitting everyone how lazy they were and why the fuck doesn't anyone have any ideas for a fuckin' song. The bullshitting payed off and the composing of a song has begun, now it' s called "Eternal Cry". Then the other shows came and we did ours. Our most spectacular show was when we played on "Citadela Band Fest". We played only three songs and so did the rest of the bands: Eferemeria, Drugi Svijet, Overdose, ... . And finally we got our chance and played "Eternal Cry", it was a big jump for us. The first official recorded song of our upcoming demo is "A secret for all" then "Diary Of Pain". Hrvoje Glavan (The Producer) has joined our band as a new solo guitarist. Our former solo guitarist File was uninterested of playing metal with us so we checked him out of the band. Thats's all for now, Cheers and STAY DEAD!!
