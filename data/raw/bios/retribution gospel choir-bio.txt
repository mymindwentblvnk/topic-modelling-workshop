Retribution Gospel Choir is an indie rock band based out of Duluth, Minnesota, USA formed in 2007. Current members of the band include, Alan Sparhawk (guitar, vocals, sampler), Steve Garrington (bass), both of whom are also in the band Low, and Eric Pollard (drums, vocals). Despite sharing the majority of their members, RGC's high-energy performance differs greatly from Low's subdued, minimalist feel. Until 2008, Matt Livingston (formerly Low) played bass for the band. Sparhawk's wife Mimi Parker (and also member of Low) appears on vocals on one Retribution Gospel Choir track as well.

Retribution Gospel Choir plays loud and sings in key. Live, two minute pop songs run into psychedelic improvisations and drum-n-bass-heavy dub. People sometimes think the band is too loud or that they should take turns soloing, but generally, people are pleasantly surprised.

Their self-titled debut album Retribution Gospel Choir was released on March 18, 2008 and was produced by Mark Kozelek of Red House Painters and Sun Kil Moon. In 2010 a new album was released simply titled: 2 and promoted with and extensive tour through Europe and the USA.
