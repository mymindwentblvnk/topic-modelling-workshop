Knight Rider was a popular US-American television series that ran between September 26, 1982, and August 8, 1986.

The series was broadcast on NBC and starred David Hasselhoff as Michael Knight, a kind of modern-day "knight" who drove an advanced smart car with artificial intelligence. Conceived and produced by Glen A. Larson, the show was an instant hit and inspired a sub-genre of high-tech crimefighter series. "I want[ed] to do The Lone Ranger with a car," Larson said in The Last Great Ride. "Kind of a sci-fi thing, with the soul of a western." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/KnightRider">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
