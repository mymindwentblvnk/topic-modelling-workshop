4) Crypt is a thrash / death metal / hardcore band from Royston, UK. Crypt at first glance can be seen as one of those good old fashioned metal bands, but then you look deeper and see we have energetic breakdowns and a hell of a lot of things to get in the pit to. We have the classic influences such as Sepultura and Motorhead, but then we have newer influences as well such as Bleeding Through and Caliban. We don't like the same old boring metal song with an overused blast beat or breakdown, we try to write our music so it stands out from most peoples and we think that most of the time it works. We've played with a lot of bands over the past year and a half and every single one has influenced us further, we can only go up from here. Members include Sam Burgess (vocals), Paul Futter (guitars), Adam Smith (guitars), James Dye (bass) and Greg Wilson (drums).
