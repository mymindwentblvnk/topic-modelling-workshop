Black Josh, as he's known to his parents and also non-PC individuals who seek to distinguish him from other Josh's, started out life in Manchester in a cliche tough estate where people do their washing in front of the house on a spinning umbrella style contraption.

He founded the prestigious Ape Cult at a mere 15 years old after standing apart from his peer group while some one else picked numbers. His interests now include string theory, and in particular the age old question: "how long is a piece of one?" He likes to do the raps... He does the raps to new school, old school, 90's-esque boom bap, whatever the backdrop... he does the raps. Josh is currently tragically gripped by a chronic cannabis dependency which he seems to have no intention of battling, so we just let him get on with it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Josh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
