There are three White Wolf bands; 

1) Rock band from the 80's.  Back in 1980, a band was formed in Edmonton Alberta called White Wolf. Many remember White Wolf as a talented, yet underrated Canadian Heavy Metal acts of the 1980’s. In 1984 they signed with RCA and their debut LP “Standing Alone” which went on to sell 250,000 copies worldwide.

The band enjoyed much success and toured North America and were featured on radio stations across the nation as well as Much Music in Canada and MTV in the United States.

In 1985 they flew to Holland to record their second album “Endangered Species” which was released in 1986. The album was sitting at #114 on the Billboard charts, heading to break 100 when their record label RCA was purchased by BMG.

Sensing a lack of support after the record company merger, the band went their separate ways in 1988.

With the rise in popularity of 80’s music this decade, White Wolf resurfaced in 2007 with former members Don Wilk and Cam Macleod reuniting to release their third album “Victim of the Spotlight”. Wilk has since changed his legal name to “Don Wolf” and he and Macleod have been touring Europe to promote their new album.

The band has recently re-issued a double digipack of their first two albums “Standing Alone” and “Endangered Species” and are selling their live in Germany performance on their MySpace

They were the former Bobby Bradford Blues Band which played in Nashville in the late '70's.  It was so named because a fan once thought Bobby sounded like a white "Howling Wolf".  -q <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/White+Wolf">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
