Based in Washington, EEUU. "Born in Olympia, at the age of one, moved to detroit. Grew up in Detroit, and East Chicago, IN, Gary, IN. For some odd reason, was drawn right back to the west coast. Some say it was the women, some say it was music, some say it was the weed.....I say it was all three....mostly the music though. Now I reside in Oly where I constantly grind and make music that i believe will someday cause a remarkable change." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Xperience">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
