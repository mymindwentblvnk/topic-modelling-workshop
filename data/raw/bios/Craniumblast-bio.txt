Craniumblast is a dark metal band from Finland and hails from the town called Heinola. It was formed in February 2007. 

The band underwent a slight change in the line up in November 2009 after the lead guitarist Henkka announced his departure from the band. Fortunately the empty slot was soon covered when Leevi (from ARF) took over the duties.

Undoubtedly the highlight of the band so far is the upcoming Christmas Metal Meeting Tour 2009 starting December 2nd in which Craniumblast performs as a support act.

At the end of the year 2011 Craniumblast started recording their first full-length album. The band returns to the original lineup when founder member Henkka Himself comes back to the band. Due to the Henkka's come back Leevi leaves the band.  Later during the recording sessions vocalist Pete left the band and Jimmy "Grey" Salmi took over singing duties and Craniumblast got a new killer sound. 

Craniumblast's debut album entitled "Singularity" saw daylight in march, 2014.
