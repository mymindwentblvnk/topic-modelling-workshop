Anakim are a progressive death metal band from Dorset, UK. Founded in the summer of 2011, Anakim have been writing material ever since, and are currently recording their debut album, ‘Monuments to Departed Worlds’. Heavy, rhythmical riffs, melodic layers and daring song structures have become the signature of Anakim's sound. Their lyrical themes are epic and diverse; ancient Mesopotamian mythologies merge with modern science fiction fantasy to sculpt a truly grandiose atmosphere. 
Having written the guitar parts and initial drum ideas, lead guitarist, Joe Ryan later collaborated with guitarist, Carl Hunting and Trifixion drummer, Ewan Ross, to piece together and complete the debut album. They recorded the drums in their home town of Weymouth in 2014, and the guitars later that year. With the lyrics written, the quest for a vocalist - and bassist - began.
In 2015, Anakim proudly announced Geoff Bradley, of brutal death metal act Atonement, as their full time vocalist. They collaborated to put the lyrics to the music, and vocal recording commenced soon after.
After searching high and low for a full time bassist, Anakim welcomed the legendary Ant Ridout of Bloodshot Dawn in early 2016. With a date now set to record the bass, completion of the album is perceivably close.
