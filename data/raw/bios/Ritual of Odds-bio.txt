RITUAL OF ODDS came into existence in 2003 as EXISTENCE EDGE, but in 2005 changed the name to RITUAL OF ODDS and they started to work on their demo titled ‘Building up the Underverse’. In 2008, the band played these new songs live on stage for the first time, and received great reviews. This encouraged them to record their debut full length album ‘Underverse’, which was released in early 2010. Never stopping work on their sound, at the end of that same year, the band recorded their 2nd full length album ‘God is an Atheist’, and promoted it’s release with several live shows in Europe, during which RITUAL OF ODDS shared the stage with worldwide acts such as OMEN (USA), PAUL DI'ANNO (UK), SEPTIC FLESH (GR) and NIGHTRAGE (SW). RITUAL OF ODDS has had very successful tours in both Europe and in the United States. The band is often described as Melodic Death Metal, but there is so, so much more involved with their music. They have brought together all their personal influences to create a very unique sound by infusing elements of T hrash, H orror and E pic metal into their style of melodic death. RITUAL OF ODDS is truly THE band to watch for on the metal horizon. Axis of Metal (Canada) even dubbed RITUAL OF ODDS the “Melodic Death Metal Masters of Greece”.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ritual+of+Odds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
