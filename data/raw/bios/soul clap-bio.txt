By harnessing the past Soul Clap looks to the future and plays a seminal role for Boston dance music. They perform simultaneously with 4 turntables and 2 mixers, as well as with percussionists, saxophonists and sometimes with full bands of live musicians. They organize parties with DJs like Carl Craig, King Britt, Josh Wink, Questlove, J-Boogie, Alix Alvarez and The Rub. They bring their cosmic vision to earth with original production, record custom mixes for FILA, Intercontinental Hotel Group and Nanette Lepore, as well as produce The Adventures of Soul Clap Podcast (available on iTunes). Always pushing new boundaries, always traveling time and space, Soul Clap is the Great White Hope. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Clap">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
