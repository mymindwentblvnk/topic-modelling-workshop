Dead Syndicate has been crushing the Northern Virginia metal scene, and has risen to become the area’s premiere death metal band. Based out of Manassas, Virginia, Dead Syndicate has shared the stage with such influential death metal and thrash acts as: Morbid Angel, Sepultura, Behemoth, Napalm Death, Obituary, Kreator, and many many more. By first cutting their teeth on several local shows, and then clawing their way up the food chain with progressively larger shows supporting national acts, Dead Syndicate finally broke out on the National stage by landing one of the extremely coveted Emperor reunion shows. In July of 2006, Dead Syndicate travelled to New York City to open for one of only four U.S. Emperor concerts. That an unsigned out of town band could land such an exclusive gig became national news, and the internet buzz surrounding the show put the band on the map.

Following the highly successful trip to New York, Dead Syndicate inked a deal with Black Morning Star Records and began work on their debut album, “The Carrion Creed.” The Carrion Creed was recorded at Nightsky Studios in November 2006 with engineer Ron Vento, and the album was produced by drummer Michael Arcane. The Carrion Creed will be released on January 13th, 2007.
