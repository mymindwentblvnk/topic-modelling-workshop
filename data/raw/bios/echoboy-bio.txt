Echoboy was conceived in 1998 when Richard Warren's band The Hybirds split and he released the ferocious 'Flashlegs' 12" under the name Echoboy.

He signed to Mute and delivered the genre defying album volume one exactly one year after signing the deal. Just six months later his second album volume two arrived. Two and a half years later and the 3rd album giraffe was unleashed.

Since then, Noel Gallagher chased after Rich to join Oasis and countless others pursued him to join their bands or remix their records. 

In 2007, Echoboy returned with the leftfield electronic work elektrik soul psymphonie.
