Keita Sano is a young producer from Okayama, Japan. This guy got skills fellows, and this is not just our opinion. His productions are full of heart, hardihood and culture. Its so cool to hear to his music, because his vision is wide and deep and his taste established and personal even if Keita is 23 yo and able to move among different styles, from hip-hop to house, from disco to electronica. Just image him as a soundtrack producer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Keita+Sano">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
