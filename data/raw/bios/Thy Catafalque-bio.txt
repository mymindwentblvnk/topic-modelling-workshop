Thy Catafalque were born in 1998 in a small town of Hungary playing traditional, epic black metal in the beginning by tamás kátai (Gire) and János Juhász. Just after their first and only demo KaOtic Productions decided to release their first album in 1999 entitled Sublunary Tragedies, followed by the second record Microcosmos in 2001.

Throughout the passing years the music became more and more experimental with deep touches of electronic and folklorish influences feeding from their homeland in Central Europe. Meanwhile KaOtic Productions ceased to exist, so the third album Tűnő Idő Tárlat (An Exhibition of Vanishing Time) came to sunlight as a self-financed production in 2004. By this time lyrics turned into Hungarian and music turned out to be the most diverse and atmospheric experimentum coming out from the band. Cosmic music from micro to macro, from matter to spirit and then back into the ashes.

This world is about to be painted by more vivid colours in the latest release entitled Róka Hasa Rádió released by Epidemie Records on the 12th of May, 2009 and in November 2009 by Soyuz Music. The main concept behind the album is the relationship between the ever evolving, solid and massive physical matter and the fragileness of human and all living spirits throughout distant childhood memories and scientific explanations of nature. Revolving, rotating movements of past and future, colours, sounds, long lost scents by a strange transmission from a timeless radio. 

After the very well appreciated Róka Hasa Rádió album, in 2010 Epidemie Records decided to print a re-issue of previous recording of Thy Catafalque entitled  Tűnő Idő Tárlat. It was originally released by the band itself in 2004 in a very small scale. Limited to 500 pieces of beautful digipak, the music is untouched while the artwork is renewed. 

In 2011 Thy Catafalque signed to  Season Of Mist. The fifth album entitled Rengeteg was released on 11 November 2011 in Europe and 10 January 2012 in North-America. All the instruments have been reccorded by Tamás Kátai alone this time, as János Juhász left the band in 2011. Guest musicians: Attila Bakos (Woodland Choir, Taranis) - all clean male vocals, Ágnes Tóth (The Moon And The Nightspirit) - female vocals, Mihály Simkó-Várnagy - cello.

In October, 2015 Season Of Mist releases the band's sixth album, Sgùrr in vinyl and 36-page digibook CD.

In November, 2015 Blood Music re-releases Cor Cordium (Demo), Sublunary Tragedies and Microcosmos as The Early Works in 3xCD and limited vinyl box-set edition.
