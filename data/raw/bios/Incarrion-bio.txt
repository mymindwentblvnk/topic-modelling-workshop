Along the lines of a faster Incantation or Immolation, Incarrion present their adequate style of death metal, although somewhat different then the gore-splatter sickness expected from a United Guttural recording. While the style is really not too off the mark from the label's roster, the fact that Incarrion incorporate more thought into their lyrics, with a presumed Lovecraftian influence, helps tremendously. This fact in and of itself manages to separate them specifically away from the gore and sickness aesthetics of the label's roster, giving both the artist and the label further credibility for expansion. Incarrion still manage to present their own take on the brutal death metal style, able to compete with any of the heavier hitters of the United Guttural roster, and for that matter, the majority of extreme underground death metal acts who chose to play the more American style of absolute brutality just for the sake of it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Incarrion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
