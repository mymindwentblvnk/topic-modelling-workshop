The band was formed in 2008,
we had a lot of bands that inspired homage to hardcore music, metal, technical metal and death metal, we try to unify all of that inspiration into one of the music that we play the music loud and a bit of the beat and followed by the stage action is attractive and Energic, we are happy to make people enjoy our music,
And besides that we also learned a lot about life, death, social life and crime that also inspired the music and our songs.
we tried to explore the problems that occur in life is to create music and we remain confident in who we play music and stay on track with the music we want.
We hope you all love, appreciate and support us in music, and we will keep trying to be the best for you ... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/second+before">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
