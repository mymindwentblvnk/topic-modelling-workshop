There are 2 bands with this name.

1) Hailing from Canada, and another mainstay in mid to late-nineties hardcore. They challenged and re-invented themselves with every record, sparse as their output was, at the same time peppering many of their songs with sometimes-controversial political messages. But whether you agree or disagree with the content, much of it has lost none of its current relevance and the music itself has stood the test of time.

2) A band formed late 2008 from the ashes of pioneers of Australian hardcore, Mindsnare. Featuring members of Mindsnare, Samsara, Hitlist, Within Blood, Blood Duster, Meatlocker and more.
