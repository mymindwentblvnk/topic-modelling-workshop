1.Ade formed in Caput Mundi, Italy in 2007 by Messor (guitars) and  recruits Claudio (drums) and later Flavio (Vocals).  Inspired by the Ancient Roman Empire and fusing with modern and very impactive death metal with lyrics written in English and ancient Latin language, ADE's goal is to bring the listener right into the Coliseum! One demo has been recorded called "Ultima Ratio". The latest release was a full-length album in 2009, "Prooemivm Sangvine".

3. “Ade is an innovative singer/songwriter and producer based in New York City. A potent mix of technological advancement and eclectic influence have nurtured his confidently abstract approach to production and lyricism. Extracting from the esoteric with a cut-and-paste like approach, Ade cites eclectic references from Bjork to Backstreet Boys, with his own innovative creations straddling just about everything in-between.” -Posted by Ade, Spotify <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ade">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
