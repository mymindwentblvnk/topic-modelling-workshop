Cloudchord specializes in augmenting musical possibility. Derek VanScoten is the producer, guitarist and Emmy-winning musician behind Cloudchord. His remarkable technical skills on the guitar give a refreshing take on atmospheric dance music, solidifying Cloudchord’s place in the world of psychedelic chillhop beats.

For those who enjoy the ethereal sounds of Bonobo, the basslines of FKJ, & slick neo guitar strums, Cloudchord curates a vibe of something yet untouched. His recent works, “Refresh” and “Attunement,” transport you to a New York City rooftop, where grooves and sunshine wrap around you in the midst of a hazy summer. "Reverence" is Cloudchord’s new album of acoustic beats, out May 15, 2020. The record’s intention is to reset & cleanse the palette of Cloudchord’s fans. He pairs his breezy steel string guitars & ukuleles alongside a diverse set of collaborators. The album naturally adopts an easy, meditative tone as fans of lo-fi, instrumentals, funk & jazz take a pleasant journey through each track.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cloudchord">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
