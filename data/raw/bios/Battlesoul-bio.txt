Battlesoul was founded in the Fall of 2007 by guitarist Mike Grund (ex-Heaven Ablaze) and drummer Nich Ireland (ex-Distrotl). After several rehearsals they began to audition bass players and finally came across Jon Doyle (ex-O' Faolain) who as an added bonus brought vocals and keyboards to the mix. They began to practice to only find they were missing the last piece of the puzzle, a lead guitarist. After unsuccessfully auditioning several guitarists it dawned on them that Nich's older brother Thomas Ireland (ex-Perish/Blind Eye Era) would be a perfect fit. Moments later a call was made and it became official.

Battlesoul continues to perfect their unique brand of hyper thrash fused with melodies from various celtic instruments while playing shows throughout Ontario. A self titled EP of 5 songs was released in 2008. Their first full length album entitled "Lay Down Thy Burdens", a concept album based on the bloody war between the Romans and the Celts was released in 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Battlesoul">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
