   Amession was formed around 2000/2001 and original lineup was:
   Aleksi Haahtela (drums)
   Toni Helaakoski (guitars, backing vocals)
   Sami Pöntynen (guitars, vocals)

   Later in 2001 they recruited Tommi Jaakkola (Bass) and first demo called Frozen Grave was recorded. In 2002 Amession got a dedicated vocalist known as Sir Gary and second demo was released. The 2003 demo called Heart Of Darkness experimented with female vocals and band started to get local gigs.

   In 2004 released Fuck The Authority, Rape The System! was sort of an turning point for a band since it was pure thrash instead of melodic and athmospheric metal. It was also a turning point in terms of Sami leaving the band.

   In 2005 Amession got a new guitarist Marko Niutanen and new vocalist Kai Saxholm to record Redemption: No Way Out which turned out to be the key record. Song Obsession won Song Of The Month voting for December 2005 at www.noise.fi and was also released on Miasma metal magazines cd.

   2006 started out with Tommi, Gary and Marko leaving the band but instead of that being a drawback Amession functioned better than ever and started recording their 6th cd. This one was named Thorns Within and 5 song cd had also a music video of track Silence as a bonus.
