Paranorm was first thought of as Markus Hiltunen (guitars, vocals), Fredrik Kjellgren (guitars) and Marcus Blom (bass) met in high school, sharing similar musical interests. After recruiting Karl Askebro (drums), they started composing and rehearsing their first originals. Extensive gigging followed in early 2010, and by May the same year they started recording a debut demo, which was released July 27.

Inspired by Bay Area and European thrash metal along with the NWOBHM movement, they set out to create a technical and melodic form of thrash metal, without losing the intensity of the old school sound.

Their goal is to expand upon the new wave of thrash metal while finding their own niche within the genre, thus leaving a mark on the realm of heavy metal.

"Demo 2010", Paranormâ€™s first recording, was released on July 27th and contains 5 of their first tracks. The demo can be downloaded for free or streamed via MySpace.
