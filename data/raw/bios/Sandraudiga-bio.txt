It all started in North Carolina, back in the summer of 2005. Trevor Rodgers met Dan Hamilton, and they played in a band called Arcain Emperium. The very next year, 2006, Dan and Trevor formed a studio project, outside of Arcain Emperium, called "Left for Dead", and began fine tuning their sound. After a lot of bad noise and crazy circumstances, Trevor moved to Pennsylvania in the summer of 2007. While Dan was tying up lose ends and preparing to follow his friend into battle, Trevor began to network and meet new people. Kontryte was formed shortly after.

The fall of 2007 came quickly, and Dan finally made it to PA, to complete the the five piece known as Kontryte. They had Evan Wilt on guitar, Brandon Doyle, also on guitar, Erick Occasio on bass, Trevor Rodgers on drums and Dan Hamilton on the mic. Searching ever still, for their sound, Dan and Trevor had the idea to add a keyboard to the mix, believing that it would add depth and mystery to their music. Enter... Katie Jewell.

In the summer of 2009, after a good run, musical differences cause Kontryte to split, leaving Dan on vocals, Katie on the keyboard, Erick Occasio on bass and Trevor, who switched to guitar. They met up with Nic Gochenaur, who interduced them to the drummer, Dan Tonzola in August and the band became known as The Hollow.

Dan played drums for a while, before he had to take a short 8 month leave for personal reasons. Nick Lower filled in for Dan T. nicely. He played several shows with The Hollow, and during his reign as the new drummer, the band was forced to choose a different, more suiting name. After a month or so of deliberating, they finally settled on Sandraudiga. Dan T. came back to the band with a clear head and releaved Nick Lower, to reclaim his throne behind the drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sandraudiga">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
