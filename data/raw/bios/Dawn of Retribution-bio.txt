Hailing from the coastal town of Geelong in Australia, Dawn of Retribution utilise many styles of extreme music to deliver one uncompromising aural experience. Coupled with a crushing live performance, the band has worked hard since their inception in 2007 to earn a respected reputation in Australia's metal scene.

After tearing apart a years worth of audiences and winning the praise of both their industry peers and music fans through original compositions, a furious live show and seamless execution, it was time Dawn of Retribution began to consider a studio recording. The band decided not to mess about with unimpressive EP releases and to jump straight into a full length album for their debut. 'The Plan to End Humanity' was the result.

The album tells a story of the struggles of mankind, the end of existence itself and the repercussions of humanity's sins. Musically, this album is the perfect representation of Dawn of Retribution. A raw yet polished sound delivers the band's full musical spectrum, from blistering metal to chilling melodies. 

'The Plan To End Humanity' has been something special from day one, and features the work of industry stalwarts such as Will Blackmon of Swedish grind band Gadget, Joe Haley of Australia's own Psycroptic and the designs of Thomas Ewerhard who has worked with Hypocrisy and Amon Amarth among many others. 'The Plan To End Humanity' is an album that is sure to etch its mark in the Australian metal timeline. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DAWN+OF+RETRIBUTION">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
