Carlina is a singer songwriter from East London. She is a classically trained pianist that rebelled and branched out into acoustic and electrix guitar. But she does occasionally write songs on the keys after warming up on Bach and Chopin. She wishes she coudl play like Eric Clapton and /or Dior and wishes she could sing like Sheryl Crow and / or Joni Mitchell. 
Everything you hear on her myspace (www.myspace.com/carlinawa1ton) has been composed, written, arranged, performed and sung by Carlina in a flat somewhere in London using a Zoom MRS 4 track a dodgy mic and headphones that decide when theyâ€™re prepared to work and when not. 
As for sound production, some songs on here that sound good were mixed by Chris Amblin and the others that sounds downright dodgy / out of tune etc were not mixed at all, just wav files from my 4 track converted into mp3 files! 
She loves gigging and is organising a UK tour this year plus a random stint in Bogota in June!.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carlina">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
