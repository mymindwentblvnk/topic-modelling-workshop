There is more than one artist with this name:

1. Drom was founded in the beginning of 2010 by four friends born in Liberec, Czech Republic, involved in different bands of different styles. Connected by passion and need to put emotions and feelings in the music, they started Drom - dark hardcore band with shoegaze and post-rock elements (the name is derived from Stanley Kubrick's movie Shining. It means "Redrum" in Czech).

The band quickly started with writing first album and gigging. In three years, they made three releases (two full albums, one split), and played more than a hundred gigs in different countries, including Asymmetry,  Fluff Fest and many various beneficial events (mainly GNWP and antiracist activities). Despite increasing popularity and the fact, they do not fit in hardcore genre boundaries, they still feel tightly connected to underground and hardcore scene.

Drom's music varies from quiet post-rock parts to massive guitar walls full of emotions, with little of screaming vocals and is definitely must hear for fans of Amenra, Year of No Light, Russian Circles and other similar bands.
