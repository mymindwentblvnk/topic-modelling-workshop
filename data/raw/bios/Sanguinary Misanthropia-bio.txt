SANGUINARY MISANTHROPIA is a warlike Black Metal cult from Melbourne, Australia. SANGUINARY MISANTHROPIA creates ritualistic Devil’s music, with lyrical themes delving into Diabolic Gnosticism, Chaos, Synchronicity, Death, and Blood Mysticism. Whilst sounding like quintessentially Australian blackened war metal, whorls of dissonant and chaotic guitars, unholy war metal drumming and acerbic blacked-death metal vocals distinguish their sinister musical compositions. The band’s illustrious debut ‘LOATHE OVER WILL’, was released in 2012 by Supremacy Through Intolerance to much critical exultation and praise. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sanguinary+Misanthropia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
