There are multiple artists called Winterland, including a goth band from New Zealand, a power metal band from France (later renamed Silent Fall), and a progressive metal/hard rock band from Germany.

1. Winterland are a New Zealand goth band that were formed in 1995 by John Mason (guitars/vocals) and Michael Caulfield (keyboards/programming). They were joined by Barry Morton (bass), Ross Harris (guitar), and Glyn Beaumont (drums). In 1998, these additional members left the band, though not before the recording of the Ceremony EP. By late 1999, the Winterland line-up had been rebuilt with the addition of Robyn Sutherland (bass), Dave Carroll (drums) and Andrew Buckton (guitars). In early 2000, Carroll was replaced on drums by Mark Queenin, whilst in live situations, guitar was played by Michel of Disjecta Membra instead of Buckton. The new Winterland line-up of Mason, Caulfield, Queenin, Sutherland and Michel Rowland made their live debut at the Vampyre Ball in Auckland in August 2000, and completed the recording of their debut album Alone In A Fairground near the end of the same year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Winterland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
