Majestic Vanguard is a Swedish Christian melodic heavy/power metal band from a town called Falköping. Originaly the band was called Divine Disciples. In the beginning of the 90's the line-up was the following Andreas Andersson - Bass and his brother Samuel Andersson - Guitar, Daniel Eskilsson - drums and John Lönnmyr - keyboard. Between 1993 and 1995 they released 2 demos and made a few gigs before John Lönnmyr left the band in the fall of 1995. A few years later Daniel, Samuel and Andreas met once again in Falköping, and they decided to give metal another chance. At first they played basically with a bas, one guitar and drums. But they started to experiment with two guitars and one guitar and one keyboard. It was a rough time to survive and it could pas months between rehearsals mainly because all of the members got married during that time, and Samuel Andersson changed his name to Samuel Fredén. Until 2003 the band had no singer, but in spring they decided to give the singer Peter Sigfridsson a chance, which turned out perfectly. In 2004 the band released another demo and that demo gave them a contract with “Rivel records”. In September 2004 the band recruited a new member, Johan Abelson on the guitar. At this point they changed their name to "Majestic Vanguard". The line-up was, 
Peter Sigfridsson - Vocals
Johan Abelson - Guitar
Samuel Fredén - Keyboard
Daniel Eskilsson - Drums
Andreas Andersson - Bass
In 2005 the band released their debut album “Beyond the Moon” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Majestic+Vanguard">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
