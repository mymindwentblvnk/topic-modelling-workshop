Phillipp Friedrich Silcher (27 June 1789 in Schnait (today part of Weinstadt)  – 26 August 1860 in Tübingen), was a German composer, mainly known for his lieder (songs), and an important folksong collector.

Silcher was meant to be a school teacher, but dedicated himself entirely to music in the seminary in Ludwigsburg after he met Carl Maria von Weber. He was taught composition and piano by Conradin Kreutzer and Johann Nepomuk Hummel. In 1817 he was named musical director at the University of Tübingen. He is regarded as one of the most important protagonists of choir singing. He arranged many German and international folk songs that even today remain standard repertoire of many choirs in Germany and became an integral part of German daily life. In 1829 Silcher founded the "Akademische Liedertafel" in Tübingen and directed it until his death.

He was married to Luise Rosine Ensslin (6 September 1804 in Tübingen – 17 June 1871 ibid.). They had two daughters and one son.

A wine varietal was named after him, the Silcher (not to be confused with Schilcher). The asteroid 10055 Silcher also bears the composer's name. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Friedrich+Silcher">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
