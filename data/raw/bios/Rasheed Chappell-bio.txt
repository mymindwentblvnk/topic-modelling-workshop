Rasheed Chappell is truly an exception to the current rule of click’s and cliche’s.  Rasheed is an artist whose music is a sonic backdrop to life as he sees it, lives it and dreams it.  Rasheed’s gift is only second to his tireless work ethic and his constant pursuit of elevation, to push himself and the genre to new heights and dimensions.

He is the child of an era when Hip-Hop Legends such as Rakim, Big Daddy Kane and Slick Rick were considered prophets among men by their command of the English language on the microphone.

Rasheed’s words are able to capture and convey cinematic emotion, it’s as if you are watching a movie more than listening to music.  He has the ability to weaves tales of tragedy and triumph into soulful melodies that reflect his environment and love of Hip-Hop culture. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rasheed+Chappell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
