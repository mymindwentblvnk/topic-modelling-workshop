In 2008, a collaboration between M. Halsberghe (ex LIAR) & K. Mondy (ex AMEN RA) resulted in the recording of 2 demo's & the release of a split 12" with the French screamo-act ALCESTE.
Following these releases, the idea of performing the songs live started taking concrete form. 
With B. Guillemont claiming the drumseat & F. Maelbrancke handling second guitars & samples, the project transformed in a band.
In 2011, a remix and remaster of demos I & II was released on US-based Init Records. This compilation also contained 2 newly recorded songs. A 3rd song was released on a split 10" vinyl with AMEN-RA.

Around 2013, after a relativly long period of inactivity, B. Vandekendeleire replaced K. Mondy on the bassguitar & the recording of a new album started. This DIY project is nearing completion and should see daylight somewhere in 2014.
