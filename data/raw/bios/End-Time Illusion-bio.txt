End-Time Illusion is a punishing Metal band out of central CT. E-TI is driven to perform sick sets filled with killer riffs, searing solos, and mass head banging. The E-TI sound encompasses thrash, grind, death, and speed laced with harmonies, breakdowns, and obscure scales. E-TIâ€™s mission is to be a driving force in the resurgence of true metal. To this end we will play anywhere at any time. The first two tracks posted are from our new release "Eminent Profane" and three are off our 2005 release "So Below". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/End-Time+Illusion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
