Simian were an English band, who started out making folky electro but are better known for their electro-pop songs, especially "La Breeze", which was featured in a Peugeot 1007 commercial. Their second album "We Are Your Friends" was produced by the legendary Brian Eno.

The band split up in 2005 with James Ford and Shaw forming the splinter group Simian Mobile Disco. The new group is more dance oriented and are in demand as remixers and Djs. In 2006, "We Are Your Friends", a remix of their song "Never Be Alone" was released on a reactivated Virgin label called Ten Records. This single was credited to "Justice vs. Simian" and started life as a submission by the French electro outfit Justice in a remix competition. The video for the single controversially won the award for best video at the MTV Europe video Awards 2006, and fellow nominee Kanye West appeared on stage to complain at their victory, claiming that the prize should have gone to him. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Simian">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
