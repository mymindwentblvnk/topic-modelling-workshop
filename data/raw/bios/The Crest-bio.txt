The Crest (Norway)

A band from oslo, playing female fronted gothic rock with catchy melodies, massive guitars and a soothing female voice. They were formed in 1996 by Nell and Kristian Sigland. After some name and line-up changes the band decided on the name "THE CREST" in 1999, after recording their second demo. From this time the band developed their own, characteristic sound.

In 2001 The Crest recorded their first release, "Letters from Fire", in France, together with Terje Refsnes (producer of Tristania, Carpathian Forest, The Sins of thy Beloved).

In 2003 the band decided to take a sabbatical to regain time and energy to record their next album. Nell and Kristian dedicated some time for side project named "Rustflower Incorporated", experimenting with electronic music. 
Furthermore, Nell succeed to the crown of Theatre of Tragedy's fired vocalist Liv Kristine.

In 2004 The Crest reunited and recorded their second album, "Vain City Chronicles" at the Top Room Studio in Norway.
"Vain City Chronicles" shows, according to the band, "a heavier, more guitar-based side of the band, while still focusing on the characteristic melancholic melodies and of course Nell's soothing voice."

In October 2010, Nell and Kristian stated that The Crest has split up to enable other projects.

Line Up:
Nell Sigland - vocals
Kristian Sigland - guitars, programming
Stian Aarebrot - guitars
Klaus Blomvik - drums
Magnus Westgaard - bass guitar
