Svartby is a folk metal band from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. 

The band sings about wild magical creatures living in fictional place "Svartby" (Black Village) - witches, goblins, dwarfs - definitely unkind to human folk, but at the same time merry, nature-loving and nice living beings with a good sense of humor. The lyrics are in Swedish. 

The lyrics of the debut album were heavily criticized by Swedish listeners (even the name "Kom I Min Kittel"  became "cum in my cauldron" in Swedish ears, not "come into my cauldron"as the band meant). So, to avoid misunderstanding and possible grammar mistakes, the band asked their Swedish friends to check lyrics for further releases ("Tomte" EP and second full length "Riv, Hugg och Bit").

Line-up:

Torhall – vocals, bass
Lindwurm – guitars
Giftsvamp – keyboards, lyrics
Fenrir – drums

Ex-members:
Hemskalf – guitars, clean vocals (2004-2005)
Hök - guitars (2005-2009)
Somna - drums (2004-2009)
