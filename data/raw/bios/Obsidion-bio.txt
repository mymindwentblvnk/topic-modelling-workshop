Obsidion draw influence from a wide range of genres, from classical, ambient and various forms of metal and prog rock, focusing more on melody instead of sheer brutality to create their own distinct form of Progressive Metal. They released a self titled demo in 2006 to great reviews, borninblood.co.uk calling them “Some of the finest talent the Emerald Isle has produced in a very long time” and are planning to release an E.P. in the new year.
