1. Russian band
Blackthorn —  symphonic black gothic metal band from Moscow, Russia, fully and beautifully female-completed.

Aina, Stray Away Cantatrice — soprano/scream
Elvira, Six String Alchemida — guitars, growl, music, keys/samples
Greta, Adust Anomic Suicide — bass
Varaska, Mortiferous Winter Blastphemy — drums
