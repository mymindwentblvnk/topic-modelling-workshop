substAnce D was formed in Los Angeles in 1992. Then known as Black, their self-titled debut was released in Europe in 1994. Black was a two year record in the making. Guitarist Michael Parnin daylights as a sound engineer who has worked with such bands as Marilyn Manson, Limp Bizkit and Coal Chamber. So Parnin would stay late at work, wait until everyone else left and then invite the rest of the guys to whatever studio he was working at to record. Most of Black was done at about 3 am in the morning on someone else's booked studio time. Originally thought of as just some rough demos, it was these recordings that got released in Europe and eventually put out by FAD/Century Media records in late 1998 as Black under the new band name substAnce D. FAD quietly released the album, to get the name out and had them tour with label mates, Pissing Razors. Afterwards, they got them in the studio (legitimately) to work on a new album. The result was the critically successful sophmore album titled "Addictions", which received the tag from hit parader magazine "possibly the best metal album of 1999". After performing with the likes of Slayer, Morbid Angel, Downset, Danzig, and Biohazard, substAnce D decided to disband in 2001.
