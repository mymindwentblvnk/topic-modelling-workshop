There are several bands using this name

1) Formed in 2008, Silver Machine hail from Asheville, North Carolina (USA) and play a blend of "cosmic funk, space rock or psychedelic trance rock"- whatever you want to call it, Silver Machine mixes tight funky grooves with wild experimentation. Featuring a theremin (a retro-futuristic electronic instrument from the 1920's), Silver Machine has a spooky, far-out sound a lot like the old Science Fiction and Horror film soundtracks from the past. The band has a sound all of its own, while influenced by classic bands like Pink Floyd, and newer bands like Sound Tribe Sector Nine and Ozric Tentacles.

Silver Machine had gained a lot of momentum in Asheville, having played the Orange Peel for The Bob Moog Foundation's "Mooged-Out" show featuring many of Asheville's most talented performers, as well as features on URTV channel 20, WNCW 88.7FM, the River 98.1FM, and club and festival appearances throughout the Southeast both as a headliner and in support of such acts as Boombox, Pnuma Trio, and the Malah.  Silver Machine's eponymous debut album was released in 2009, after which the band began construction on a giant spaceship from which they will release all future recordings.  In June of 2011, following their performance at the Orange Peel, the band launched  into outer space.  Their current whereabouts are unknown, but their next album will be beamed back to earth sometime in the year 2012A.D.
