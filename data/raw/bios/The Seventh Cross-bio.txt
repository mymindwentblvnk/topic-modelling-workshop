The Seventh Cross was founded in the summer of 2004. A bunch of dudes not particularly happy with their current bands grouped together and wrote a bunch of kick-ass metal tunes. Taking inspiration from Tolkien, Slayer, and all things heavy metal, they sought to craft a band based on music and integrity rather than on shitty haircuts and tight jeans.

Two years down the line have seen a few line up changes, a debut album released then rereleased, recording contracts signed, countless gigs played (and annihilated), and a few tours under their belt. But the band's central principles remain the same:

Heavy.

Fucking.

Metal.

No bullshit Tony & Guy haircuts. No tight jeans. No style over substance. No rock star bullshit. Just the music.

In a scene where all it takes for a band to suceed is a few days of adding friends on myspace The Seventh Cross aim to stand apart from many of their contemporaries. Their emphasis will always be on the music, the lyrics and the most ferocious live show as they are capable of.

The second full length is already in the works and promises to FUCKING SHRED. Just you wait and see.

Until then, we'll see you in the pit.
