Music album draws the listener to unresolved internal conflicts, to the back of the mirror every one of us, to the point of no return, which comes after the betrayal of a loved one, to the origins of the Eternal Unforgiven, able to permanently change the present.

Mixing the album was well-known Chilean musician and sound engineer Juan Escobar. Mirror Morionis debut will be released in early fall.
