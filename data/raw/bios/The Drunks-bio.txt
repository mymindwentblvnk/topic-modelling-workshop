Your typical garage streetpunk/Oi! band that looks more like a bunch of psychobilly guys. They started in 1998 as one of the few "skinheadbands" in the little town of Manchester, New Hampshire. The band consisted of Al on vocals, George and Christian on guitars (though Christian left the band after this release), Evan on bass and Denis on drums. They released this EP in 2000 and later changed their name to The dark alley drunks and released a 7'' on DSS records in 2002. After that the band broke up and to my knowledge none of the members went on to play in any other bands. One of them now does service in Iraq but thats basicly all i know. They where proud members of the skinheadcrew Manchester Firm. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Drunks">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
