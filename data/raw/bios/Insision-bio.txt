Insision is a Swedish brutal death metal band with a non-Swedish sound. The band formed in Stockholm, Sweden in 1997. Drawing inspirations from Cryptopsy, Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse and Deicide, the group is better associated with death metal from North America.

They have released three full lengths, "Beneath The Folds of Flesh" (2002), "Revealed and Worshipped" (2004) and "Ikon" (2007). Beside those they have released 3 demos titled "Meant to Suffer" (1997), "Promo 2000" (2000) and "Revelation of the SadoGod" (2001). They did a split with Inveracity called "Revelation of the SadoGod" in 2001. The Insision part is also the aforementioned "Revelation of the SadoGod" demo.

After dealing with a few line-up changes (Toob Brynedahl and Thomas Daun both left the band for personal reasons and Marcus Johannson has joined the band as drummer) Insision have recorded their new album in November 2006. The new album will be named "Ikon". Insision was dropped from its previous label Earache Records in April 2006 as the label was having financial difficulties.

In May, Insision found a second guitar player in the form of Magnus. He however does not appear on IKON, the third full-length album of Insision.

After some distribution problems, IKON was released on September 26, 2007.

It was announced on May 12 2009 that Daniel Ekeroth has left the band due to his writing and publishing schedule. He has written amongst other books the famous 'Swedish Death Metal'.
