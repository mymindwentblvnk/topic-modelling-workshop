Puce Mary is the solo project of Copenhagen-based experimental musician Frederikke Hoffmeier. Closely affiliated with the punk scene that grew out of the danish capital and spawned labels like Posh Isolation and bands like Iceage, VÃ¥r and Lust for Youth, Hoffmeier has chosen a somewhat different path.
As a solo project, Puce Mary is constantly evolving and never stays in the same place for very long. Where the early tapes and records on danish label Posh Isolation have been minimal with a dark edge, Hoffmeier has recently showcased her diversity through live performances and collaborations.
