Itâ€™s no coincidence that Canadian/Swedish musician and producer Owen Meyers chose the name Bruce Brus as his alias. "Brus" comes from the Swedish word for "noise", so with specialties in ambient noise meditation, sleep aid, and concentration tools, the name seemed befitting. Through the use of ambient, non rhythmic drones and nature sounds, Owen has created a unique soundscape with a massive impact. As a classically trained musician with extensive performance experience, Owen felt ready to explore new musical horizons and only recently began to pursue production, professionally. The endeavour proved so successful that in addition to having amassed a sizeable audience, his track "White Noise Crashing Waves" has surpassed 100 million streams on Spotify. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Brus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
