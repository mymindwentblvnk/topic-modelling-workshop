Kill Devil Hill is a Heavy Metal supergroup from USA formed in 2011 around the talents of drummer Vinny Appice (Black Sabbath, Heaven & Hell, Dio),  bassist Rex Brown (Pantera and Down), guitarist Mark Zavon (ex-W.A.S.P.) and lead vocalist Dewey Bragg (Pissing Razors). The band is named for a North Carolina coastal town with a long history of piracy (as in rum, swordplay, and loot), mine both the past and present, resulting in a powerful blend of groove-laden hard rock, brooding grunge, and classic metal. The band's eponymous debut album was released through SPV/Steamhammer in May 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kill+Devil+Hill">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
