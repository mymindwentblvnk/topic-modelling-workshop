Battle Dagorath was brought into existence in 2002. Since the beginning invoking haunted pathways through Cosmic Frozen Landscapes and Intense Glorification of Darkness. Reaching into the vast primordial dimensions, Battle Dagorath travels along the gateways of prophecy, dreams, provocation, and unreality. 
Echoing the Omens of celestial and atmospheric phenomena and the cataclysmic order of the stars that manifests into our collective unconscious.
