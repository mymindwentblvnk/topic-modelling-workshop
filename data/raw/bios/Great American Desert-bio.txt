Great American desert is a one man hypnotic doom metal project of Jeremy Christner; also a published occult author.

His releases are currently limited to a self-released 2003 demo "Land of Tears, and a split album with UK doom band Drear entitled "Solipsis/Warring Against the Sun," released in 2006 through Autumn Winds Productions. He has also appeared as a session artist on US Black Metal band Vrolok's Resurgence II and "Void," albums.  

Much like Christner's literature, the lyrics deal with aspects of Evil, Luciferianism, Darkness, Nothingness and Nihilism. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Great+American+Desert">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
