Gravecode Nebula is an experimental black doom metal band conceptualized by Dying and Hel in the Summer of 2006. Originally starting as a three-piece (Dying: guitar, Hel: bass, Zodiac: drums & vocals) in September of that year, the band played several shows before going on hiatus in late 2007. They returned to the stage in July of 2008 with fresh material and a new drummer, Blackgoat, allowing Zodiac to focus fully on vocals. In October 2009, Lupericus Infernale was welcomed to perform effects and other treatments to add even more to the dark atmosphere.

2010 saw the release of a split 7” EP with Krieg on Baneful Genesis Records and the first offering of official material to the public with the song “Midas” which was well received and sold out of it’s initial run

2011 saw the departure of Blackgoat who joined in 2008, to focus on other music and pursuits in life but not before laying down drums on the Gravecode Nebula debut LP… . We all wished our comrade best of luck on his new musical ventures and thank him for all of his hard work, help with arrangements and artistic vision.

Gravecode Nebula entered a dormant state for much of 2012 (only one gig performed with session drummer Abyssos who left shortly after), and a new session guitar player, later to become full member Gliese 581, while still working sporadically on their debut LP.

In the year 2013, Gravecode Nebula prepared to release the said debut LP now entitled “Sempiternal Void.” The digital release was made public on November first the Samhain Holiday 2013, with a CD/Tape/DLP version to follow in 2014.
