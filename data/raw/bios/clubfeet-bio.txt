An alternative dance act with a casually melodic and wispy sound, Clubfeet features a mix of Melbourne, Australia and Cape Town, South Africa natives: Sebastian Cohen (guitar, lead vocals), Montgomery Cooper (keyboards, programming, backing vocals), Vivian Croft (drums), Bennington Le Bruce (keyboards, programming, backing vocals), and Yves Roberts (bass, backing vocals). They debuted in 2009 on New York's Plant Music with "Teenage Suicide (Don't Do It)," an original song with an obvious nod to the 1989 movie Heathers. The following year, the band landed on Mushroom Australia affiliate Illusive Sounds, where they released their first album, Gold on Gold. Along with "Teenage Suicide," the set also featured a cover of James' "Say Something." Heirs & Graces, a moodier second album, was released in 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Clubfeet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
