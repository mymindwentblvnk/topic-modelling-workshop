Industrial metal band from Norway.

Ground Zero System emerged on the scene from the ashes of two local bands late 2004
with their own brand of hard hitting groove based metal mixed with electronic elements.

The band consisted at the time of Kristian, Alf, Simen and Anders.
During autumn of 2006 they entered well respected DUB studio
(Trail Of Tears, Blood Red Throne, Green Carnation) with producer Endre Kirkesola.

The resulting product was the EP "Newropa EP" cited by reviewers as sounding like
"Rammstein on steroids"

After much critical acclaim and live activity the spring of 2007 brought a turning point
in the bands career. The band booked a slot to play at the Inferno festival,
Norwayâ€™s biggest extreme metal event,

A recording deal with Facefront Records was also inked that month
after several smaller and larger labels showed their interest.

Autumn the same year the band entered DUB studio again to record their debut album.
The sessions at the popular studio resulted in the album dubbed "Molotov".

After the recording the band also saw its first lineup change.
Drummer Anders left the fold and was replaced by Lars Erik Asp.

Their debutalbum "Molotov" was released in April 2008.
