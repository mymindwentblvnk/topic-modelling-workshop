The Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra (JLCO) is an American professional big band that is produced by Jazz at Lincoln Center, a major performing arts institution structured as a non-profit organization that is housed in its own facility at the Time Warner Center in Manhattan, New York. Wynton Marsalis is the artistic director for Jazz at Lincoln Center, Inc., and director of and trumpeter with the Orchestra.

The orchestra was founded in 1988 as part of the Lincoln Center’s summer concert series, "Classical Jazz." In 1991 the JLCO became the resident and touring big band for Jazz at Lincoln Center. The orchestra commissions works, which by early 2000, surpassed 60 by composers that include Benny Carter, Benny Golson, Gerry Mulligan, Geri Allen, Marcus Roberts, Melba Liston, and John Lewis.
