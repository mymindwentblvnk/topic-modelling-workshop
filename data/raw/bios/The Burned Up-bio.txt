THE BURNED UP 
The Burned Up band was formed in June 2000, when brothers Boris Bychkov and Roman Terekhov, while listening to their favorite rock bands came up with an idea to create their own one. Sergey Kalynychenko joined as a solo guitarist. Then the searches for the bass guitarist began. One of the friends played bass during the first rehearsals, but then this responsible role was constantly given to Ivan Uryvskiy. After forming the basic collective, Burned Up began serious rehearsals. Everyone being in touch with music knows that it takes much time playing together to form the sound. At this stage the casual and not purposeful people are eliminated. To honor the band it’s necessary to notice, that they have avoided such troubles, and managed to keep the primary structure without changes. During 2003 – 2005 the band worked hard at the technical side of performing, executing numerous covers to their favorite bands «Metallica», «Offspring», «Motorhead» etc. In this period the main direction of the further work was formed, thrash metal riff base, high technical level, and English lyrics. In 2005 the band decided to record the demo. So they rented a room and accepted to work. The lyrics were written by Roman Terekhov, and the musical material was created by general efforts of the members. After two years of work the first cd “…Still the fire burns...” was released. It included 8 tracks. On the 28th of may The Burned Up entered the ''Shelter +'' studio, where Words of Devastation,Painful Demise,Blood Like Fire tracks were recorded. The new CD was called "Blood Like Fire" . At the moment guys are working in the studio to perform in the nearest future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Burned+Up">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
