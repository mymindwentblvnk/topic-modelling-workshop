'Advice to Users' is a mixture of lo fi, noise, shoegaze, indie and acid rock which likes to alternate between electric and placid states. Pieces such as 'White' 'Ywork' and 'Chickpea' which suggests a fresh ambience and whose tempo carries on in the style of shoegazing. The flavour of their sound inevitably recalls My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive.

Worthy of note is also the attractive voice of Nikki, which is both velvet and soft. 'Liftoff' & 'princess' Contrasting with the guitar, feedback and melody like Motorpsycho & Sonic Youth, while 'Emergeny Poncho' puts them on the verge
of trip hop.

In conclusion, 'Advice to Users' is an soft listen (? could be translated in a number of ways - NOT easy listening you'll be pleased to know! But hints at an 'easy to the ear' type of translation)

The ideal disc to relax to and find yourself refuge in a small but vital aural space, a long way from the strains of modern life. On the other hand, this advice to users is clear - work less, earn less spend less and do more.
