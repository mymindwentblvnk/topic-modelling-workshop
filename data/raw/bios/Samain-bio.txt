There are more than one artists with this name.
1) German Heavy Metal Band:
Formed in 1982, most reknowned for the 1984 album "Vibrations of Doom" that the magazine was named after.

2) Australian Black Metal band:
Samain were primarily driven by, and most constantly contained, Nick Bell (guitar) and Warren Hately (Bass, Vocals) and had several drummers over their existence. 

The Band formed in Perth, Western Australia in the early 90s and was active until approximately 1997.

They released a very limited demo which was followed up by the extremely successful (in relative terms) "Indomitus". Some time after this a final demo/EP "Revenge of the Natural" was released. 

Much was made of the fact that Samain were likely to be the first blackmetal band to reach truly widespread audiences hailing from Australia, but internal differences of opinion ensured this never came to pass.

Their influences can be heard in the style and overall sound but at no time do they come accross as derivitive or sound as if they are merely copying another band's sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Samain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
