Indie/post-punk revival band Pilot to Gunner came together in New York City around 1998. Led by the vocals and guitar of Scott V. Padden, Pilot to Gunner also includes guitarist Patrick Hegarty, bassist Martin McLoughlin, and drummer Kurt L. Herrman. The boys debuted on wax in 1999 with the Hit the Ground and Hum EP for "Me Too!"; that led to the 2001 Gern Blandsten full-length Games at High Speeds. A lifetime's worth of American DIY tours, as well as one through Australia, followed, as did the a deal with the Arena Rock Recording Co., which reissued Games at High Speeds with an additional bonus track in early 2003. Games at High Speeds was also picked up by Rykodisc in Europe, and Building Records in Australia. Get Saved was recorded in 2003 with J. Robbins and released in 2004 by ARRCO in the US, Rykodisc in Europe, and Building Records in Australia.

An even more hellacious touring schedule ensued, which found Pilot to Gunner bringing their tightly wound, D.C. inspired rock to nearly all of the lower 48, eastern and western Europe, Russia and Australia while garnering some pretty fawning press blurbs along the way.

The band have been working on their third full-length album for over a year now. No release date has been set, although according to their MySpace blog the album was more or less complete in July 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pilot+to+Gunner">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
