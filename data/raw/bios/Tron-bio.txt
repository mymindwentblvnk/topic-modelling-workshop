1) The alter ego of Samuel Pepper, an English-born musician. 

2) Singer/songwriter Tron Jensen was born in Bergen, on the beautiful west-coast of Norway. As a child, Tron spent hours listening to records and dreaming of making his own music. He started out playing the trumpet in the school band. After experiencing his first romance-bruising, he bought his first guitar and started making songs. 

His skill as an entertainer soon presented him and his musician partner/friend Tommy Sulen, with a lot of opportunities. On a round-the-world trip, working mostly on the square-rigged sailing ship "Søren Larsen", their career was "jump-started" - entertaining people from all over the world. Since then the duo has worked together as professional musical entertainers, performing over 1200 gigs. 

"Søren Larsen" and the time at sea gave way to a passion and fascination of the ocean. Tron started to write songs about the mystic aspects of a journey and about hope, dreams and love. 

In 1996 after a trip to the Amazon jungle visiting the World Rainforest Organization, he produced, and performed the CD "Rainy Day in Manaus" to benefit the organization's projects for children. 

In 1998 he founded Tron Productions and also started to write and develop the songs for the cd ocean. 

He has travelled a lot around the world, and He has had the fortune to work with a variety of very inspiring and good musicians and producers, helping him to create the music into the concept ocean.
