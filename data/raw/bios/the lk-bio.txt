The LK (The Love of Kevin, Colour, Chaos and the Sound of K) is the brainchild of Lindefelt, abstract sound artist, and Fredrik, pop visionary and songsmith par excellence. Fusing  musique concr√®te-style sonic collages with tight pop arrangements, they craft their own brand of playful, elegant "micro-jangle", occupying a snow-sprinkled middle ground between perplexing and hummable. After 2 EP releases of esoteric pop under the moniker Lovekevins, The LK formed definitely in 2006 when the two lanky swedes stopped caring about keeping a band and took on doing what each of them love. Playfulness, dream-fueled high drama and polar interplay between structure, chaos, abstract and concrete make up the trademark LK sound: crisp noise-pop mayhem with an aggregate human presence, sadness and wry sense of humour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+LK">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
