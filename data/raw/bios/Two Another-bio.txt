Musical duo 
The origins of Two Another’s global story lie under the Australian sun. Angus, born in the UK, and Eliot, in the US, connected through the music program at their school in Sydney. Inspired by their parent’s love for Motown, growing up during the golden era of Indie, Ed Banger and later discovering their own love for 90s electronica, dance and hip hop.   After school the best friends first found themselves in different cities in Australia, then Europe, balancing writing trips and remote collaboration for a number of years before finally coming together in London to form Two Another in 2015. They now split their time between Amsterdam and Stockholm.   This spirit of collaboration not bound by borders is at the core of Two Another. Many of their tracks feature performances by musicians from different sides of the globe, each adding their individual flavour to create an effortless fusion of soul, alternative R&B and contemporary electronic music.
