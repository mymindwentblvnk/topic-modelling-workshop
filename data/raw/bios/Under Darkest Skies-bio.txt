Formed after an accidental meeting of four Death  Metal fans who found that they were so connected to each other that they felt they didn't need to speak to communicate with each other. That gave birth to one of the very first Death Metal bands in their country.

They never disclosed their original names.

Stage Names:
Vocalist:           ROASTinHELL  
Lead Guitar:    DEMONreBORN
Drums:            DEVIL BEATZ
Bass Guitar:  DEATHCOLD 666

They played many cover songs and their self written compositions which mostly focused on the understanding that Death and Life are not two very different things.

They split around 2007 due to death of their vocalist, which was a death by choice.

They never joined a group again as they felt the lack of connectivity that they used to have when they played under the names: "PATTHAR" (means STONE), "Doomed Forever". The debut song, "UNDER DARKEST SKIES" became so famous that it stuck to them as the band's name even when they denied that the group name is UNDER  DARKEST SKIES...

In the short career that they had, they got real success and were invited to play in London as well, however that didn't happen as their vocalist felt that his work on earth is complete.  He laughed while jumping to death. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Under+Darkest+Skies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
