With their beginnings as a core-influenced cybergrind band, Broken Bones and Shit began by recording low-quality microsongs, usually consisting of various samples, skits and horse noises. Despite growing rapidly tired of the musical direction of the band, BBAS decided to release their first EP of 15 tracks - "Horse Grind" - purely as a means to get their foot into the musical world outside of their living room. 

After this release was met with the expected extremely low reviews and low sales, BBAS decided to actually put some effort into their music, and changed their direction to Avante-Garde metal with roots remaining in Death Metal and Grindcore. Where song lengths extended, production values increased, and a wide range experimentation took hold. 

Presently, BBAS are on hiatus due to co-founding member Wizard Joe currently attending University in Sheffield, but at every available chance BBAS reunite to record a few more songs for their upcoming (as of yet untitled) 50-track album.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Broken+Bones+and+Shit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
