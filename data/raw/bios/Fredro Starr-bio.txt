Rapper Fredro Starr has a lot on his plate. The Queens, NY, native balances both an acting and a music career. Starr began his rapping career when he founded the hardcore rap/hip hop group Onyx in 1991 with rap compatriots Sticky Fingaz and Sonee Seeza. The group's first album (Bacdafucup, 1993, UNI/Def Jam Records) went platinum, but since the breakup of Onyx after their 1998 album, Shut 'Em Down (Def Jam), Starr (born Fredro Scruggs) ventured out on his own to start his solo career. Starr has also built a solid acting resume (he has had no formal training), starring in numerous television shows and several movies. He starred in the 2000 Paramount/MTV film Save the Last Dance and appeared as Brandy's love interest Quentin on the WB's television show Moesha. The ambitious actor/rapper has had roles in NYPD Blue and such films as Light It Up, Spike Lee's Clockers, and HBO's Strapped. Starr's solo rap debut, Firestarr released in January of 2001. On the track "Soldierz," Starr teamed up with Onyx partner Sticky Fingaz. One of Starr's cuts, "Theme From Save the Last Dance," is featured on the movie's soundtrack song, "Shining Through." In addition, Starr also runs his multi-faceted entertainment entity, OPM (Other People's Money). ~ Kerry Smith, All Music Guide <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fredro+Starr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
