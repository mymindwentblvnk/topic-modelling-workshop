Paladran is a studio project initiated by Heynik who was looking for musicians who can fulfill his vision of dynamic fusion of folk, metal, folklore and meet his musical and personal requirements at the same time.

After many unsuccesful attemtps to find such musicians it turned out that "IEF project" is only one  way how to run this project. IEF for ICQ-email-ftp. Paladran is band without rehearsal and concerts, because the right people are too busy thanks to their musicals abilities and moreover they live all round the country. Excellent solo guitarist was found by Hyenik in Prague (on guitar forum), dream bass player lives in Uherske Hradiste. Rythm and production duo are brothers Slavicinsky.
Thanks to modern technologies and internet is this cooperation possible and Paladran team is getting used to it.
