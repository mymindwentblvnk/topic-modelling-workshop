Dying to Live is a Christian Rock/Rap Band from the Bay Area California. They have a unique combination of Synth filled, hard rock riffs, powerful vocals, and smooth word play, all coming together in a way never heard before. 

Lyrically the band is highly influenced by their lead vocalist Jessie "2TONE" Jones, and his ruff upbringing. Growing up in an abusive house hold, and violent neighborhoods, have given 2TONE a firm understanding of the harsh realities this world has to offer, but the band takes pride in not only relating to these realities, but offering up a solution as well.

Band Members:
2TONE - (Lead Vocals)
Allie Anduza - (Lead Vocals)
Chris Kellems - (Drums/Vocals)
Caleb Leichliter - (Lead Guitar/Vocals) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dying+to+Live">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
