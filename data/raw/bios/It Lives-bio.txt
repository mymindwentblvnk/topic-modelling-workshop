It Lives plays powermetal/speedmetal  with a slight taste of thrashmetal and heavymetal. 
Their biggest musical influences are Overkill, Annihilator, Megadeth, Testament, Running Wild and Savatage.

The band plays their music with a 'wink'. This means that they want to play their songs as good as possible, but they need some humour. So don't expect them to look like 'evil' people standing still, quietly playing music on stage.
The band-members are having fun in making metal and thy try to make a party of every gig. This is their main ingredient for a good gig, maybe that's why they already have some big fans...

It Lives disbanded in 2006
