Throne Of Decadence is a black metal band from Rome, Italy. Forming in 2001, they released their first demo "Instrumental" in 2002. Apparently, it was limited to a mere 3 copies. In 2004, they releaed their MCD "As Fullmoon Rise", followed by their debut "Coronation" (The Oath Rec.) in late 2006.

Ever since 2006, complete silence has surrounded the band and it's unsure whether they're still even active. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Throne+Of+Decadence">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
