Whoever starts describing a band like this must be talking about the German Sludge/
Noise/Elecdrone outfit VOID OBELISK. In 2016, the four musicians without borders will unveil their debut „A Journey Through The Twelve Hours Of The Night“, which was released via Karlsruhe-based label Meta Matter Records and distributed world-wide by Broken Silence. VOID OBELISK stands for a bunch of four musicians coming out of completely different genres and musical socializations. Together they provide their listeners with a maelstrom of many different styles, sounds, and moods on a basis of heavy Doom Metal, raucous Noise Rock, viscous Sludge Metal, and dark Drone Metal. Their mixture of nasty guitar riffs, passionate vocals, deep basses, reduced rhythms, analogue noises, floating Ambient passages, electronic beats, steely Industrial metal, and fuzz-loaded Psychedelic Rock creates a unique sound consisting of torturous slowness, crushing harshness, and disturbing ambience. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Void+Obelisk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
