Michigan- based Artless was formed in the 1980's by Maximum Rocknroll columnist Mykel Board.
They released a half EP (the B-side was an engraving of a cartoon of Mr. Board in military fatigues). More recently they released a CD titled Plugged.

A German Punk band existed in the early 80s. They released one 7' (Mein Bruder is en Popper) and a LP (Tanzparty Deutschland).

There is also a German Melodic Death Metal band under the same name, Artless, who formed in 1996. 
Current Lineup:
Burgi - Vocals, Guitar
Gr√ºtzer - Vocals, Guitar
Kai - Guitar
Jedi - Bass
Jean Peer - Drums

Releases:
- Sense Of Isolation [Demo] (2004)

There also appears to have been a German punk band named Artless formed around the same time.
