'Passion’ or ‘Passionate’ isn’t a word that is used very often when describing the modern metal scene of the past 15-20 years.

Those are the bands that will travel the country to play for five people a night (on average) just because they're passionate about playing music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shall+Be+The+Conqueror">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
