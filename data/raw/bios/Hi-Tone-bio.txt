Los Angeles, CA  Tony Valenzuela p.k.a HI-TONE went to live with his mom and sister at a young age after his parents divorced, due to his fathers abusiveness and alcoholism. Being raised by a low-income single parent mother, HI-TONE got to experience how rough life can be to survive. He began portraying his life experiences and emotions in words and transforming them into poems.

After recording his first song at the age of 15, TONE knew this was his passion and what he was born to do in life. He then started focusing on music as a career, not a hobby. TONE has always been a unique and creative individual that liked to express himself through F.A.M.E. (Fashion, Art, Music, and Entertainment).

At the age of 17, he got his first tattoo and thus his fascination began with the art of tattooing. Having many close friends and family members who are tattoo artists, TONE is now also a professional tattoo artist himself. His body is covered almost in its entirety with intriguing and award winning art.

Having been in a group for many years, TONE is no stranger to the music business. Even though he does not regret the past and is thankful for all the great learning experiences that came with being in a group, he is very excited to be going solo for the time in his music career.

HI-TONE has had a large amount of influence in his life and this comes through in his music. It has not been an easy road by any means, but this rich diversity is what inspires HI-TONE to connect with others. With a love for creativity and a desire to be his most authentic self, he keeps his music personal and undisguised. It is those connections that he lives for, and his supporters that inspire to keep doing what he loves best.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/hi-tone">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
