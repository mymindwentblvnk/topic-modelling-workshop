Andreya Triana is a singer and songwriter from South East London.

Her love of improvisation influenced her 'Freeflo Sessions' - a one woman show using a sampler to loop vocals, percussive sounds and beats live- which gained her a place in the 2006 Red Bull Music Academy in Australia. Tea Leaf Dancers, a collaboration with producer Flying Lotus was then born, catching the attention of Ninja Tune stalwart Bonobo. Featuring on the 2009 song The Keeper, Andreya toured America and Canada with the Bonobo live band, playing on the BBC Introducing stage at Glastonbury showcasing new material and signing a three album deal with Ninja Tune Records.

2010 saw the release of Far Closer, Lost where I belong and A Town Called Obsolete, all extracted from her debut album 'Lost Where I Belong' (August 2010), produced by Bonobo. She also featured on the tracks Stay The Same and Eyesdown.

'Giants' was released on May 2015 by Ninja Tune's offshoot Counter Records, produced by Matt Hales. It was preceded by the singles Everything You Never Had Pt. II and Gold.
