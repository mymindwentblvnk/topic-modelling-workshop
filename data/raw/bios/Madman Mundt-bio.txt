Madman Mundt wrote, recorded and performed underground Rock-N-Roll representative of the urban decay, ridiculous sport team failure and ultra-creative milieu that is Cleveland, Ohio. Inspired by the Cohen Brothers & countless other film and music creators. Madman Mundt is named for the "benevolent" character in the movie "Barton Fink". Mundt was never "mad at anyone" and just wanted to provide his customers with some "piece" of mind.
The Band:
Mark D'Angelo was a true original; inspired, enigmatic, humorous and lyrically gifted. Lost in the uniqueness of his approach is the reality that very few could ever conceive of his vocal arrangements or come close to executing his outrageous and highly divergent delivery. Mark died unexpectedly and tragically in 2008. He was a wonderful person who is sorely missed by family, friends and fellow artists.
Scott Stearns is a tremendous guitar player and an extraordinarily gifted visual artist. Bombastic leads and crunching rhythms combine to serve as an auditory translation of his astounding-hyperbolically dark drawings.
Scott Benedict's drumming is precise, driving and machine-like. His technique reflects a workman's approach combined with a highly creative rhythmic mind.
John Benedict's Bass work is intricately woven with his brother's chops, resulting in a tight-thumping rhythm section that never failed to deliver the punch.
Madman Mundt released two full-length CDs and opened up for several national and regional acts in Cleveland between 2002 and 2005. Disbanded since 2005, the return of the band is highly unlikely because God broke the mold after creating Mark D'Angelo.
