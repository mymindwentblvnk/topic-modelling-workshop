Velten Doering aka Dirty Doering was born in Leipzig in 1978 but grew up in the “Schwarzwald” in southern Germany. Soon the first DJ-gigs arose in places such as the "kulturruine", the "vibration" and the "M1" in stuttgart. Realising that the environment would not provide the skills to develop further, Velten Doering decided to move to the only place that could be– Berlin. Very fast he grew together with the club and underground scene. Soon the most influential locations such as the "BAR25" (resident), "Pfefferberg", "Watergate", "Tresor", "Club 103", "Arena","Maria" and "Sternradio" became the places to see dirty doering playing quite frequently his techhouse and techno sound. Performances of his interpretation of the berlin sound follow at the"Fusion"Festival,"Melt!" festival, in Poland, Studio88 (France), Nadsat (Kopenhagen) "Fabric" (London), "Sonar"Festival (Spain),"Klubbers Day" (Madrid) and some more nice clubs. Since June 2004 he runs successfully a record store "freizeitglauben" together with his DJ colleague André Gardeja. Among others he sets up another well known party series, the "labradorbar". 2006 he founded with Housemeister (bpitch) the label "ALLYOUCANBEAT". Nowadays Dirty Doering is running a digital label "Rauschenbach Music" and he produced some nice remixes for Housemeister, Oliver Koletzki, Chilly Gonzales etc. One of his latest releases is his track "I Would" on the bar25 label (bar25 015)
