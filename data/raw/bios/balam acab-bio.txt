Balam Acab is the musical project of Pennsylvania, USA native Alec Koone. Balam Acab's contributions fit squarely into the contemporary witch house canon made popular by artists such as oOoOO and Salem. Forming tracks consisting mainly of arpeggiated riffs and synthesized beats layered over obscure, distorted samples alluding to classic animated films, Balam Acab creates a dream world worthy of its nostalgic references.
"Balam Acab" is also a Mayan demigod who created rainbows by piercing clouds with arrows. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Balam+Acab">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
