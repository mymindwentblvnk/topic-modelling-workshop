Kele Le Roc is a British-born R&B/Garage singer who released her debut album "Everybody's Somebody" in June 1999.

Two singles were taken from the album, "Little Bit of Lovin'" and "My Love", both of which charted within the UK top ten. Despite the latter winning a MOBO award for "Best Single", Kele was dropped by her record label the day after the awards ceremony and is yet to secure another deal.

Since then, Kele has collaborated with several artists, including Red Rat (on "Thinking of You"), Shy FX & T-Power ("Feelin' U"), Basement Jaxx ("Romeo") Shola Ama and Chanelle ("Imagine"). She also appears in the Channel 4 show "Dubplate Drama".

Le Roc still tours extensively and her official MySpace page states that she is preparing new material for release in the future. There have been plans for the future to record a new album. Now Kele mainly focuses on Garage & Bass music rather than R&B & Soul. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kele+Le+Roc">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
