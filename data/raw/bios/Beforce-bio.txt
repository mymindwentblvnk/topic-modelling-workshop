Beforce is a Heavy/Power Metal band from Spain (Bilbao) that formed in 1996 under the name Overlord and at that time consisted of all present members except Dann Hoyos. When they renamed themselves to Beforce, Dann was brought in to take over lead guitar, allowing Dani Perez (who played guitar prior to Dann's arrival) to concentrate on his singing.Other members are Ignacio Portilla (Guitars), Iñigo Martín (Bass) and Renato Torre (Drums). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beforce">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
