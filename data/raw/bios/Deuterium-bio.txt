Deuterium were a 5 piece Canadian Brutal Death Metal band before breaking up after their 2003 Demo "Blustery Uprising".  Most notably features Alex Pelletier of Despised Icon.  Currently their only release was the 16-minute 3 song Demo.  Apperantly, the band had originally recorded a full length album, but lost most
of it due to computer problems. They decided to release this 3-song demo several years later, from what remained of the full length album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deuterium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
