Earth A.D. are a 3-piece thrash metal band from Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada.

The band has had the same line-up since 1989 and has always been active, playing shows all around the Maritimes (far-eastern side of Canada).

Todd and Shane Mazerolle are brothers.

In 1998, they recorded a video for the song ''No Reason'' which still gets airplay on Muchmusic's metal show ''Loud''. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Earth+A.D.">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
