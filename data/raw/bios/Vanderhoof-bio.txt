Melodic hard rock project named after the band leader and multi-instrumentalist Kurdt Vanderhoof. Other members include Damon Albright, Dave Hawkes, Brian Cokely, Gary Evans and Kirk Arrington.

The music sounds, because of a progressive touch, a lot like Styx and Uriah Heep (also because the use of a Hammond organ). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vanderhoof">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
