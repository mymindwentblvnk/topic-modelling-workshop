"It's dark, but I sing"
(Thiago de Mello)

... We are messengers of eternity ...

Sounds from hope that evoke sadness. Voices and instruments blend words with silence to question the dark walk in this earth. Charting a horizon, covered in the middle of the cold mountains and injured by the rain on our robes, We know the people of the earth, we are rooted in their cries and their hunger,
and evoke a horizon of hope and promise. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aggelos">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
