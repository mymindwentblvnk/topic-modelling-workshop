Noxius is a musical project made up by the duo Filippo Conti and Andrea Valesini. Being two of the youngest dnb producers in Italy, these good old friends began in March 2008 to define the Noxius crew concept and in just a year held down releases on international labels such as M-Atome (FR), Flight Recs (US), Abducted (US), Modulate (IT), Ammunition (US) and they recently won the 2009 edition of the Elettrowave Challenge as best dnb dj/producer. Noxius' music is a synergetic mixture of filthy neuro techy sounds with tasty groovy basslines and funky beats. They collaborate with high level producers such as Dabs and Triage and their sound is repeatedly supported by djs all around the world. Their act has been showcased at the best club nights in Italy as well as Europe and have received great feedback from punters, promoters and djs. Noxius' podcast, "Ordinary Diseases", is out every few months; it features a selection of tunes produced by some of the most skilled and innovative artists known.
