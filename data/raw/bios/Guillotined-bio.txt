Guillotined was formed way back in the year 2007 by Bin Bautista and AC Estandian with it's former name Uteral Regurgity. After they released some demos, They came up with an album titled Souls Eternally Devoured under Brute Productions Thailand. Guillotined received a lot of good feedback from the listeners. The band had their drummer named Renz but didn't last long because of some personal reasons. Bin also had to leave the band to pursue his career as a sea man so Bin talked to Myke Pardo to fill up the vocal part. And in the early year 2012, They found Em Lozano to fill up the skins and Red Mendoza for Bass. After composing some tracks, Guillotined recorded their three track demo and released this August 2013. Guillotined now is in the works for their second full length next year.
