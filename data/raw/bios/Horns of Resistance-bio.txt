Restlessly searching for a new outlet for their creative Ã¼berfury Holger and Yannick launched the nonrecurring project HORNS OF RESISTANCE in late 2007. Both now having found a partner who finally complements their unique style, deep commitment and down-to-earth hardcore attitude, they soon started to make their first specific recording- and producing experiences in their own home studio.

There they began mixing a vast variety of ingredients to the last meal for all fashion followers: Merciless riffing, sweet harmonies, slamming drums, some devastating breakdowns and a few hot two-step parts here and there, spiced with the harsh brutality of different vocal styles!

The aspiring death metal combo is still maintaining their Do-It-Yourself mentality and pledges allegiance to the global metal and hardcore underground scene. Their commitment also manifests in critical lyrics about political, social and ethical issues, especially veganism.

Even a fake record label couldn't stop them with a rip off. With a purposeful online campaign they forced the crook out of business and have now just released their first professionally manufactured demo CD completely on their own.

But studio activities are not the boundaries of their dedication. With Larry, Marc and Gabbo a line-up is now getting completed that is able to nuke stages and who is about to bring some massive partyspass to your town!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Horns+Of+Resistance">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
