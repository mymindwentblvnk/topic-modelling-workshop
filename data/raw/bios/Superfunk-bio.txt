Funky French House formation from Marseilles. Superfunk was first composed of Fabrice Texier (Fafa Monteco), Hamdi Hassen (Mike 303) and St√©phane Bonan (credited as Stephane B on most releases).
After the success of "New Jersey" as Dealers De Funk, the trio released several club tracks on the Fiat Lux label. The album "Hold Up" followed in 2000, which contained the original versions of club favourites "Last Dance", "Lucky Star" and "The Young MC".
Shortly after, Fafa Monteco left the trio to concentrate on a solo DJ career. Bonan and Hassen then decided to team up with Le Sascha as Superfunk Inc. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Superfunk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
