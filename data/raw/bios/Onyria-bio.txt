The Onyria project, founded by producer/guitarist Simon J. Gillman and singer Helena in 2012 in Italy, first earned its web popularity by releasing rock versions of worldwide-renowned hits.

Stepping from the early gothic rock-influenced successful releases, the band slowly transitioned into alternative rock, embracing rawer thematics and a more straightforward style. 

Their current aesthetic pivots on a genuine alternative rock/post-grunge, embellished with dynamics and variety, while exposing a certain degree of vulnerability and criticism against society in lyrics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Onyria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
