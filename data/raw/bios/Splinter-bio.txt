In 2002 they released their first demo 'Luchtkastelen' which made the band play around the Dutch club circuit. In 2003 Mothers Finest guitarist John Hayes 'discovered' Splinter. They played for his solo project as opening act for many times. Hayes produced Splinters second demo 'Reflections' which was received with extremely positive acclaim in magazines like 'Oor', 'Aardschok' and 'iOpages' to name just a few.* In 2004 they recorded most of their repertoire for the unofficial release 'The Devil's Jigsaw'. Again critics were extremely positive about this collection of demo songs. Later that year they would play as support act for supergroup 'Karmakanic', featuring ex. Yngwie Malmsteen vocalist Goran Edman.
In the beginning of 2005 Splinter toured with the Swedish group 'The Flower Kings' as support act.
