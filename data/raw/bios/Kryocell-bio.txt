BIO
KryoCell started up in Liverpool around June 2013, after a long attempt (a few years) by the now vocalist Tomm. Then the whole thing started fully when Ste was brought in followed by Rich, Daz and finally (after breaking a few other drummers) Karl.

Right now we are Death Metal, but we are slowly but surely moving more towards the Brutal Death / Tech Death sounds.

Forming in 2013 after a difficult attempt of finding members to join, Tomm and Moses found Darren (ex-guitarist) and Richard to join after having issues with their previous band. 
Then a struggle to find a solid drummer with no other commitments was a task in itself.
Until Karl joined after the 2013 Metal 2 the Masses competition and then KryoCell was fully formed.

Since the debut gig in early 2014, KryoCell have played along both local and known signed bands such as Laceration, Iniquitous Savagery, Party Cannon, Repugnance, Cancerous Womb, Scordatura, Sinate, Whorion, Necrosis, Kraanium and Crepitation! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/KryoCell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
