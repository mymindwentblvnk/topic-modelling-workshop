West Thebarton are a seven-headed soul-rock hydra, straight out of Adelaide, this slightly-slack true-blue rock septet are into having a real good time. Led by charismatic leader figure, gravel-voiced frontman Reverend Ray, West Thebarton have spent the past few years honing razor sharp riffs, sticking them soundly to seriously tight melodic tones, and careering into bars, festival bills and best of lists. After capturing the attention of Violent Sohoâ€™s James Tidswell the band have scored themselves a juicy record deal from his new label Domestic La La, and have committed their suburban homilies to tape. Their debut album, Different Beings Being Different will be unleashed in May and will see the band touring nationally before heading overseas for a string of debut festival appearances in Europe <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/West+Thebarton">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
