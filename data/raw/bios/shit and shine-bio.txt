Shit and Shine (a.k.a. $hit & $hine, $&$, etc) is an ever changing line-up, frequently with numerous drummers, made up of various collaborators from the U.K. and Texas, revolving around the musical brainchild of drummer Craig Clouse. 

Conceived in London in 2004, the band's noise and hard electronics was first heard on the album "You're Lucky to Have Friends Like Us" from that same year. Injecting his music with a sense of humor, as well as cheeky samples and numerous drummers, Clouse set himself apart from the usual run-of-the-mill noise and experimental acts around at the time. In 2010 he relocated himself and the band back to  Austin, Texas.

Having already gained a cult following due to their legendary one riff / multi-drummer live shows, and following two sold out releases on Riot Season and Latitudes, his productions started to resonate with the industrial and noise revival sounds from the likes of Powell and Russell Haswell in 2012 and beyond. Powell subsequently signed Clouse to his Diagonal label; Clouse released the four-track EP "DIAG004" in 2013. He followed this up with the full-length albums "Powder Horn" in 2014 and "54 Synth-Brass, 38 Metal Guitar, 65 Cathedral" in 2015. These albums saw the band expand its sound by incorporating elements from a range of styles, from jazz to metal, techno and even eighties pop and disco, although not always in a serious manner.

One of the strengths of Shit and Shine is its ability to wrong-foot fans and critics alike. After glowing praise for the band's less noisy electronic work, Shit and Shine released the straight-up grindcore album "Teardrops" in 2016.

SHIT AND SHINE are primed to explode.
