Brondniht is a three man project from London, UK: Aidan Foley (vocals), John Harrison (guitars, bass), Michael Wright (drums). They play extremely slow and melodic doom with black metal influences and Old English/Anglo-Saxon lyrics. The lyrics are taken from the Codex Exoniensis - one of the oldest written sources of Anglo-Saxon poetry in existence. The name of the band roughly translates as "night of fire" and the name of the album means "the coldest fruit". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brondniht">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
