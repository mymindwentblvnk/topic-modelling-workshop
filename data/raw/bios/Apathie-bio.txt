There are two groups and/or artists known as Apathie.

1. Black Metal from Germany (Saxony)

2. EBM from the U.S.A. (New York)
Eric Nielsen started making electronic music at the age of 18 or so.  Armed with a MIDI controller, step sequencer, microphone and plenty of samples- he went out to try and smash every electronic sub-genre he could.

Completely blurring the lines between industrial, noise, jungle and EBM- the goal was to keep everything as unconventional as possible.

So far over the course of 6 years and 7 albums (all entirely free for download at his web site,) the music has changed but the mission never has.  Never one to just be happy with layers of pads and arpeggiators- Apathie has been constantly re-defining what industrial music is and should be.

Note:  His music can be downloaded for free over at Aschenwelt.com.
