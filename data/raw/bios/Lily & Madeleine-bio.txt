Lily & Madeleine is an American folk-pop duo from Indianapolis, Indiana, consisting of sisters Lily and Madeleine Jurkiewicz. They have released full-length studio albums, Lily & Madeleine (2013), Fumes (2014), Keep It Together (2016) and Canterbury Girls (2019)

Their first EP was entitled The Weight of the Globe. Their songs are the product of two distinct musical personalities. Madeleine, the older sister with a light, smooth singing style, leans towards folkier, singer-songwriter fare; Lily helps lean the duo towards its gentle rock edge, and has a dark, earthy voice to match.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lily+&+Madeleine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
