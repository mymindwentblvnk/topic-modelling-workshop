Life Eclipse was formed in 2002 ny Niklas Sandin and Jonatan Persson. They play a quite raw, yet melodic form of black metal. In 2003 Fredrik JÃ¶rnsved joined on bass, and Viktor Eklund on drums, and the line up was complete. A few guitar players have joined the band for gigs and such, (Adam, Tasse, Simon, Dr John) but Life Eclipse is now without a second guitarist. A six track demo was recorded in 2005. The band is inactive at the moment, but have not split-up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Life+Eclipse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
