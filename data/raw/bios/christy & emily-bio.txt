"Comprised of a self-taught indie rocker and a classically trained pianist, Christy Edwards and Emily Manzo (aka Christy & Emily) formulated their brooding, spare, atmospheric blend of indie rock and alternative country-rock in Brooklyn in the early 2000s. Manzo was trained at the Oberlin Conservatory prior to playing in the duo, and was beginning to make a name for herself in the New York classical world by the time she teamed up with Edwards courtesy of her collaboration with video artist Paul Rowley on an interpretation of the works of John Cage. Edwards, on the other hand, taught herself to play the guitar when she was growing up in California, and went on to play with New York bands like L'il Fighters, the Totallys, and Brute Force prior to and during her collaboration with Manzo. In keeping with their twangy, slightly ragged sound (something that would have the duo likened to acts as disparate as the Velvet Underground, the Carter Family, and Galaxie 500), the group signed to the rootsy, Brooklyn-based Social Registry label soon after they started working together. Christy & Emily's debut album, Gueen's Head, was released in 2007." - allmusic guide www.allmusic.com
