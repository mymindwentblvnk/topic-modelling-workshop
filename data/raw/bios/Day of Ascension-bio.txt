Day of Ascension is a Christian melodic black metal band with thrash and progressive elements. It includes a lot of expirimentation, and that adds to it. It was started on the 26th of August, 2006. For a while, it was only a concept for Elan O'Neal and Eugene Pisarenko, who both were believers in Christ and wanted to play this type of music for a great cause. It wasn't until recently that it came together and became a reality. Soon, Andrew Blair agreed to lend his skills to the band through the bass guitar. The three needed a little help getting the band started and called on Dan Eneberg to help with lead guitar and microphone equipment. Soon after, Dan took to the keys instead of guitar. A few weeks later, the band recieved Bill Thomas as their vocalist. The band was now complete.... or so they thought. After a time the band was forced to depart with Bill, and after a few months without a vocalist he was replaced by Sean Sanford, who helped to add more of a black metal aspect to the band. In early October of 2007, shortly before the completion of their demo, it was now Sean's turn to part with DoA... Currently they are searching for a replacement.

This band is lyrically Christ-centered, but not preachy. They don't want to try to force anyone to believe in Christ, but to only make people aware and to make them think about the possibilities and the life-changing process that awaits when when they do. The lyrics are bold, and at times, complex....
