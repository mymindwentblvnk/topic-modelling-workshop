1) Manson Family represents a small stable of South gangsta rappers associated with Tommy Wright III of Street Smart Rappers (Memphis, TN): K-Rocafella, C-Rocafella, C-9, Princess Loko, Lil' Sko, Mac T-Dog, and producer Maceo. They have released several albums, including "Heltah Skeltah". Their recordings maintain a horror film ambience and mid-tempo drum machine bounce.

2) The Manson Family features members of the Charles Manson "family."  Most of the male vocals are sung by "family" member Steve "Clem" Grogan. Other members appearing on the albums are Sandra Good, Lynette Fromme, Catherine "Gypsy" Share, Catherine "Cappy" Gillies, Nancy "Brenda" Pitman and Ruth Ann "Ouisch" Moorehouse.  "The Family Jams" is an album recorded in or around 1970.  The album was released in 1997, and although Charles Manson himself does not appear on any of the tracks, he is given writing credit for all of the songs.  
The Manson Family got everyone together in early 1970 (including Bruce Davis then wanted by the FBI) in the Spahn Ranch saloon, to record music for Robert Hendrickson's MANSON film. This was the beginning of the Family Jams, but the original audio tapes remain buried in a vault.

Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids has released an unrelated album with the same title, but this is not to be confused with the Manson Family's album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Manson+Family">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
