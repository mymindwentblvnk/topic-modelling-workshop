Outright Resistance is a heavy metal quintet that is looking to add their own style into a scene over populated with fringes and hair straighteners. Hailing from rural Hertfordshire, Outright Resistance have managed to hide away from what fashion has told metal to do and bring back an old ethic of hard hitting riffs and straight talking groove combined with a new perspective on what metal can embrace. Influenced by such bands as Machine Head, Chimaira & Lamb Of God (amongst others) They bring forth a collective collaboration of 5 individual playing styles, sounds & abilities which were combined in the melting pot, resulting in the ferocious drums, blazing guitars, rumbling bass and screaming vocals that assault your ear drums with rhythmic groove & melody
