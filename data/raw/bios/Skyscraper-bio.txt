1) Skyscraper were a UK-based alternative rock band formed during 1992. The original line up consisted of Vic Kemlicz (guitar/vocals), Adi Vines (bass) and Oliver Grasset (drums). Their debut album Superstate was relased in 1995 to critical acclaim, including a KKKKK review in Kerrang!. During 1995 the band were joined by second guitarist Adam Lamprell and later by drummer Craig Adrienne who replaced Grasset in 1996.

Although the band's music was superfically similar to the grunge style that was popular at the time, it incorporated industrial and noise rock characteristics with a melodic inventiveness and an unusual guitar style which brought the band swift attention. Despite being favourites of the UK rock press the band split after the recording of their second album Shooters in 1997.
