Since their beginning in the early years of the third millennium, Finnish black metal group DEATHKIN have had their motivation and goals clear - dedication to chaos, immorality and the overwhelming power of death. Forging this majestic trinity into musical form in all the honesty and humility it demands, DEATHKIN have previously released two EPs of versatile, epic and fierce black metal, ultimately preparing themselves for the creation of their debut album "Kohti Kotiani Kaaosta" to be released on the 1st of November 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deathkin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
