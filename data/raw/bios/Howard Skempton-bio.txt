Howard Skempton (b. Chester, Cheshire, England, United Kingdom, 1947), is a British composer and accordionist, and one of the founder members of the Scratch Orchestra, formed in 1969. His output has been linked to the musical movement known as minimalism.

Skempton studied musical composition with Cornelius Cardew, and took part in Cardew's new music lectures at Morley College, London. Skempton's work is characterized by a conventional approach to harmony and a stripped down, essentials-only choice of materials, creating miniatures of great simplicity. His most recognised and widely known orchestral work is Lento (1991). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Howard+Skempton">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
