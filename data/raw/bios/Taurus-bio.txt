There are multiple artists who have gone under the name “Taurus”, including multiple metal bands, a trance DJ, a R&B girlgroup active in 2006 and a rap group. 

1) Taurus is a two-piece band from Portland, Oregon.

“Their view; it is cosmic. Not of a man here, a child there, but an abstraction. Not honorable men, but of honor itself; the abstract is real, the actual is invisible to them, It is their sense of space and time. They see through the here, the now, into the vast black deep beyond, the unchanging. And that is fatal to life. Because eventually there will be no life; there was once only dust particles in space, the hot hydrogen gases, nothing more, and it will come again. This is an interval. The cosmic process is hurrying on, crushing life back into the granite and the methane; the wheel turns for all life. it is all temporary, And these- these madmen- respond to the granite, the dust.”
