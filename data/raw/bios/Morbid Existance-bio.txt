Morbid Existance is a three member band formed by Kyriakos Louca (vocals), Demetris Ioannou (Drums) and Vassilios Pantziaros (Guitar). The band was created in July 2009 just to give a try at a contest, "Bandsfest", which takes place in Cyprus. After band had a great performance at "Bandsfest", and as people's comments for the band were great they decided to keep the band together and keep going.
