California Smile is an instrumental band from Cranston/Providence Rhode Island. Before writing the material for their first full-length album, the band was made up of the four core members, Jared Lafond, Victor Mansella, Mike Murphy, and Jake Lafond. Around the 2007-2008 period, the sessions for recording A Secret Message From Your Teeth begun, and two new members (Cameron and Joanna) were added to the mix. They are the multi-instrumentalist and violinist, respectively. 

California Smile is currently playing shows and selling merchandise promoting this new release, and investing their time in various side projects (Leather Bastard, N.I.D., Bimania).
