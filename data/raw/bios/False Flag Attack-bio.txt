Grindcore band started by four young musicians from  Crailsheim (Germany). Since the beggining they want to sound fast, short and direct with mince-core lyrics inspired on bands such as: Agathocles, Nasum, Napalm Death, Feastern, Kill The Client, Pig Destroyer, Looking For An Answer, Phobia, Wormrot, etc. At date the band has recorded two EPÂ´s and two long albums with a very good result.....    Grind The Nazi Scum.
