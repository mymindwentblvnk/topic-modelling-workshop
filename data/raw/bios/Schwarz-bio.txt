2. Schwarz is an indie, post-rock, psychedelic, Spanish band formed in 1997 in Murcia, Spain, as Alfonso Alfonso’s solo project, releasing his first album, These Songs Mean Nothing (1998), a year later. Soon the project became a full band effort. After releasing a second album, Hard Listening (2000), the band consolidated the line up that has remained until today: Alfonso Alfonso on guitar, guitar synth, guitorgan, moog synthesizer, theremin and vocals; Juanma Martínez on bass, baritone guitar and moog and waldorf synthesizers; and César Verdú on drums, synare 3 and percussion. 2001 saw the release of Heptágono (2001), a collaborative effort with the Spanish band Manta Ray. The album, and the following mini-tour, were highly acclamed by the Spanish musical press. 

Since then, they have released three more albums: Cheesy (2002), Arty Party (2004) and Heavengazers (2007), one EP (Schwarz Play Christian Rock  in 2002)., and contributed to several compilations both in Spain and abroad. They’ve played some of the most well known music festivals in their Country (Benicassim, BAM, Tanned Tin, Primavera Club), and have toured Europe several times.
