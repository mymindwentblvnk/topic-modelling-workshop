2) NOIZ is the early setup of what eventually became Imitation PoPs 宇宙戦隊NOIZ. They released one album on March 21 1999 called Imitation PoPs and a single in August 2000 before they gave their band a new name.

3) Five O'side locals, four of them from El Camino High, came together October 2005 to jam out some Roots Rock Reggae. Heavily influenced by the irie vibes of Bob Marley and Steel Pulse among others, these four bring reggae to a whole new level with true reggae and rock sensations. Surfer vibes from these guys bring inspiration and personality to the table. Loyal to other up and coming bands, NOIZ is a big supporter of local music in San Diego county.
