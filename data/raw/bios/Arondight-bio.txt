Arondight was founded at the beginning of Summer 2005 by Raven (bass), Estel (lead guitar) Dargor (rhytm guitar). Quite difficult start (e.g. defects of gear, rehearsal hall and unsuccessful searching for vocalist and drummer) haven't stopped them to play. In 2006 they gave their first small instrumental gig (at their old school - Gymnasium in Krosno). As effect of this event, they found a drummer (Jonasz Kubaszczyk), and started to practise with drums, also prepared new compositions. 

Few months later, Jaromir Przewoźnik joined Arondight as a vocalist. 
Finally, they could compose their songs with all ingredients necessary to play heavy metal! 

In the end of 2006, they have played their first concert with complete line-up (Krosno - Gassbar). 
Since then, they have played lot of gigs at the nearest area. E.g. WOŚP, Airport in Krosno, Rzeszów, KDK Krosno, many pubs and places alike. 

In 2007 they finally recorded first demo material "Incoming Siege" ("Chinook" studio - Dębica).
