Trizna was founded in 1988 by guitar player Konstantin Seleznev, drummer Stas Voznesensky and bass player Andrey Guklengoff. As they were able to rehearse often, they achieved a good mutual understanding. The 17-years-old vocalist Ilia Alexandrov joined the band and in 1992 the first serious demo "Out Of Step" was recorded.

Beside hot "Anthrax-like" thrash there were elements of jazz rock and progressive metal that made the material very original and hardly predictable.

In August' 92 the band took part in "Rock On Barricades" fest, wich was devoted to the victory of Russian people over dictatorship.
