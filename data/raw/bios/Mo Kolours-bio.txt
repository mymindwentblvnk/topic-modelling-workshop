London-based singer-percussionist Joseph Deenmamod, AKA Mo Kolours, produces an eclectic blend of mellow hip-hop influenced by the Sega music of his African roots. Sega music is a percussion-heavy blend of rattles, hand drums and triangles, and the influence is prominent throughout Kolours’ work.

Mo Kolours released his debut EP in 2011. ‘EP 1: Drum Talking’ is a muted, yet hypnotic, introduction to his world, which is rife with lo-fi reggae-electro hybrids. Drum talking is the best way to describe his aesthetic; drums are a stand-out feature, with Kolours showing off his percussionist skills on each track. Vocal samples are also manipulated to create beats that are layered to be performed over.
