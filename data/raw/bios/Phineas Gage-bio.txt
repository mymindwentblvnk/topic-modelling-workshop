There are three groups that are known by the moniker Phineas Gage.

1.  Hardcore Metal group Phineas Gage, based out of Gore, Oklahoma, has blasted on the local metal scene having put out only a three song demo in 2011.  How can you go wrong with a heavy metal band hailing from a town called Gore?  You can't; and these guys prove it!  Check out their MySpace page to hear their 3 demo tracks.

2.  Phineas Gage is a hip-hop collective based in Gambier, Ohio, revolving around three core members: MC Jersey Freeze, the Lion of Zion, and the Most Dangerous Man.  While these three are the driving force behind the group, they are far from averse to collaborations, both with fellow rookies such as San Francisco's Minister of Defense and Philadelphia's AGP as well as with veterans such as Amherst, Mass.'s R-Wally and Kansas City, KC's infamous Shiples.  Currently in the process of writing and producing their first songs, the group is expected to explode onto the greater Knox County scene in the early months of 2009.
