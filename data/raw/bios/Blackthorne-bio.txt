Ahh Blackthorne, who could possibly remember this 'supergroup' of sorts from the very early 1990s? With Bob Kulick on guitar, Frankie Banalia on drums, Jimmy Waldo from the ashes of Alcatrazz, and 'legendary' vocalist Graham Bonnet (who has sung for Rainbow, MSG, Impelleteri, Forcefield and others) combine their skills into the one off record known as "Afterlife".
