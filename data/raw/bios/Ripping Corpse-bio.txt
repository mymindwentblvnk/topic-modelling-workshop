Ripping Corpse was a New Jersey based death/thrash metal band formed in 1987. They released 4 demos: Death Warmed Over in 1987, Splattered Remains in 1989, Glorious Depravity in 1990 and Industry in 1992, as well as one full length Dreaming With The Dead which was released in 1991. Dreaming with the Dead is widely regarded as an old school death metal classic by critics and genre enthusiasts alike, and is praised for its sinister mood, harsh vocals and complex yet focused songwriting and musicianship. Erik Rutan then went on to Morbid Angel and several of the other members formed Dim Mak whose debut album was engineered by none other than Erik Rutan himself. The band recorded a final three-song demo in 1992 and also a new full-length album consisting of eleven songs which was never released as the band split up in 1995. Although they may not have reached the same levels of success and influence as many of their peers, Ripping Corpse remain revered by many. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ripping+Corpse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
