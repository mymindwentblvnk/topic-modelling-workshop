Sorority Noise was an indie/punk band hailing from East Hartford, Connecticut. The band is comprised of members of Old Gray, Real Life Parody and Prawn.

Indie quartet Sorority Noise were formed in 2013 by singer/guitarist Cameron Boucher, who also fronts the New Hampshire-based screamo group Old Gray. Looking for an outlet for some alternate material, he enlisted Old Gray drummer Charlie Singer, along with Prawn bassist Ryan McKenna and second guitarist Adam Ackerman, to form Sorority Noise in Hartford, Connecticut. After a handful of early releases, including a cassette EP and digital single, Boucher and his bandmates delivered their debut LP, Forgettable, in early 2014. Fusing bits of emo and pop-punk with melodic indie rock, the band eventually caught the attention of respected East Coast indie Top Shelf Records. Released in June of 2015, Joy Departed, their follow-up album -- and debut for Top Shelf -- took a more diverse and introspective approach. It was followed by a national tour with Motion City Soundtrack.The year 2016 saw both the release of a new Sorority Noise EP, It Kindly Stopped for Me, and the reissue of their debut album, Forgettable, via Broken World Media. These served to set up the release of their deeply introspective third full-length, You're Not as _____ as You Think, this time arriving via Triple Crown Records in early 2017. A reimagined all-acoustic version of the album was released a year later under the title YNAAYT, further emphasizing the band's increasingly reflective tone. ~ Timothy Monger, Rovi
