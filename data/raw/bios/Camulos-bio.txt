Camulos is a black metal band from Germany formed in 2002.

The band is one of the most successful publications of the record label "Christhunt Productions". The name of the band was inspired by and is the same as the Celtic god of war.

Lyrically "Camulos" picks the Christianity out as a central theme, genre typically in harsh, aggressive way, but musically comparatively melodic. They released two albums, both in 2003. Their debut album "Untermensch (mit Namen Christ)" (Sub-human, called Christ) has been banned in Germany. Their second album "Spiel des Blutes" (Game of blood), regarding content and stylistically very similar, isn't banned in Germany. In 2005 they released a split with Ainshval.
