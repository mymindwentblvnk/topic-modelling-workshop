Burn Athena are a death metal/deathcore band hailing from Brisbane, Australia. Formed in mid 2007, the band line-up went through several changes until being finalised in May '08. The line up of Joe, Chris, James, Jake and Dan wrote songs and played gigs until August 2009, when James left the band. Recordings of this line up exist, which can be found on their MySpace: http://www.myspace.com/burnathena.

The band later carried on playing as a four piece, searching for a replacement guitarist as of September 2009. In 2010, the band decided to call it quits, while three members (Dan, Joe, and James) went on to form The Archivist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burn+Athena">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
