dios Malos (the D is always lowercase) is an indie rock band based in Hawthorne, California in the United States. The band consists of vocalist/guitarist/keyboardist Joel Morales, bassist John Paul Caballero, keyboardist James Cabez DeVaca, and drummer Jackie Monzon. The band formed in 2002 and is on the indie label Startime International.

In the summer of 2004, the band was forced to change their name from dios after heavy metal singer-songwriter Ronnie James Dio filed a cease-and-desist order claiming the name dios was too similar to Ronnie's own band, Dio.

In October of 2005, the band released their sophomore album self-titled dios Malos. The second album was produced by Phil Ek, who has produced many popular indie-rock albums which include multiple Modest Mouse and Built to Spill albums, and The Shins second album, Chutes Too Narrow. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dios+Malos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
