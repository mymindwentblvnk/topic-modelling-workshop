Tytus is an up-and-coming singer/songwriter from Greenville, SC. As a solo artist at the moment, he is working his way to an Indie label and eventually to obtaining more band members and establishing a massive fan base. Working hard to start his career, Tytus is open for any chance he can get to play a live show. He is willing and able to play for exposure. Although he has a variety of songs up his sleeve, the heart of the music comes from his Christian faith. While some songs are about experiences in life, others just break it back down to the basics and give thanks to God for the journeys of life. Tytus music is not just surface-deep. He has a heart for helping others and a dream to do so through his talents and music.
