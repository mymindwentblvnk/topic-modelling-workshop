Evan Sornstein may be most at home working under the name of Curium, which he has espoused for almost 20 years. During that time he has released fourteen suites of music ranging from the haunting and histrionic to the audacious and alchemical. Evan has long been a staple of the San Francisco electronic music scene and has enjoyed contributing to several bands of varying genres, including Battery, Nux Vomica, Sinjin, and Axoe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Curium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
