Horde of Draugar formed in [Cheyenne, Wyoming]  in [2011]. The line up consists of [Anastacio "Andy" Arias =2011], [Matt Warner =2011], [Josh Stamey =2011], [Joe Delumba =2011], and [Elijah Parsons =2011]. HoD started with Matt and Andy writing guitar parts together. After a long and arduous search for a drummer, Josh finally committed to this new project. While tirelessly practicing and writing new songs, HoD was joined by Joe to front the band. The band played their first show in January 2012 and immediately hit the studio to record their debut album "Birth of a Draugr" which was self-released in October 2012. Shortly before the release of their debut album, they had finally found a full-time bass player in Elijah. Horde of Draugar continues to write new songs with the hope of releasing material on a regular basis. They also continue to spread their name by playing shows to fans as much as possible. Hail the Horde! Join the battle!
