Unusual among bands associated with stoner rock and doom metal, Cambian Dawn displayed prog rock and classic rock influences as well as good old early 90s Seattle grunge.

The band's final (and finest) recording, the "Wolves In The Springtime” EP, was released on the 18th of June 2007 and is available to download from all major digital services, with 12” Vinyl and compact disc available from VillainousRecords.com.

Cambian Dawn's personnel are currently missing, presumed drunk.
