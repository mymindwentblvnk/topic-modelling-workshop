One of the first metal-bands of Soviet Union/Rossija. Command was alive since winter of 1985 till 2000 (last live performance). Disorder was not. Circumstances have appeared more strongly. For 15 years - 2 albums. A command distinctive feature - riffing and rhythmic saturation of a material. On 16 ready songs about 300 counters (reeves), not including other distinctions... On the average change of guitar drawing - 18 seconds. Standard schemes of construction of songs are specially broken. A minimum of tools - a result maximum, here an aim. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dispensary">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
