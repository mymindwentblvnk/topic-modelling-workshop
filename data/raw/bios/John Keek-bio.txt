DC-born, Las Vegas-raised John Keek crafts breathless, jazzy R&B that is as emotional as it is danceable. With a background in jazz saxophone and an eclectic taste in music, Keek's songs blend the coolness of Towa Tei with the disjointed soul of James Blake. Although Keek's discography is limited to a few songs on Soundcloud, he has made ripples across the web, even being named one of Pigeons and Planes' "Best New Artists" in October 2015. He is currently in the process of recording an EP, and his favorite animal is the sea turtle. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/John+Keek">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
