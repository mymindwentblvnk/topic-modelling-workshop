Discovered by Tim Sweeney and the first release on the Beats in Space record label, Paradis might be one of the most ambitious projects to come out of France in recent years. Simon Mény and Pierre Rousseau have bold musical offerings, inviting us to the unlikely meeting of french pop with the contemporary textures of dance music. At the crossroads of introspection and emotion, Paradis’ productions and dj sets are a testament of their broad and diverse approach to party music.

Reared on classical and jazz, turned young hip hop rebels, turned teen club crawlers, and then university machine tinkerers, Simon Mény & Pierre Rousseau grew out of genre jumping while young enough to stay ahead and settle into music making centred around melody and emotion.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paradis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
