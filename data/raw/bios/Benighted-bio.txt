3) Benighted: is a Swedish black metal band. They formed around 2001 by Aho, as he had just left Immemoreal and wanted to start something of his own, and be able to have full control of the productivity. Salle was the obvious choice of a drummer, since they had been playing together before in several death and black metal bands, and had also been friends since years back.

So far this Benighted has released two demos entitled "Heljarför" and "Avgrundshjärta".
