2) 1994 - The band is formed in Mikkeli, Finland. Jarkko Laatikainen, Juha Kivikanto and Sami Lintunen, together with bass player Harri Valkonen played together in a band called Caricature, but as the band's founder Perttu Noponen left the group, the rest of the guys wanted to continue with a different name and a different focus.

1995 - First gigs were played and the first demo tape was recorded including a Black Sabbath cover "Wizard". A second guitarist was needed, so Tero Pantsar joined Rite.

1996 - Heavily Black Sabbath influenced "Demo Galaktus" was released including a 9-minute slow doom metal song "Flower". The song was often the last song in their live set.

1997 - "Blackflash" demo was recorded. The tape showed first signs of Rite's heavier future. The songs got shorter and louder still retaining the clear references to heavy rock of the 1970's.

1998 - Harri Valkonen left the band. Rite played some Black Sabbath tribute shows in Finland. Manu Kuitunen was recruited as Rite's new bass player.

1999 - Rite's first CD-era demo "Goddamn" recorded at Studio Watercastle in Jyväskylä, Finland. It was clearly heavier than the previous Rite recordings with only vague traces of the evident Black Sabbath influences of the past. Rite started rehearsing in Helsinki as most of the members had moved there.

2000 - "Goddamn" is released as a 7" vinyl EP by the French record label Water Dragon Records. The EP gets great reviews all over the world.

2001 - Tero decides to leave Rite. The band continues as a 4-piece group and records their debut album in September at Studio Watercastle.

2002 - Janne Savolainen joins Rite on spring. Rite's first full-length album "Shoot Skull For Jackpot" is released in November by Water Dragon Records. The album title is taken from a text on a pinball machine. More and more gigs played.

2003 - The debut album is highly acclaimed worldwide. A video is shot for the opening track "Bastard Song" on a pig farm. Touring continues and new even heavier Rite songs are written. Metal and punk rock influences are audible.

2004 - A five-track EP "The Creep Had It Coming � Part 1" is released through the band's own record label Multiplatinum Records. The EP is again praised by reviewers everywhere. First gigs abroad including an appearance on Europe's biggest stoner rock festival "Stoned From the Underground" in Erfurt, Germany.

2005 - The band writes new songs and records their second full-length album at Studio Watercastle. The new album "Hobo Metall" is a loud combination of rock, metal and punk rock. An attentive listener may still find a connection with Rite and 70's heavy rock.

2006 - "Hobo Metall" released by Longfellow Deeds (ex-Water Dragon Records) in March.

2008 - "Death I Hear You Calling But I Can't Come Home Rite Now" is released in autumn.

2009 - Janne Savolainen leaves the band in spring. Juuso Saranki steps in as a 2nd guitar player.
