Rosa Negra is a project within the "Novo Fado" ('New Fado') movement in Portugal. An intensely adventurous "Fadista" celebrating passionate Fado cradled in a web of musical arrangements full of Iberian/Mediterranean inspirations: with percussion, strings, trumpet, piano and accordion always pointing to the Orient.

Rosa Negra was a Heavy Metal band from Madrid, Spain.  They released two albums Rosa Negra in 1984 and El Beso de Judas in 1985. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rosa+Negra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
