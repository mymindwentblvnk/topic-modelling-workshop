Having studied and privately performed music on a variety of instruments across a number of styles for several years, composer and multi-instrumentalist Daniel Dockery began publicly releasing work in 2002 under the name Agrypnia in classical, romantic and neo-classical styles. The release of new material under this name officially ceased in January, 2011.

The bulk of the material appearing under this name consists of strictly original works, but occasionally there are arrangements and experimental reworkings of some piece or other that caught the artist's attention, such as the album Salieri's Mass No. 1 (in Bb minor) which presents a different (Bb minor) take on Antonio Salieri's original Mass in D, or works on a smaller scale such as individual compositions of Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber, Camille Saint-Saëns, Edvard Grieg, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Johann Sebastian Bach, etc., on instruments ranging from the traditional to the more modern, which may be found on one or another of the albums available here, the official Facebook page or discussed on the artist's blog, Philemonasmia.

Influences include the above cited composers as well as Erik Satie, Frédéric Chopin, Sergei Bortkiewicz and Arvo Pärt among the foremost, with explorations of the latter's methods of tintinnabuli occurring in several works and passages.
