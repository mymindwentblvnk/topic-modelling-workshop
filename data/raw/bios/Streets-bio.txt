Streets is a rock band that Kansas vocalist Steve Walsh formed in the 80s. They released two albums for Atlantic Records starting with 1983's 1st, and 1985's Crimes In Mind. The former featured the hit If Love Should Go, but both albums didn't do very well in the sales market, and Atlantic dropped them in 1985. Wounded Bird Records reissued both the band's albums on CD in 2002.
