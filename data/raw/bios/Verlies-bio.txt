Verlies is a former one-man-band from Lille, France, born from the head of N., its guitarist-singer.
After the recording of a first demo CD under the name of Veahayne Verlies, N. stoped this project due to a lack of motivation to continue all alone.
Nethertheless, the ideas flew through the same stream and the creation of the whole new material - wich seemed a lot more mature and more serious - never ended.
Throughout the years, N. participated to many different projects (Mutill, Vague Noire, Nibirus, and many others). When he met Flo, the idea to wake up the old entity came to his mind.
After some times playing with the bassist T. and the participation of Gilles behind the drumkit, the rebirth of the band came along with a change of name, becoming simply "Verlies".
Quickly, Gilles left the band, but G. took his place as the new Drummer.
Strengthened by the new member, the whole band started to prepare themselves in order to climb up on stage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Verlies">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
