1. American harsh noise
2. Thrash metal/black metal band from Switzerland

1. At its peaks, the volume and textural aggression Scathing delivers can be absolutely suffocating. But it never rests on a single angle too long and maintains a lot of dynamics and movement that you might not expect from a searing c30 like this. The sounds have familiar ingredients from the greats of American harsh noise but come together in a brew entirely of Scathingâ€™s making. Absolutely one of the most consistent rippers smashing pedals today.

2. A Thrash Metal / Black Metal band from Switzerland, formed in 1999.
They released two Demos in 2001 and a Live album in 2002. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scathing">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
