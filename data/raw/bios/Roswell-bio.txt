There have been at least two bands called Roswell.

1) Roswell were a band from Penzance, Cornwall (UK) who were active during the years 1997 - 2001. They released one self titled album to much critical acclaim throughout England and were a cult hit amongst students of the generation.

Tracklisting: Indigo, Grey Day, Yellow Pie, Blame It On the Recess, Untitled, Talking About Nothing, Strange Place, Spirit Down, Feed Me, Everything Ruined, Too Hot, D.N.O., Satan Drives The Big Machine, When I Get High and a bonus instrumental track.

2) Roswell was a Swedish hardcore/metal band that released their debut EP "The Nothing" on Only Ruin / Bridge Records in 2002. Roswell split up in early 2005, just some time after having released their full length album called "Void" on Caccaphonus Records. After the breakup, the members of Roswell went on to form Tid.

3) Roswell is an alias of prolific Dutch producer Erik van den Broek.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Roswell">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
