There are two active bands using the moniker Red Giant, one from Cleveland, Ohio and the second from Chico, California.

Back in the late summer of 1990, Damien Perry, Brian Skinner Chris Gorman, and Alex Perekrest formed Red Giant. They shared a connection through a love of classic punk, rock, and metal bands- like AC/DC, Motorhead, The MC5, Black Sabbath, and The Stooges.

In 1995, Red Giant released "Psychoblaster and the Misuse of Power", cementing their footprint on the emerging stoner rock scene. As years unfolded, they shared stages with many respected bands...Mule, Voivod, Hawkwind, Queens of the Stone Age, Fu Manchu, Nebula, and Hermano - to name just a few.

In 1998, Red Giant released their second CD, "Ultramagnetic Glowing Sound" on New York's Tee Pee Records which was also home to cool bands like The Atomic Bitchwax, and High on Fire. Renowned illustrator Derek Hess created the artwork for the album, keeping to the band's theme of the cosmic welder. This was around the time they started traveling more, playing showcases at The Continental and CBGB's in New York City.

Then in 2004 they released "Devil Child Blues" on Small Stone Records out of Detroit Michigan- home to some of our favorite bands like Honky, Valis, and Dixie Witch. This lead to several tours of the U.S. including a couple of trips down to Austin Texas for South by Southwest. They even appeared in a few commercials on MTV2. Hard living and personal tensions lead to some brutal fist fights on stage between band members eventually causing Red Giant to break up in 2006.

The band reunited in 2007 for a series of live shows, leading to a re-activation and the writing of new material. With the addition of drummer Eric Matthews (ex- Pro-Pain, The Spudmonsters) to the line up, the band released "Dysfunctional Majesty" on Small Stone Records Sept. 28, 2010.
