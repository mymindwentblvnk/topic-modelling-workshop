ABOUT KRIVER

Kriver was formed in mid 2009, in Recife, Brazil, when Jahyr Cesar (vocals), Guilherme
Cordasso (bass) and Bruno Oliveira (guitars) decided to stop playing in covers bands and form their own band, where they could finaly express thenselves making their own kind of music. Joinning later the drummer and guitarrist, Ricardo Lira and Thiago Quintino, the group started its activities.
Presenting a Heavy Metal/Hard Rock sound, the band brings back the energy and heavyness that has been forgotten over the technical exhibitionism and free virtuosism.
Kriver proves that it is possible to renew a style, and, with this phylosophy, have been estabilished as one of the most prominents bands of the scene.

ABOUT THE EP TOXIC BLOOD

In July 210 Kriver releases its first EP, called Toxic Blood, it contains 5 songs that reflect their mature and sonorous cohesion acquired from the union of the personality of each member, building a new sound that adding something new to the traditional. The songs: "Toxic Blood" and "Dirty Thoughts" brings us the energy of Hard Rock with the strenght of Heavy Metal; "Whore Love" takes us back to that swing from old 70's bands; "Sorrow", a powerfull ballad, involves the listener with its heavy and depressive sound; lastly, "What is That?", that closes the CD with its striking chorus.
The EP was recorded between February and April 2010 in SalaCinco and Mr. Mouse studios. Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil, Under production of Sergio Kyrillos and Leo D.
