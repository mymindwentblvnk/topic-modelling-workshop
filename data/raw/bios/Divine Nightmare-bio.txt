Divine Nightmare was formed in late 2003 by Jason McMurtrey (Blood Legacy) to convey to the world his ability to write music outside of the doom metal mold. After looking for a singer to fulfill vocal duties he turned to Mark Clausen from the band Long Since Dark. After completing most the work for their debut album 'Sorrows Of Dark' Jason Enlisted brother Jon to do drum duties. The line up now complete Divine Nightmare continues to win fans and forge ahead with a distinct brand of metal music that is filled with melodies and a low growl from the heavy handed guitar playing of Jason McMurtrey. Atmospheric in nature Divine Nightmare is the very essence of the name itself, Living inside haunted, tortured dreams. Jason's songwriting puts you into the emotions and feeling of these nighttime stories with the ease of a blue velvet glove wrapped tight around an iron fist. Divine Nightmare is the full time project of Jason McMurtrey that will always remain true to it's fans and deciples of the dream. Currently the band is writing and ready to record their next nightmare, 'The Cold Light Of Dawn'.
