Chris Barnes has started a new band called iHate, who have released their first song, “Stretcher”. And it’s pretty awful. It’s different from Six Feet Under in that it’s not death n’ roll, but I’m still convinced it warranted a whole new project. But no matter what band released it, it would just bad. It sounds terrible, and it’s just, like, a total parody of death metal. Ugh. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/iHATE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
