Forged out of the icy wilderness of the north, this beast of Helsinki/Philadelphia composes odes of cold subsonics and frigid atmospheres.  Inspired by founder Mika Mage’s Finnish heritage, the band showcases Ambient Black Metal visuals and atmospheres.  Cold, grim, and strangely uplifting, Nihilistinen Barbaarisuus are masters of melancholy...  A must have for fans of Gris, Paysage D’Hiver, Burzum, Velvet Cacoon, Trist, and Neige Et Noirceur. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nihilistinen+Barbaarisuus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
