Excuse for Pain is a death metal band that came into existence through breakup of bands Deaf Auditorium and Theory of Chaos. With ten years of experience and three studio materials with Deaf Auditorium and two with Theory of Chaos, the new band has soon gotten its form and started to make its own songs in old school death metal manner. Six months after the first rehearsal, band released demo recording Designed for Grinding â€“ it contains 10 songs and a video for the song Wrapped in Plastic.
The popularity of band started to rise and soon many concerts all over Croatia took place. 
Early 2008 bass player Marko leaves the band but the very next day Matija takes his place and enters the band.
Only one year after first demo recording, Excuse for Pain returns to the studio to record their second demo Delivering Brutality. New demo album also contains 10 songs of pure and uncompromising death metal. 
Although E.F.P. has finished recording Delivering Brutality 3 months ago, the band is already working on some new stuff. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Excuse+For+Pain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
