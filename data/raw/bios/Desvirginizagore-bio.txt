Desvirginizagore - Death metal band formed at the end of 2008 by Pokegore, Beats of Madness and Nekrogore at the dirty streets of Lima Peru. Looking for a rotten sound and influenced by brutal and sick bands, Desvirginizagore could make the first songs instrumentally, because at that moment the band didn’t have a lead vocalist and a bassist. That’s why the band lacked of Peruvian underground and metal scene for a while.
It is at the end of 2009 and at the beginning of 2010 that Mardak joins the band and then, John Demonio takes the place of the lead singer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Desvirginizagore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
