There are two bands named The Order.

1) Hard Rock/Metal band from Switzerland.
2) RAC/Viking Rock band from Wales. A project of Celtic Warrior's members.


1)Born in Swiss (2004) from an idea of the guitarist Bruno Spring.

During October 2005 they recorded their debut album SON OF ARMAGEDDON at Little Creek Studios in Gelterkinden with GURD Mastermind V.O. Pulver wich was mastered in April 2006 by swiss mastering-guru Glenn Miller at Greenwood-Studios and will see the light of day on June 23rd, 2006 finally through the Hamburg based label Dockyard 1.

But neither expect thrash metal nor mellow alternative rock - these people are in THE ORDER to play a brand of classic Hard Rock and modern Metal.
