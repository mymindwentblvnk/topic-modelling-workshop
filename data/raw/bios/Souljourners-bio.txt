A Southern California band, Souljourners have caught the attention of music fans seeking something new & exciting. The industry should stand to attention when confronted with this group's own brand of progressive metal. Voted the Best Live Band 2007 at the Inland Empire Music Awards. "A band Destined for Stardom" says Martin Brown, Southern California Awards show producer. Known for intense stage presence and musicianship Souljourners has been tearing California open with their unique blend of virtuoso elements and catchy hooks. The band consists of Michael Couts on guitar and vocals, Scoop (David Brockenborough) on bass, Paul Ellingson keyboards and Paul Zimmer on drums. Forget the fact that this is a young group of guys and hold them under the same microscope that you would for Dream Theater, Galactic Cowboys or even Voi Vod - Souljourners will most certainly emerge from the test as true blooded rockers with a sharp mind for progressive arrangements. Souljourners will be touring the U.S. this summer to support their debut album Mind Control produced by Frank Gryner and Karen Stever and which also features Phil Collen, guitarist from Def Leppard, on their song Crazy Times!
