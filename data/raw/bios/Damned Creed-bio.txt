Damned Creed
speed thrash/death metal

Damned Creed was formed in early 2006 in Athens(Greece) by John (guitar) and Fotis (drums).From the first time the band started developing its own songs 
and after several line up changes ended up recording its debut Mini Ep "Dystopia" with John on guitars,Fotis on drums,Alexandros on vocals and Thanassis on bass guitars. "Dystopia" was released in Oktomber 2007 and since then the band is trying to give as many live shows as possible in order to promote its music...
Damned Creed plays a mix of the early day's death metal and furious, agressive, modern thrash.
Although each member of the band comes with an different musical background (from 80's pozer metal to 2000's brutal hardcore) it can be said that Damned Creed's music is mainly influenshed by modern thrash metal bands such as Dew-Scented, Devildriver, The Haunted, The Crown and legendary metal giants like Slayer, Sepultura, Death, Kreator and many others.
