Askival is a one-man Scottish pagan/folk black metal band founded by Tuagh in 2006.

The lyrics dealt with themes such as paganism, ancient Scotland, anti-Christianity and nature.

Askival means "Ash Tree Mountain" in Norse and is the highest mountain on the island of RÃ¹m, Scotland. In 2009 Tuagh abandoned the project due to lack of interest & inspiration for the music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Askival">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
