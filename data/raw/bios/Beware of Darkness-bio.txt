Beware of Darkness is a bold, new power-trio of old souls, pissed at life in a modern age. They are ready to frighten your children, sleep with your daughters, and make you shake, scream, and contort like it's a Depression-Era, Southern exorcism. They play fast moving rock songs with exploding key and rhythm changes mid-song. They also play slow-cooked, sexed-up bluesy things. Imagine Bowie's "Hunky Dory" with low, detuned, primal Zeppelin-esque guitar riffs.

Beware of Darkness is a garage rock band formed in Santa Barbara, CA, USA in 2011 consisting of vocalist/guitarist Kyle Nicolaides, bassist Daniel Curcio, and drummer Tony Cupito.

BEWARE OF DARKNESS released their first full album, Orthodox, on May 7, 2013.
