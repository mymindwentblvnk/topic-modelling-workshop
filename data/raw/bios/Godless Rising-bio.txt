In 2005 a new era of old school death metal has arisen.

Formed by original members of Vital Remains, Jeff Gruslin (vokills) and Paul Flynn (lead guitar), have ignited the metal flame once again.   Now a new era has evolved with the addition of toby knapp writing all the new music for godless rising and jeff gruslin writing all lyrics.

     Ready to bang your head to the pavement once again with a new release stated for the end of 2008 called trumpet of triumph to be released on moribund records. 

"GODLESS RISING"

GODLESS RISINGS music delivers an ear-shattering assault of brutal and aggressive death metal.  And with Jeff Gruslin’s hatred-filled growls and demonic screams of which could only be compared to Lucifer himself, GODLESS RISING will unleash its fury and lay waste to all in its path.
