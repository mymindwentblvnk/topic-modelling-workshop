metal band Automatic Animal has gained a great amount of currency in the past few years carrying on the work that the members started nearly a decade back with Herbert. This is heavy, straight-ahead rockin' metal, nothing ironic or emo about it in the slightest, and is all the more compelling for that. While many are trying to make either overly clever, self-referential metal for hipsters or turning the genre into an over-processed, slick and mechanical affair, the boys in Automatic Animal embrace their hesher roots and tear into beefy, muscular rock that brings to mind both the bluesy squall of Led Zeppelin and the dusted heaviness of Kyuss. It's dirty grindhouse rawk, the kind that will make the weak-blooded blanch at Automatic Animal's full-frontal, four-on-the-floor metal. If you're looking for a damned good excuse to pound some tall cans and bang your head to some prime riffage, Automatic Animal will give you a few. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Automatic+Animal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
