Swedish thrash/death metal act IMPLODE released their first single and video “Stress Communion” on 9th of September, taken from their upcoming album “I of Everything“ to be released in spring 2015. IMPLODE will start a 21 shows European tour with death metal legends ENTOMBED AD and GRAVE on the 4th October. Implode will release single number two taken from their upcoming album in November.

The single “Stress Communion” and the story behind it is a part of a cohesive theme of the coming album "I of Everything", which will bring together the lyrical storytelling with the art made by well-known American artist Caitlin Hackett. “Stress Communion” is about being a single individual trying to achieve happiness and success in a world that offers it all, a society that always demands and standards that no one can reach - this ultimately breaks down the very core of progression and we will all tremble under the stress that burdens us.

Implode singer Johan Ejerblom about the upcoming tour with Entombed AD and Grave:
“ The opportunity to join Entombed A.D and Grave on a tour through Europe is what we all have hoped for, we have a killer record ready to be released and this is the perfect way to ship it!"

Implode released their critical acclaimed debut album “The Hour Has Come” 2011. In 2013 they released the mini album “Under a New Sun” and did a successful European tour together with Rotting Christ, Twilight of The Gods and Negura Bunget. In Sweden Implode shared stage with Amaranthe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Implode">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
