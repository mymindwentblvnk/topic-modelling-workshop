Craig D'Andrea is one of the younger faces you will find on the acoustic guitar scene, but he isn't playing like he's 24 years old. Craig has been receiving support from fans and critics alike since releasing his debut album "Crazy is Catching" on CandyRat Records in March of 2007. The release of his album, along with his title of 2007 Canadian Fingerstyle Champion, has given him the chance to tour in the United States and Canada with respected artists Andy McKee, Don Ross, Antoine Dufour and Peter Ciluzzi.

In the third grade, Craig began his music inclination when he chose to play the cello in his school's orchestra. The cello faded away and was replaced by the baritone ukulele which remained the only instrument in Craig's hands until 1999 when a high school friend introduced him to the acoustic guitar. During his first few years as a guitarist, Craig took basic lessons that allowed him to form his technique and musical style. With the help of his teacher, Craig discovered his main influences such as Lindsay Buckingham, Don Ross and Leo Kottke.

Later in high school, Craig studied classical guitar for three years and planned to attend college to be a classical performance major. After doing well in his auditions, Craig decided to get his degree in Sound Recording and Production from the University of New Haven. The choice not to study guitar allowed him to concentrate his musical efforts towards composing and developing his own sound.

D'Andrea found success in 2006 when he placed third in the Canadian Fingerstyle Championship, and even more, when he took first place in 2007. With the help of his win and a CD that showed promise, Craig was asked to tour with Andy McKee, Don Ross and Antoine Dufour in the United States and Canada
