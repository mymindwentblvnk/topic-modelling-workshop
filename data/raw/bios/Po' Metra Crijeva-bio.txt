Po' Metra Crijeva - Croatian death metal band from Kastav(near Rijeka).

Po' Metra Crijeva translates to "Half meters of colon"

Their songs are funny considering their motto is "death to serious metal".

Music is death metal in nature but they are called as inventors of "ÄŒa Metal" since songs are sung on chakavian dialect(Croatian). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Po%27+Metra+Crijeva">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
