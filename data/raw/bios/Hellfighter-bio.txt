Metal from the black heart of Northern England...

HELLFIGHTER’S origins can be traced back to UK Metal band Xentrix, who were at the forefront of the European thrash metal scene in the 1990s.  They released five albums and toured Europe extensively with bands such as Testament, Sabbat and Tankard, receiving widespread critical acclaim.  They are now acknowledged as one of the foremost British exponents of the Thrash Metal genre.

After a period spent working on different projects ex-Xentrix members, Kristian Havard (guitar), Den Gasser (drums) and Simon Gordon (vocals) reformed in 2007, recruiting Pete Stone (ex Kill II This) and bassist Mel Gasser to complete the line up of HELLFIGHTER.  In 2008/9 the band played a number of UK shows, including the Bloodstock and Metalfest festivals as well as recording a demo, which is still available for streaming on the band’s web site, Hellfighter.co.uk. 

At the end of 2009 the band signed to Heavy Metal Records. The label, which celebrated its 30th year in 2010, has worked with artists like Accept, Diamond Head, Witchfinder General, Paul Di’Anno, Marshall Law and Biomechanical.

Hellfighter's debut album "Damnation’s Wings" had its physical release in Q1 2011 (following a limited period digital release) and is available from Plastic Head in the UK and Europe, MVD in the United States & Canada and worldwide on HMR Digital & iTunes.

Hellfighter have made a number of very well received live appearances in the UK. Their Hammerfest II festival 2010 appearance was warmly received and the band is planning more festival appearances and a tour to promote the "Damnation’s Wings" album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hellfighter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
