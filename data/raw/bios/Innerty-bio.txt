Innerty sees the light of day in January 2003. 
After the departure of their first bass player, the band will play as a trio for a few years before meeting OYC, tour bass player of The Ocean and singer/bass player in several other acts.

Influenced by bands ranging from the devastating chaos of The Dillinger Escape Plan or Sikth, the rythmic creativity of Meshuggah or Tool, to the overwhelming athmospheres of Isis and Neurosis; Innerty shape their very own personnality with a well balanced melting pot of metal, hardcore, jazz, noise, prog rock and electronic ambiant, with solid, complex grooves and structures.

After a good 7 years on the roads, 2 self released EPs and a few compilation appearances (The Apparatus Mecha Organa being the last one), Innerty's first album, Tabula Rasa, was relased in 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Innerty">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
