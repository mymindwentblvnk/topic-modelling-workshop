Survive (often styled S U R V I V E) is an electronic band consisting of Michael Stein, Kyle Dixon, Adam Jones and Mark Donica formed in 2009 in Austin, Texas.

The Austin-based quartet have been producing synth-heavy, horror-score-influenced compositions for almost a decade, exploring these themes through drum machines and analog synths across various single, EP and LP releases and contributions to soundtracks such as acclaimed indie horror film The Guest. More recently the band have been able to gain wider notoriety, after members Dixon & Stein created the original score for popular Netflix series Stranger Things.

Both volumes of the soundtrack were nominated individually for the Best Score Soundtrack Category for the 2017 Grammy Awards, though neither won. 2017 saw Dixon and Stein also nominated for an ASCAP award as a result of their soundtrack work. 2017 has also seen the band curate the music for Sensory, a multi-dimensional immersive restaurant experience' at Sugar Hill Mountain Festival in Melbourne, Australia. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/S+U+R+V+I+V+E">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
