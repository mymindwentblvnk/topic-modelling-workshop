There are multiple artists known as Omnicide:

1) OMNICIDE is an extreme metal band hailing from Bern, Switzerland. In spring 2010, Silvano (Road to Nowehre) decided to form another band to put down his songideas. With Daniel (ex Road to Nowhere) and Markus (Trigger Tones) the Project assumed shape. Reto (Road to Nowhere) was hired to play Bass. Although Songs were there and a Location to jam was found, the 4 realised that they needed a second man on the Guitar. In Mai 2010, Cédric, a friend of the Band was hired as the second Guitarist. In fall, OMNICIDE recorded their first 3 Demo Songs, down in the Trigger Tones-Basement.
First Album "Risen to Ruin" will be released in Summer 2012
