In July 1997, after an accident in a pool he learns he will never be able to walk again. In 1999,after a year of reeducation he can walk again. It is in reference to this experience he has taken the pseudonyme Grand Corps Malade.

His first album, Midi 20, had a lot of coverage and helped the French public discover slam.
Sometimes a capella, often accompanied by a minimalist melody in the background ( which allows for him to accord a bigger place for the depth of his texts), his tracks mix humor, references and poetry. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grand+Corps+Malade">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
