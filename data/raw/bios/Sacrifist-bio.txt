In 1993, Sammy F. Simegi, Michael Kiefer, Paul Verster and Andre Liebenberg formed Sacrifist. SacriFist is a five-piece band from Johannesburg, South Africa who have been active in the metal scene for over 12 years, creating their own brand of Melodic Death Metal.  Over the years the band has seen lineup changes with some members leaving to follow their own paths and other returning with new ideas and skills, but the present line up of Sammy (Guitar), Michael (Drums), Dwayne (Vocals), Tiens (Bass) and Wayne (Guitar) have taken the band to new creative levels.

With 4 full albums and a mini-album in their discography they are planning to release another soon, which promises to be the best SacriFist album so far!

Their powerful melodic death metal has kept their original fans loyal for many years and is constantly gathering an increasing number of new fans. Their songs online have had over a thousand downloads.
