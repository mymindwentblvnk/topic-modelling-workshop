Victoire, a Brooklyn-based band founded by composer Missy Mazzoli, has been dubbed an "all-star, all-female quintet" by Time Out New York. This quirky ensemble combines strings, clarinets, keyboards and lo-fi electronics (including samples of sewing machines and answering machine tapes) to create their "minimalist, post-rock bliss". Victoire is as much a child of composer Philip Glass as of instrumental post-rock ensembles Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and Sigur RÃ³s. They've been making waves in New York's downtown music scene for the past year, performing regularly at The Stone, The CSV Gallery, Galapagos, The Tank, and Space 293. Members of Victoire have performed at BAM, Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and other prestigious venues around the world. Their debut album, Cathedral City, will be released on New Amsterdam Records in fall of 2009.

VICTOIRE IS: Missy Mazzoli, keyboards and compositions, Olivia De Prato and Andie Springer, violins, Eileen Mack, clarinet, Lorna Krier, keyboards, Eleonore Oppenheim, double bass
