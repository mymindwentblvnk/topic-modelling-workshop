PHENIX BIO
My Name is Ricardo Frater , I am 27 yrs old. I was born in Trelawny Jamaica however I grew up  in the small community of Frazers Content in Spanishtown. My Hobbies include  working on car stereos,  teaching swimming and playing soccer.

Growing up in the garrison of  Spanish town writing music and being in the studio was my way keeping myself off the street and away from bad influences. As the years have passed my passion for music has grown.

Performing at school concerts and stage shows in other communities  gave me a greater appreciation for music . I was able to gain inspiration  from other local artists. I hope that through my music I am able to inspire today’s youth  to follow their dreams.

I want my fans to know it take a lot of hard work and  dedication  to achieve their goals. I also want my fans to value education . I have seen first hand how hard it is for parents in Jamaica to send their children to school. So a portion of the proceeds from CD sales is donated  to Open Arms For Jamaica’s Future  a Charity organization that helps send  youth in Jamaica to school by helping  with tuition and school supplies.

Thanks in advance for your support.
