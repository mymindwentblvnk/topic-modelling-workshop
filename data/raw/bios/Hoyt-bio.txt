Hoyt is a Black Metal band from Transylvania, Romania. The name Hoyt derives from the romanian word hoit (carcass, carrion, corpse), the deliberate misspelling is due to the band's personal reasons. 
Hoyt is a self made, self promoting and self-releasing band, a selfish entity with no goals except to make more Black Metal.
