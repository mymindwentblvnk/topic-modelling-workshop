Max Bygraves OBE (born 16 October 1922 - 1st September 2012) in Rotherhithe, London as Walter William Bygraves) is an English singer songwriter, famous for his waving hands. He also appeared on his own television shows, sometimes performing comedy sketches between songs. Shows he presented included the gameshow Family Fortunes.

According to the You Need Hands Songfacts, Max went into showbusiness more or less by accident as a comedy impressionist, but later picked up the basics of songwriting. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Max+Bygraves">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
