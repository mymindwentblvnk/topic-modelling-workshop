WINDFAERER forges a soundscape that entwines elegant beauty with black metal ferocity. Atmospheric, virtuosic violins soar throughout pummeling, metallic intensity. Windfaerer is a portmanteau meaning "one who travels with the wind," like a vessel lost at sea. Lyrically, Windfaerer summons legends of the Iberian peninsula, hearkening the essence of its past.
