Skin Chamber was one of many side projects of Controlled Bleeding members Paul Lemos and Chris Moriarty. Unlike Controlled Bleeding, Skin Chamber had a distinct guitar-based sound that was similar in tone to early Swans (cited by the band as their main influence), the music was also informed by extreme metal and was not dissimilar to the band's other side projects, namely Fat Hacker and Joined At The Head.

The band released two albums: 
Wound (1991)
Trial (1993)
