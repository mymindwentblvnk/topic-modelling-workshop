3rd Born Sun are based in Dundee, Scotland & have been likened to a cross between Crowbar & Black Label Society but in reality have so many more influences than just those two bands. Playing a downtuned, heavy mix of hardcore/sludge/groove metal they stand out in a scene polluted with fashionable screamo/emo style numetal bands. They started out in 2001 with Gavin Rodger on vocals, Stuart Grassie (bass), Arroll Kelly (guitar) and James Watt on drums. Since then, Pete Lowden has taken over the sticks, with a second guitarist added in the shape of big hairy Dave Phillips. This brought a much more extreme styling to some of the bands material & also a more interesting stage presence. Not to mention the potential for drunken antics! The band went on to play numerous gigs gaining a reputation as one of Dundee's best & heaviest live metal bands. Shows were always unpredictable, with wheelie bins, dresses, giant monster costumes, hobby horses (Necro Horse Attack) and the always expected drunken banter! Some of the best & most memorable shows took place in the Balcony Bar in Dundee. Pits smashin up glasses & Arroll putting his foot through the P.A. while playing, gav being debreeked while in fancy dress and the infamous wheelie bin with Gav The Grouch springing out to start the set are just some of the moments that stand out. Songs like Castrol GTX, Kryten Burst A Fitbaw Wi His Heed, Dead On Arrival & Fucking Amigo all stand the test of time & are still remembered by a lot of the older metal crowd in Dundee with fond memories. In later years due to commitments outwith the band for all members, the band went on an extended hiatus but now 4 of the orignal 5 members have started playing again & writing new material. 3rd Born Sun are back & looking for gigs!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/3rd+Born+Sun">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
