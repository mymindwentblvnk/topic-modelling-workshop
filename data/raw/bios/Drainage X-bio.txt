DRAINAGE X started in November of 2002.At the time they lived in Lancaster, CA. The first band line up was ANIMAL, SPIDER, EVIL, and SPACE X. In 2003 they recorded their first E.P. called "BLOOD BATH." After SPACE X tried to kill himself, he quit the band. Then they moved to VEGAS without a drummer. They played their first show in VEGAS using their rodie ZOMBIE WOLF on drums. This didn't work out very well, and, cause of personal problems, he went back to CA. They came to Las Vegas one more time, and met RODENT in the parking lot of CIRCUS CIRCUS, he was a security guard then. Since DX had no rhythm guitar player, and he knew how to play, we asked him if he would join DX. Since he liked Their music so much, he wanted to be apart of it, and agreed to join. They found a drummer named BRODIE, but cause of his addiction to drugs it didn't work out. Then SNAKE joined the band and they recorded "BLOOD ON THE CROSS" In July 2004, they opened the Gathering of the Juggalos. Afterwards, they filmed 2 videos-SPACE ZOMBIE & TWISTED FAITH-at DREAMATION STUDIOS. After 1 1/2 yrs. he quit cause of drugs 3 days before a 26 day PSYCHOPATHIC ALL STAR tour in 2005 with SPIDER on drums and RODENT on bass.` After 2 months, they tried out different drummers, but they were all flakes. They used JOEY from AGE OV REASON to help finish the PAIN album. Released April 2006. Their new drummer WOLF joined the band in March 2006, and they are currently working on THE END OF THE WORLD album.
