AESTEES is a Brutal Death Metal band from the outskirts of West Jakarta formed on 28-May-2010 with the name Sword To Another slain. Consisting of Opik - Vockill, Bebby - Guitar, Ricky - Guitar, Pikar - Bass, Rizal - Drums. Starting from Bebby and Pikar who intend to make a band and finally met Opik. After that, the three of us intend to seek drummer Rizal finally Pikar invite to join and he agreed. A month later go Ricky Mantrysm (Radical Artery) as 2nd Guitar. Our formation was complete. Then in late August, because there is an internal problem we eventually changes its name to AESTEES until now. Our music was turned into a brutal deathmetal and mixed with technical riffs. Our lyrics tend to discuss about gore , mystic, murder, and the Day of Judgement. Our song How To Kill Paranormal (Single) Avaiable. Now we have a song:-How To Kill Paranormal-72 Kepala Tanpa Tubuh-Fatalisme Hari Mati. We hope we can bring underground music to become better.Thanks for all of your support we are nothing without you all guys \m/ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aestees">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
