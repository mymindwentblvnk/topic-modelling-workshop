Lauren Wood (born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) is an American singer-songwriter, voice-over artist and producer. She is most notable for the 1989 single, Fallen, which was used in the 1990 movie Pretty Woman, and Please Don't Leave, a duet with singer Michael McDonald in 1980.

Wood's career began in the mid 70s when she formed a band called Rebecca and the Sunnybrook Farmers. In 1976, Wood and her cousin Novi Novog and Ernie Eremitz formed the band Chunky, Novi and Ernie, which released two albums. In 1979, she went solo and released her self-titled album on Warner Bros. Records, which included the duet Please Don't Leave. The song went to #5 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart and #24 on the Pop Singles chart.

After her follow-up album, Cat Trick, Wood vanished from the music scene. However, she spent time writing and performing songs for television and movie soundtracks, including Fallen, the song used in Pretty Woman, which has been covered by singers such as Johnny Mathis, Larry Coryell, and Nicolette Larson.

In 1998, Wood founded her own record label, Bad Art Records. On this label, she released her third album, Lauren Wood, in 1998 and Love, Death and Customer Service in 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lauren+Wood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
