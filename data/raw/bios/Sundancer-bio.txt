2. Sundancer is the alias of Peter Dani, an upcoming drum and bass producer/dj hailing from Brasov, Romania. Following an early age attraction to music, coupled with a need to get involved, he starts producing experimental trance and techno as a teenager. However, after failing to gain significant attention and grip, he gives up his dream and returns to simply enjoying music.

Two years later, as he attends more and more raves, he discovers drum and bass, which comes to him as a breath of fresh air. This stimulates his creativity and gives him a strong impulse to start producing again. Following that, he also starts collecting and mixing records, mainly liquid dnb. 

Sundancer loves melodic, deep vibes, often spiced up with vocals and ethnic elements. Enthusiastic and highly motivated, he is an upcoming figure in the Romanian drum and bass scene.
