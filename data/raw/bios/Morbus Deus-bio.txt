Formed July 2004 in Westminster, CO with Zach K, and Zach P as "Crown of Aggression". Recorded 3 "rehersal" demos between Novmber 2004 and July 2005. In August 2005, Mitch John and Andrew Ivan were recruited into the group and in Febuary 2006 Morbus Deus recorded a fourth demo. In July 2006 they decided it was time to start over so we changed our name to "Morbus Deus". Morbus Deus has recently finished their first EP - recorded at Flatline Audio of Cephalic Carnage/Throcult with Dave Otero of Dethroned/Serberus and it will be for sale soon.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morbus+Deus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
