Sam Brookes is a British alt-folk singer-songwriter based in London.

After a well-received whistle stop UK tour support slot with Kinks front man Ray Davies, Brookes released his debut single on Helium Records as a solo artist Breathe Me In / In Weeks. Brookes is an accomplished musician and performer with an emerging depth and maturity that increasingly shows in his writing. His finely-crafted songs, immaculate phrasing and beautifully modulated delivery reach easily beneath the skin of his audience. The magical space he creates and the elasticity of his writing and playing have the echoes and jazz arches of giants like John Martyn and Tim Buckley who he includes as his influences along with Scott Matthews, Joni Mitchell, James Taylor and Laura Marling.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sam+Brookes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
