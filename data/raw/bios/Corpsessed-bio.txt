Corpsessed are a death metal band from Järvenpää, Uusimaa, Finland — spawned from putrescent slime in 2007, after the dissolution of an earlier project Skullfucker. They've released a number of EPs and four full-length albums, most recently, Succumb to Rot in 2022.

Vocalist Niko Matilainen (Skullfucker), guitarist Matti Mäkelä (Tyranny, Wormphlegm) and drummer Jussi-Pekka Manner (Skullfucker, Pohjoinen Kuri) were joined by guitarist Jyri Lustig (Cardinals Folly) and (de)composing of morbid death metal tunes began at the rotting houses of Järvenpää delta-area.

The group's original bassplayer Mikko Mäkelä disappeared in unknown circumstances, but was replaced later in 2009 by Mikko Pöllä (Azure).
