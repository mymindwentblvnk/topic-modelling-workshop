Somewhere In Nowhere is simply two lifelong friends, who hail from Florida, that started a small project in 2007 . SiN is Sam "that indie guy," and Adam "the nose with eyes." We have countless inside jokes, as well as the great memories of our youth. Our band has yet to record with professional equipment, so we make do with an acoustic guitar and a Yamaha keyboard. Enjoy our originality. Our taste in music is constantly changing as walk down the lonely, yet crazy, road that is life. Death Cab For Cutie, MGMT, Empire of the Sun, The Postal Service, TV On The Radio, The Beatles, and Passion Pit all have a prolific influence on our musical output. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SOMEWHERE+IN+NOWHERE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
