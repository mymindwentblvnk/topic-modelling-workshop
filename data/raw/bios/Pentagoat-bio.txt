PENTAGOAT is a satanic Death-Metal band from San Diego, California.

After their former bands Uncalledfor and Season of Decay disbanded in 2006, Rany Copeland, Jason Carlson and Jon Clark decided to start PENTAGOAT as a full time band. Jon Clark left the band in early 2009 before the first EP was recorded. 

After William George (Divine Malefaction) was recruited to arrange the keyboard parts, the band recorded their first 6 track self-titled EP which was released in early 2010.

PENTAGOAT plans to record a full length album in mid 2011.
