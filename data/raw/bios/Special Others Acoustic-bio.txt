Special Others have an odd name indeed but it describes them perfectly. Special Others is essentially a jam rock band. While the bandâ€™s use of vocals is fairly minimal and simple, their music consists of instrumental melodies and the like. The guys from Special Others also experiment with improvisation and some pretty creative tempo changes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Special+Others+Acoustic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
