Melancholic Doom-metal in the vein of My Dying Bride. Combines a lot of different elements like violins, flute, female vocals and more. Very atmospheric but also still brutal and heavy - something for Death/Doom fans. Their 2002 release sees them moving more in the direction of pagan/dark metal, and most of the doom/death references of their past sound are lost. 26th January  2013 they had last concert in Ostrava with releasing Time Ruins Also Beauty on LP. After death of main vocalist Ren√© Krystyn in 23rd September 2013, band split up.
