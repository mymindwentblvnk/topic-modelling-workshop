Subarctic Heir is currently made up by two of the three founding members, The Back Witch (vocals) and Sardonicus (all guitars, piano, drum machine and mixing). The Third founding member, Vhyle (drums), departed with the band shortly after formation due to musical differences. Vhyle was accountable for the drums in the song Frost-Forged Rebellion until Sardonicus rewrote them. The band is currently working on a few songs for a demo, hopefully to be released within the next few months. Some of the tracks to be featured on this demo are Frost-Forged Rebellion and Deceased In Living Shock. This band is USBM with Progressive and Thrash influence.
