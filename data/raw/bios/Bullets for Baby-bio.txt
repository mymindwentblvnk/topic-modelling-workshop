The sonic storm, which goes by the name, Bullets for Baby (consisting of ex-Super Zoediac and Caenum members) formed in August of 2005 in a small, dirty, humid basement on the north side of Omaha, Nebraska. While practicing in that same small basement with full-stacks shaking everything that wasn't bolted down and playing the occasional local show (as well as some regional), the band has been causing a lot of buzz in the Omaha metal-music scene with people comparing the band to the sounds of Kyuss and The Sword making new friends and enemies everwhere. In the spring of 2007 they were signed to Des Moines' Mushroom Cloud Records, on which in July of that year their debut album 'The Longest Year'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bullets+For+Baby">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
