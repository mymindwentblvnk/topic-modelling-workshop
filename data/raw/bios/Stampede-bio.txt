1. A NWOBHM band formed in 1981 by song writing duo Reuben and Laurence Archer.  The two had previously made inroads into the NWOBHM movement with Lautrec, Lionheart and Wild Horses and toured with the likes of Def Leppard, Whitesnake and Gary Moore.

In 1982 the band played the prestigious Reading and Mildenhall festivals - material from which was recorded and released as the band’s first album: The Offical Live Bootleg.  During the period of 1981-83 the band recorded their first studio album Hurricane Town with Polydor and also released a 4 track EP:  Days Of Wine And Roses, a single of the same name, and a further two singles; The Other Side and Photographs.

Hurricane Town was fully re-mastered and re-released by Rock Candy Records in 2006 with a 4000 word essay by Malcolm Dome, enhanced original artwork, unpublished photos and 4 bonus tracks from Lautrec (pre Stampede).

Reuben made the decision to reunite the band following the re-release of the Hurricane Town album and due to a keen interest from industry for the band to play UK and international festivals.

2. A Skaband from Utrecht, the Netherlands:
Stampede according to the dictionary:
- a sudden, wild rush of animals stampeding.
- a sudden rush by a lot of people who all want to do the same thing or go to the same place.

Therefore, Stampede is a herd that has broken loose, a description that fits the ska-band from Utrecht, the Netherlands and their supporters to a tee!

Stampede started at the end of 2005, when the guitarist and drummer from former ska-band Tiny Tones decided to form a new band. Soon they found themselves surrounded by a swirling brass section, consisting of trumpet, trombone and saxophone, to be followed by an energetic bass player and a keyboard player to complete the band.

From day one the urge to write new material was the first priority. Although some covers initially filled the play list, self-m tunes ultimately played a greater role in preparing the group to get out there and play. Ever since, Stampede has developed a distinctive sound, exploring the influences of traditional and contemporary ska, as well as embedding different styles of music in the process, resulting in a 5-track demo which was recorded November 2006, and presented at Caf� Havana, Utrecht, January 22, 2007.

In the first performances, the band was warmly received at parties, festivals and clubs, instantly motivating the seven skankers to improve quality, and the development of new material.

This is reflected in a humble appreciation of the (already loyal) followers and friends, jumping and dancing, pushing the band to work even harder, both on and off stage.

Stampede; Stamp Hard!

3. A Stoner/Doom Metal band from Lexington, Kentucky. 

Started in 2010, all the original members remain: Clay Rice, Adrian Dickerson, Teige O'Brien, Andy Hibpshman.

These four guys had already been involved in the Lexington music scene for quite some time, but it is when they started playing together that good things really started to happen. They came from somewhat different musical backgrounds, but they all shared a love for Stoner Metal. The musical result was something more, however, While Stampede has the groove and hook of Stoner Metal, the sound is much more broad. Doom, Death Metal and Progressive Rock are also just as much a part of the music.
Along with other bands in the area, Stampede stimulated rampant growth in the Metal and Extreme Music scene in Lexington, which is gaining momentum every day.

In 2011 they recorded their first album, Stampede.  It has been very well received by listeners.
