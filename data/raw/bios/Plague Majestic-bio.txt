Plague Majestic was formed in 2006 by Set Erixon and Ivar Maelstrom with an aim to create a metal sound equal to the great pneumonic and bubonic plague of the sixth century. Influenced by bands such as At the Gates, Slayer, Deicide, Marduk, to name just a few, Plague Majestic strives to bring out nothing but pure and all eternal blasphemy from the hearts and minds of theyre followers. Nothing have, is or ever will be holy in these dark sermons of truth before and after death. The band had a different line up at start but soon found its right element together with the current members Markus Lundberg, Daniel Melo, Jimmy Lars√©n, Set Erixon and Ivar Maelstrom. Plague Majestic has released a three track promo 06/06/06 and will have the full demo available via myspace and www.plaguemajestic.com very soon.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Plague+Majestic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
