Rising out of the ashes of reunion-era BL'AST and Spaceboy, Gargantula began when Bill Blair (Guitar) gave Clifford (vocals) a tape aptly named the "Infinite Bank of Riffs". Picture a 90 minute tape cassette filled with wall to wall insanity, with no intervals between riffs. Bill and Clifford cherry-picked the choice nuggets out of this batch of music and began piecing together the songs that would become Gargantula. Gargantula played its first show with Vincent's Ear on April 30th, 2003, which was followed by a short west coast tour. Since the formation, Gargantula has been playing constantly, along with bass player Josh Barnett and drummer Chris Gonzales, and has been fortunate enough to play with some incredible bands like Bloodhag, Swarming Hordes, The Whip, Yob, Saros, High on Fire, Dixie Witch, Mastadon, Stovokor, Clouds, Pelican, W.O.W, and the list goes on. Gargantula has recorded its first full-length CD with Billy Anderson at Take Root Studios in San Francisco. The record is named Infinitasm and is currently being distributed by Southern Lord. Make sure to check out the CD and/or come see us when we play at your local club. 10$ to "Gargantula" for CD at 559 Santa Margarita Dr, Aptos, CA 95003 "Gantch" just finished "Tones From The Beforeworld", the latest album translated by Billy Anderson.
