Originally known as Slaves, Pleasure Forever was a rock band on Sub Pop Records. Their music is generally dark, and has a somewhat gothic/cabaret feel. Lyrical content (while heavily distorted on Alter) can be vague but is usually concerned with images of hedonism, lust, weakness of man, death and similar themes. Piano, keyboard and synthesizer are very dominant in their sound as well as very fuzzy, soft guitar sounds.  

With the exception of Sonny Kay, Pleasure Forever features all the members of The VSS. They released two albums, Pleasure Forever, and Alter. The album "Bodies Need Rest" containing cover songs, compilation tracks and songs from an unfinished album was released in 2007.
