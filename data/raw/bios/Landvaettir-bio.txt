Landvaettir is a pagan black metal band from Normandy (France, currently active in Orleans). The band was formed in 2000. The members say they play "Normand Asatrù Pagan Black Metal". The lyrical themes are the glorious past of Normandy and Asatrù religion. The band members are trying to make the Asatrù (old pagan scandinavian religion) a respectable religion and they protect the interests of their land (the unity of Normandy, learning Icelandic language at school, towns signspots written in French-Icelandic display, and the re-establishment of the worship of Asatru).
Etymologically, "landvættir" means spirits guardians of the places, which is also linked with the worship of nature and death. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Landvaettir">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
