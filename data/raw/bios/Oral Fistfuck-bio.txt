Well if the name doesnâ€™t tell you then the music certainly will, Oral Fistfuck are brutal death metal in the extreme. The band who formed in 2005 in Winterthur, Switzerland have been terrorizing the local music scene and creating a lot of noise. Bombastic blast beats, brutal/death styled vocals dripping in venom and guitar riffage that is guaranteed to rip the skin from your ears. Listening to Oral Fistfuck is not for the faint hearted as these guys mean business and that comes through in their music. Lightning fast and devastating everything in its way, so stand back and behold this brutal tidal wave of technical metal.

Ultimately Oral Fistfuck is about brutality, speed, innovation and progress. They have styled themselves on modern technical and brutal death bands without despising the oldschool qualities. Hardcore influences give the fast and brachial sound the necessary groove.

Oral Fistfuck is an amalgam of all of these sounds and styles and this has resulted in what can only be described as technical and brutal death metal from a musical standpoint. Lyrically the band are also quite unique in this genre as they have tended to steer clear of the gore and blood aspects and instead are lyrically fuelled by mysticism and magic from Crowley through to Abramelin, with mantras and the more spiritual side surfacing in the lyrics rather than blood and gore driven subject matter. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ORAL+FISTFUCK">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
