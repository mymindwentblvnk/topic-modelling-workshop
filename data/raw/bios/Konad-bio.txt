KONAD were originally formed back in 1996. Based on their punk/thrash influences, they performed some gigs mostly on the suburban area of Lisbon. After many activity interruptions and line-up changes through the years, the band recorded a demo CD in 2005. Meanwhile, former guitarrist Kláudio and singer Kunha quited the band at the end of 2006. Fortunately, few weeks after, Mikhael (original guitarrist in 1996) re-joined the band and bassist David Karmo was recruited in early 2007. João Litrona takes the other guitar and the (original) drummer Kampino performed the vocals on their DIY DEMO 2007 (recorded in June). The most important things for us are: trying to improve our music and (most of all) express ourselves through punk attitude and punk/metal musical influences.
