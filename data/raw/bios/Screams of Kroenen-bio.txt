Screams of Kroenen originated in Garden City, KS in January of 2007 under the band name “Blunt Force Trauma”. Matt asked around for members of a Metal band and snagged Travis and Jared. They immediately started writing music and in June 2007 Derrick joined the band. SoK (as Blunt Force Trauma) hosted shows in Garden City, traveled for many other shows, and worked hard to try and establish a name for themselves creating friendships with other bands and fans. The band decided that moving to a different city would benefit the band greatly. In Fall of 2009 the whole band moved to Salina Kansas growing closer together as friends and as a band. While in Salina they created another demo and continued to play as many shows as possible. In the Summer of 2011 they decided to change their name to due to other bands sharing the name and wanting one completely original. After changing their name to "Screams of Kroenen" the band recorded an album called “Don't Worry About it Stupid” and released it on iTunes, Amazon, CD Baby, Google Play, and many other online distributors. The band continues to book as many shows as possible and have no plans of stopping. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Screams+of+Kroenen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
