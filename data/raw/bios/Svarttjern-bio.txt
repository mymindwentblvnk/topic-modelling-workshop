Svarttjern was formed late 2003 by HaaN & HansFyrste in Oslo, Norway.



The two brothers played alone for some time until 2004 when they decided to bring more blood to the band. Grimmdun, Fjellnord and Skabb became members, and over the next years two demos were recorded.

Late 2007 Skabb was replaced by Terror, and Svarttjern entered the studio again to record a three track promo. Svarttjern signs with Schwarzdorn Production for their debut album, and entered Strand Studio in Oslo summer 2008.
Over the last two years Svarttjern has done many shows with big bands like Taake and Nattefrost, and gained a respectful reputation within the scene for their brutal live appearances and their misanthropic independence.

Svarttjern's true passion were discovered and granted the TNBM label, and they now represent, from the undergrounds of Oslo, the art of True Norwegian Black Metal with "Misanthropic Path of Madness".

The second album "Towards The Ultimate" is due released 25 Of sept in Europe and 25 Oct in America.
