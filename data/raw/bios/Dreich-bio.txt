Dreich hail from different corners of the globe and were united in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2015.
Dreich is an expression of the suffering of the human condition on this mortal coil. The oath was sworn and the allegiance is kept by four wretched souls brought together by forces unknown to summon: the bleak, the heavy, the horrid, the animalistic and the energy and beauty within darkness.
In sonic ritual Dreich conjure hypnotic rhythms and entrance their fiendish victims.
