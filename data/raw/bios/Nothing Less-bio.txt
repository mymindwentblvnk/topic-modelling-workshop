High energy, catchy hooks and a solid stage show are just a few things Nothing Less fans have come to expect. Over the last five years their sound has developed and matured into their brand of unique, guitar-driven, lyrically intense, hook-laced punk-rock that will have you singing along within seconds.

Nothing Less is no stranger to the music scene. The band has released three full-length albums, lived in three different states (including Alaska), sold over 12,000 records independently, toured through 38 states, destroyed two vans, lived on a tour bus for two months, logged over 30,000 miles on the road, filmed a professional music video, played at world famous CBGB and the Whiskey A-Go-Go, watched themselves on Fuse TV, played nearly all of the Vans Warped Tour, and peed in the MTV studios urinals. Nothing Less has been paying their dues since 2001 and, with each passing day, are seeing their hard work finally starting to pay off. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nothing+Less">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
