INDIGNITY formed in 1995 as a result of the break-up of SILENCEBREAK and anarcho-punks IGNORE. The band impressed right away with their mixture of UK style anarcho-punk and mid-to-full tempo hardcore so typical for the city they come from - Varna, BULGARIA. Their style evolved over the years into a stream of intricate flowing guitar riffs, steamrolling drums and sincere honest lyrics that come from the heart touching all the right subjects. They immediately released a demo tape and started appearing in various shows around the country. 1996 saw the release of a split CS with their sidekicks OUTRAGE. The band played exclusively live shows until 2000 when they were forced by the public to release the "Rehearsal In 33 Studio" CD. The same year they recorded all gathered material and named the CD "1995 - 2000". Other releases INDIGNITY appeared on are the compilations "Varna Hardcore Point Of View" and "Freemind". In 2003 the band was stronger than ever releasing a MCD titled "Your business" and toured the Netherlands, Belgium, Slovenia, Romania and Croatia winning new friends and supporters along the way. INDIGNITY has played shows with the likes of MURPHY'S LAW, BACKFIRE, BOUNZ THE BALL and DO OR DIE. Their best material up to date is released 2005 in the form of the CD called "Hands dripped with blood". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Indignity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
