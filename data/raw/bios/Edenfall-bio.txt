Edenfall are a Gothic Doom band from the heart of England’s past, who emerged from the ashes in the autumn of 2009.

The idea of starting the band grew out of the relationship between the two founding members: Clare Webster (Lead Vocals) and Rob George (Guitar and Vocals) who were both drawn together by a passion for the darker aesthetics of life. Influenced by a range of weeping poets and tortured artists, Edenfall emit a truly melancholic sound that embodies all of the horror and beauty within ourselves, and the world around us.

After a couple of years of pondering the depths of misery, Edenfall released their debut album, ‘Forever Fallen’, in late 2011 which included songs such as ‘An Omen of Sorrow’, ‘In Slumber’ and ‘Beauty’. Following this, Edenfall finally graced the stage in early 2013 and have continued to play live; the line up is completed with the addition of Sean Brazil (Bass Guitar), Marcelo Teixeira (Drums & Percussion) and Steve Mercy (Guitar).

Edenfall have since completed the recording of their second album entitled, ‘Under Sultry Moons and Velvet Skies’. Having signed with independent record label, Ravenheart Music, the album will be released 12th May 2014 with upcoming tour dates in support of the album bringing more doom, misery and tales of witchcraft to the UK! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/EdenFall">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
