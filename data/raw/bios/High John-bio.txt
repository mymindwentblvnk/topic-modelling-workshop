High John is a Montreal-based project that started back in January 2006.
In summer 2005, Ex-CrankShaft Pulley Singer/song writer Eric Mailhot teams with old band mate Rafael DelaDurantaye, to record material for what is now known as the Dead-Bird EP.

The group played actively in and around montreal for about 2 years in about a dozen shows, changing members and playing with many talented musicians along the way.

High John's alternative pop edge has a slight garage sound reminiscent of late 70's goth/punk . The band's percussive, often trance-like melodies are backed by profound lyrics and gloomy vocals, similar to some contemporary stoner/rock acts.
