HELLSCAPE was founded mid-2005 featuring members of german deathers VIOLATION (RIP) and gothic doomsters GARDENS OF GEHENNA.

The music:
HELLSCAPE stands for a modern sort of crossover breaking through common genre limitations by filtering out the essence of all sub styles of heavy music.

What happens:
HELLSCAPE already finished the recording and mixing of their debut album "Downwards". It  will be available in the next few weeks on their offical homepage or myspace presence.
