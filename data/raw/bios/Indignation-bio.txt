Indignation formed under the name Panzer in the Spring of 2009. They are a relatively new band in the Naperville area, consisting of Lauren Gornik (Lead Guitar), Kevin Sandberg (Drums), Andrew Oosterbaan (Vocals/Lead Guitar), and Billy McCartney (Bass Guitar). Indignation plays metal with a wide range of influences from thrash metal to death metal to classic heavy metal. The band recorded a 4-song demo in March of 2010. They are currently working on newer and stronger songs, and are searching for places to play in the area. 
**The band has since changed their name back to Panzer and will be moving this page shortly... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Indignation">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
