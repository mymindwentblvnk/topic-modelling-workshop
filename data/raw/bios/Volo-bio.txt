2. VOLO (Electronic DJ)
"Deeply emotive, his cinematic soundscapes resonate with intense spirituality and creative dexterity. Channeling the old-school electronic aesthetic of Boards of Canada mixed with the contemporary ingenuity of modern-day greats such as ODESZA, VOLO provides a fresh and forward-thinking sound. Embodying the wonder and triumph of Mother Earth, VOLO artfully fuses together world instruments, ethereal soundscapes, and driving synths. In the process, his tracks defy genres and constraints, oscillating between orchestral production, future bass, house, and trip-hop. Carefully crafting intricate layers and textures of sound, VOLO leaves fans discovering new details with every listen. Already collaborating with artists such as CloZee, it will be exciting to see what unfolds in the future as VOLO releases his highly anticipated debut album Live Free."
