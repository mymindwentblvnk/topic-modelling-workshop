Since '97 a display of swedish blackened death metal. Created for the production of sonic terror and to be an outlet of pure aggression. By a constant thirst for innovation, variety and dynamics, the band always tries to seek the unexplored ways of song structure and riffing.

The first audial appearance "Plaguempire" (2005) marked a conclusion of all kinds of setbacks and constant toil. It fed the flame and brought strength and discipline to continue with the creative pains.

Songs have been recorded to follow up the debut. The new album will be released within the year of 2008.
