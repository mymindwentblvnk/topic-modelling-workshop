Rondell Turner, better known as Ron Browz, is hip hop music producer from Harlem, New York City.

Browz started his music career as a rapper for local rap group The Uptown Kidz, when he was 12. He was soon signed to Big Boss Records which happened to get shut down a few years later. The record label left much equipment behind which Browz decided to use as a producer. He taught himself how to produce and his musical sound showed influence from DJ Premier, Pete Rock, Kay Gee and others. In 1998, he got to produce songs for Big L such as "Ebonics" and "Size 'Em Up" starting his official journey through hip hop. A couple years later, he produced the popular song "Ether" for Nas as well as a few other tracks. He soon went on to produce for everyone from Ludacris to Jae Millz allowing him to establish his own record label, Money Ave Entertainment. He has currently finished the work on "After Everything" for Amerie's new album. Ron Browz is also working on a solo venture as an artist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ron+Browz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
