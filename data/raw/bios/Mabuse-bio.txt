Mabuse is a death metal band from Trondheim, Norway.  A three-track demo, apparently titled Stench of Death Tape, was recorded and mixed in January 2012 and released shortly thereafter for free on their official Bandcamp.

The band plays death metal of a thrashy, authentic style, unusual for Norway, and appears to be unsigned. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mabuse">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
