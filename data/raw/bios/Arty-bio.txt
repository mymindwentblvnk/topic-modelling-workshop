Artem Stolyarov, or Arty for short, is one of a rising breed of Russian trance producers now starting to make their mark on the scene.
The Moscow-based producer's tracks pop up all over the place, although it's probably with the succession of vinyl he's delivered on the Anjunabeats label that he's most closely associated.
He began his DJ career in 2009. This year, his clean, uplifting sound has made him new friends in both the pure trance and house fanbases, no small part of which was down to another fan, one Ferry Corsten, picking up on a track he made under another of his alter egos, Alpha 9. He gave 'Come Home' prominent billing close to the start of the first CD of his 'Once Upon A Night' collection back in spring 2010, and that, along with his tireless recording and touring schedule, has certainly helped him leapfrog into the chart.
The next 12 months don't look like being any more relaxed, either.
"I've confirmed remixes for Paul van Dyk, Filo & Peri and Gareth Emery," he tells us. "There will be a lot of new singles and I will also be releasing my cover version of Moby's track 'New York New York' on Spinnin' Records.
Quite what his communist era forefathers would have made of such Western decadence we can only imagine, but we know it will go down a storm with clubbers from the Great Wall of China to the Golden Gate Bridge. Not that his excursions abroad to spread his musical message are restricted to America and Canada - as well as Europe and Australia, he's also lined up to visit Indonesia and India. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arty">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
