Ben Beal started recording and producing music in his Westchester, New York bedroom as a Freshman in high school. His early influences of jazz music became the core sounds of the instrumentals he was creating. He began his musical upbringing working with small, up and coming lo-fi hip hop artists dispersed within the Soundcloud community. His first single distributed as an artist entitled, Never Waking Up, was his first breakout hit which garnered him a growing following on streaming services such as Soundcloud and Spotify. He released his breakout hit song "smile" featuring Sophie Meiers and Nohidea. In 2016, it would gain tens of millions of streams across all major platforms. He released his debut album "Places" on his birthday the summer of 2016 which received critical acclaim worldwide. It was off the growing momentum of his recently released music that he was able to start performing shows around his home turf of New York City. He did various shows in venues such as the notorious Webster Hall. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Beal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
