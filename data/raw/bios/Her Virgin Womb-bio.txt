Formed in 2008 in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from a death metal scene over saturated with pig squeals, sweep arpegios, and chug breakdowns, Her Virgin Womb is striving to bring back the elements of the genre that made it great. With great 90's-style Death Metal influences like Suffocation, Cannibal Corpse, Malevolent Creation, Sinister, and Morbid Angel, they hope to achieve that goal by playing no-nonsense brutal Death Metal the way it was meant to be. Featuring ex-members of premier local and national acts, Her Virgin Womb has an experienced, established, professional, and dedicated lineup ready to do whatever it takes to have their music heard. With a 6-Song CDEP The Methods of Killing (distributed through Sevared Records) released in March of 2010, and non stop live dates through the spring and summer, Her Virgin Womb is a name you won't soon forget...
