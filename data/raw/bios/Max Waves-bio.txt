Check out the new album "Music for Microworlds"!

Born in Treviso in March 1969, at the age of six Max Waves started studying the piano through private lessons, before entering the conservatory "B. Marcello" in Venezia in 1980. 
A lifelong passion for computers and technology in general soon led him to prefer the study of the synthesizer rather than classical exercises to the point where he inevitably abandoned his academic studies and dedicated himself totally to electronic music. 
His production is inspired by Germanic electronic music drawing its influences from artists such as Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Kraftwerk, Peter Baumann although his works also contain echoes of Vangelis, Jean-Michel Jarre, Eddie Jobson, Tomita e Ryuichi Sakamoto. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Max+Waves">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
