In a bid to capture the literal essence of Jack Kerouac's 1962 Novel "Big Sur" in the form a soundtrack;  Jay Farrar (Son Volt, Uncle Tupelo) teamed up with Benjamin Gibbard (Death Cab for Cutie) to create their first studio album "One Fast Move or I'm Gone".

Jay began his solo career in 2001 after long spells in two critically-acclaimed bands and has since worked closely with members of bands: "The Flaming Lips" and "Blood Oranges". Gibbard, best known for his literal song writing and admirer of Kerouac's prolific work, seemed the perfect partner to accompany Farrar. Gibbard made strong references to Kerouac in the track "Bixby Canyon Ridge" taken from Death Cab's 2008 album "Narrow stairs". 
  
The album (released 9th November 2009 on Atlantic) comes accompanied with a documentary-film DVD about the making of the album. The tone throughout the album effortlessly follows the iconic spontaneity of Kerouac's writing style; leading the listener into a mood of  melancholic liberation; care-free but free to care.
