Johnny Mental first came together in September 2002 with the intention of creating a heavy uncompromising sound, intertwined with melodic sensibilities and catchy hooks. Hailing from the South Wales Valleys, Johnny Mental began terrorising local venues and at the end of 2002 a 4 track demo was produced which immediately got great reviews and was even playlisted on the Radio 1 Rock Show and Storm Radio.

2003 saw Johnny Mental continuing their metal assault across all over the UK including a spot on Cardiff's Compass Point Festival sharing the stage with Funeral For A Friend playing to over 2000 people which received a 4K live review from Kerrang. By the end of the year Johnny Mental were ready to return to the studio to record their part of a split EP with Shaped By Fate. Mighty Atom Records asked to release it and the EP went on to receive great reviews from Rock Sound (8/10) and Metal Hammer (7/10) and more airplay on the Radio 1 Rock Show.

Johnny Mental came runners up in Scuzz TV's Demolition Competition to play the Download Festival in 2004. The band were handpicked as finalists by Max Cavalera from Sepultura/Soulfly and Benji from Skindred. As part of the competition Johnny Mental made a music video which received regular rotation on Scuzz TV and the track made a Rock Sound covermount CD.

The bands debut album entitled PINING FOR THE FJORDS which will be released through Hangmans Jokes Recordings is available from August 2006.
