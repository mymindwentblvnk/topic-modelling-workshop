Sadomystic started from a project created between 2005-2006 in the city of Chavantes / SP. The horde was forged through the ashes of an old project created by Funestus called LUX INFERIUM which had a proposal to execute an industrial black metal influenced by Zyklon-b, Mysticum, Lymbonic Art, Satyricon, Samael, Dodheimsgard and others.

In the beginning of 2019 Tanatos left the band. As of February 2019, Satiro is the vocalist of the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sadomystic">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
