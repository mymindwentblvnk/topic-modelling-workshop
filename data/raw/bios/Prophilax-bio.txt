Prophilax is a comedy rock band from Rome, Italy, founded in 1990 by Fabio Pinci (also singer in San Culamo). They enjoyed success among the teenagers of Rome almost immediately for their songs dealt with students and sex. In 1991 and 1992 they produced two demo records of raw energy titled Voci dall'oltrechiavica (Voices from the over-sewer) and Viaggio nella dimensione anale (A journey to the anal dimension) that spread around the young who began to know the band as a good live act. Then they recorded Il signore delle fogne (Lord of the sewers), their most known work. Subsequently they wrote Under Cool (in Romanesco sounds like "in the ass") that came to be recorded professionally in the studios of Toni Armetta in December 1993, but like the others Under Cool wasn't more than a demo. It was censored first by the producers and then by editors, so it was released seven months later, in September 1994. The songs of the first two albums were re-released in higher quality in March 1996 as Nerkiology (something like "Dick-ology").

The first official album was Il quinto escremento (The fifth excrement), recorded at Temple of Noise Studios, produced by Domani musica and distributed by Frontiers Records. The second was a live album called Analive. Prophilax are now working on their new project Coito ergo sum (I have coition therefore I am, a play on "Cogito ergo sum") coming 2008. Prophilax lyrics are very explicit dealing with sex, pornography and common events, using a vulgar language to comic effect.

They participates in the Gods of Demential festival on January 12, 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Prophilax">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
