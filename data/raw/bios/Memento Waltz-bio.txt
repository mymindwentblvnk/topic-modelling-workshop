Memento Waltz is born in Tempio Pausania (Italy) in 1994 as an heavy metal band, but year by year its new influences and its musical growth forged the actual shape: a perfect marriage of psychedelic melodies, dark and introspective atmospheres, polyhedral rhythms and lyrics of dreams and excited mind states, mainly inspired by bands like King Crimson, Ark, Watchtower, but also Spiral Architect and a great variety of jazz-oriented genres. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Memento+Waltz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
