Mike Francis, alias Francesco Puccioni (26.04.1961-30.01.2009), was born at 01:20 on April 26, 1961 in Florence, Italy. The choice of an English stage name comes from Mike's direct contact with American culture.

Right after High School, although he thought of going to university, he began writing seriously his first songs, while at the same time studying composition and arrangement.

Since his first album "Let's not talk about it", including the hit "Survivor", Mike carried through his activity as an author and composer with great success, other than for himself as in "Let Me In", for other artists, in this particular case for Amii Stewart in "Friends" (already on top of both Black American and English charts) and "Together", where he is again author-composer.

The following year, he came out with his second LP, "Features", which shows undoubtedly his musical evolution as well as particular artistic inspiration. Among the ten songs within the album, starting with a prelude, we suggest you listen to "Features of Love" and "You can't get out of my Heart" to better comprehend the progressive growth of his musical personality. This album includes also the hit "Together", and the remake of two old hits "I'm not in Love" by 10 CC and "Lovely Day" by Bill Withers.

"Dusty Road" is another of Mike's great songs. A "Classics" or other greatest hits collections from Mike are also available for those who want to discover the music of this artist who specialized in a melodic and very sophisticated form of dance music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Francis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
