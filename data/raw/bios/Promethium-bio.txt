Promethium is a new metal project made up from members of Skin Crawl, Bodies, Desolate and Natual Thing from Lancaster/Morecambe, England. All of which are already well established and well known bands on the Lancaster / Morecambe Music Scene. They push their own boundaries and push the boundaries of heavy metal music, they create a distincive, exciting sound that people will recognise and enjoy and they do it with skill and organisation. So many people these days preach that heavy metal is dead. Its NOT! Promethium is ready and waiting to prove everybody wrong. 
Influences are any and all types of music from Blues to Jazz to Metal to Swing and everythign inbetween.
