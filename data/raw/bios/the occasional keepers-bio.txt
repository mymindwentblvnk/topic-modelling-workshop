The Occasional Keepers comprise Bobby Wratten (The Field Mice, Northern Picture Library, Trembling Blue Stars) together with Caesar and Carolyn Allen (The Wake), featuring guest appearances from Beth Arzy (Aberdeen, Trembling Blue Stars) and Michael Hiscock (The Field Mice).

The music made by this 'Sarah Records supergroup' is a somewhat meditative, minimalist mix of guitars, keyboards, echoing drums and male and female vocals, set against the background hummings of real places and real times. The songs incorporate a variety of styles, to produce a highly personal synthesis of neo-folk, experimental pop, dissonance, electronics and improvisation.

The 2005 album 'The Beauty of an Empty Vessel' was recorded and produced by Ian Catt (St Etienne) 

Second album 'True North' was released in April 2008, having been written and recorded in just 10 days, and showcases a more song-based approach, while still retaining the experimental touches of its predecessor. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Occasional+Keepers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
