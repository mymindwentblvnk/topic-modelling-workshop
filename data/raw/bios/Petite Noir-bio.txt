After dabbling in metal and chillwave growing up, 24-year-old Cape Town, South Africa artist Yannick Ilunga is now making dramatic, hypnotic pop as Petite Noir.

Two years after his debut single as Petite Noir, “Till We Ghosts”, dropped, Ilunga is heading to London to work on his debut album for Domino in the coming months. This deliberate pace makes sense given his ever-evolving sensibilities, and its allowed him to gather a host of enviable opportunities like opening for Solange in 2013 and even having musical hero Yasiin Bey, aka Mos Def, jump on a remix of "Ghosts". Clearly, Ilunga is on his own schedule, his own path. So far, it’s working. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Petite+Noir">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
