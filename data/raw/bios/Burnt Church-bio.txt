There are two bands with the same name:
1) grindcore band from Halifax, Nova Scotia Canada;
2) black metal band from Rochester, New York, US.

The grindcore band incorporating elements of Sludge, black metal and powerviolence have established themselves as a force to be reckoned with in the international grindcore scene.


The core of the band is made up of guitarist/vocalist Mike Parks (prisoners, sloth, beneath the lies, raygunomics) and drummer Gerald Smith (thy flesh consumed, existench, sloth, gorbage), with bassist Myron Cottreau (Fistfight) and guitarist Dan Jamieson (Thy Flesh Consumed, Sloth, Woehedness) rounding out the group. 

They draw influences from acts such as Discordance Axis, Insect Warfare, Darkthrone, Immortal, DRI, Cryptic Slaughter, Capitalist Casualties, Spazz, Crossed Out, Man is the Bastard, No Comment, Corrupted, Noothgrush, Black Sabbath, Abstain and a million more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/burnt+church">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
