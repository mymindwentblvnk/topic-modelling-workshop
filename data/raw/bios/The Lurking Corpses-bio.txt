In a few words Deathrock, Psychobilly, and Death Metal might begin to describe this band. Only Because of the strong influence of horror on these three genres, there exists considerable overlaps however none of these genres define this band. 
The Lurking Corpses are some other monster altogether. The Flesh of this beast has been fused together with nightmarish stitching and the rotting innards may pay a bit of homage to those of the past. How this monstrosity has been brought to life I can not explain however You have been warned. 
Resurrected from the corpses of Samhain, Misfits, Mercyful Fate
lives a new creature infused with the power of old school death metal. 
No one is safe. Beware The Lurking Corpsesâ€¦..
