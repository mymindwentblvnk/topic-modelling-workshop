Nordjevel was founded in 2015 by Nord and Doedsadmiral after conversations about views, music, black metal and mutual interests in pagan/occult things. They found out they had so much in common, and they thought they should start playing together. Later the idea of this band was aired to Fredrik Widigs, who jumped onboard immediately. However, Nils "Dominator" Fjellstrom took his place and currently continues his work as a drummer.
