The Pagan Metal project of Metatron from The Meads of Asphodel. The Wolves of Avalon is an embodiment of ancient British spirit and pride and not to be confused with any modern interpretation of things long since buried by time and dust. By drafting in James Marinos to create the music and traditional instrumentalist from other bands, Metatron's vision has finally come to life.

The music can be termed Celtic Pagan Metal that simmers in a doleful, almost tragic atmosphere with sporadic up tempo sections to shed light on the Dark Age tale that writhes within. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Wolves+of+Avalon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
