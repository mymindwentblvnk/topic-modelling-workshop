It began in April '04 with the original line up taking musical direction from their idols bands like Pantera, Machine Head, Carnal Forge, Biohazard, Lamb Of God and Pissing Razors to name a few, writing the sort of metal that they themselves would want to listen to. Ventflow have never really been part of a scene, always cited as the underdog, never one to run with the "what's cool now" mentality of today's metal scene. The main idea was simple, to fuse aggressive and extreme heavy music with a ice cold groove. Something to get a crowd moving and energy flowing.

November 2004 the original lineup changed due to musical differences and the original singer left to pursue other musical ventures. Deciding to carry on and look for another vocalist, enter the fold Lee Brennan, cementing the current line up that has stood since November 2004.

Lee Brennan - Vocals
Steve Clarke - Rhythm and Lead Guitar

In writing sessions for almost 6 months creating a new sound, adding new influences and personalities, through good times and bad the four have remained strong, determined, knowing that their music will stand the test of time in a sea of faceless bands with a short shelf life.
