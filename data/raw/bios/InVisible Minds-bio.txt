Revealing the bare essentials, Invisible Minds is an anonymous downtempo/minimal project based in London, United Kingdom. With the release of the track “The Cut Girl (feat. Howard Hobbs)”, the project is almost certain to stir up a ton of questions as to who’s responsible for these soundwaves.

Following the release of hypnotic debut single ‘Yo Mae Leh’, the project has amassed support from outlets like Clash Magazine and BBC Radio tastemakers Tom Ravenscroft, Lauren Laverne and Steve Lamacq. Not to mention grabbing the number 1 slot on the electronic iTunes chart.
