Myone, Myth and Symbolyc One (S1) are Strange Fruit Project. They are three emcees from Waco, Texas who continue to set trends as a not-so-typical southern hip-hop group. S1 does much of the production and directing work for the group's music.

All three members both sing and rap, and their lyrics are influenced by the constant journey of everyday life. In 2004, they debuted with the album Soul Travelin'. This album featured the singles "Luv Is", "Eternally Yours" and "All The Way". "All The Way" was nominated by BBC Radio for 2004 Song of the Year. During 2005, Strange Fruit Project released the single "Milk" with world famous emcee Ghostface Killah, produced by Symbolyc One. This single topped the CMJ college radio charts in July and August of 2005. 

After releasing their debut, they were signed to Om Records. In 2006, they released The Healing. The album featured production from S1, as well as Illmind, Jake One, and 9th Wonder; and featured guest appearances from Erykah Badu, Little Brother, Darien Brockington and Yahzarah. "Soul Clap" was the first single released. 

S1 is currently still doing production work, signing licensing deals for MTV shows such as Run's House, Trippin', and Yo Momma. He has also done some solo and collaborative work.
