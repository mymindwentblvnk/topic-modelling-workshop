It started January 2008 with 5 guys from a place called Os outside Bergen, Norway. The members gathered to make a song for a competition gig, they officially became a band. Months passed, and the band played more local gigs. In september, one of the 2 vocalists was out of the band, and Neo was 4 members. They just recorded 5 songs for their upcoming debut EP "Vol 1. (Death and all it carries)".
