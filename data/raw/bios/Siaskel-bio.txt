Siaskel are a blackened death metal band from Santiago in Chile. Since forming in 2003 Siaskel have released a promo Nar Kra Hohopen in 2010 and a full length in March 2014, Jatenentolpen Thejin.

The band uses Spanish and the 'Ona' language: the language of the Selk'nam, an indigenous people in the Patagonian region of southern Argentina and Chile, including the Tierra del Fuego islands. The people's cultural independence finally got more or less extinct in the middle of the 20th century, caused by the invasion of ethnic Europeans.
