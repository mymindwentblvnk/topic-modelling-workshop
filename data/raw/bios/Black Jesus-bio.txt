There are three artists with the name Black Jesus:

1) Indiana rapper Black Jesus first gained national exposure with his song "What That Thing Smell Like" -- and its accompanying video -- which was popular enough to maintain a nine-month reign on BET's late-night program Un-Cut. The Midwest MC began as a concert promoter in the mid-'90s with his own production company, Scrilla Entertainment. In 2000 he helped form Before and After Records, and the following year Black Jesus became the label's breakout artist with "What That Thing Smell Like.

2) Black Jesus is a metal band from Melbourne with members of Extortion, Fall Out, Delta Reds and Jed Whitey. The band was formed in 2009 out a mutual desire to play crushing riffs and pulverising live shows. Since their inception they have produced a 4 track demo titled "Black Jesus Saves" which has received underground acclaim within the death metal music scene. 

3) Finnish rock band Black Jesus was formed in 2008 in Tampere after Sir Christus was fired from the band Negative. After switching back and forth between the name 'Black Jezus' and 'Black Jesus', they have finally settled on the latter. Currently unsigned, their EP, Catch the Madman, is available free on the band's MySpace page, at http://www.myspace.com/blackjezusband. The current lineup is this (taken from their MySpace): Madbone Macceus - Vox, Sir General Christus - guitar, El Rafaello - guitar, E.Ã…dolf Maniac II- drums, Jimmy Sweat - bass <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Jesus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
