Soulside (or "Soul Side") were a hardcore punk outfit from the greater Washington, D.C. area, formed in spring 1986 and disbanded in summer of 1989. The group disbanded after an extensive European tour and recording the definative Hot Bodi-Gram.The group's sound could be described as clean, heavy, and warm, with lyrics focused on politics. Soulside was one of the first DC bands to bridge the hardcore emo sound of "revolution summer" (see Rites of Spring) and move into a sound of post punk deconstruction. Scott McCloud's SG sound greatly influenced the sound heard from Ian MacKaye's SG in the band Fugazi.

Of Soulside's four members, three (Scott McCloud, Johnny Temple, and Alexis Fleisig) went on to form the post-hardcore band Girls Against Boys at the end of the 1980s. Bobby Sullivan went on to form a band called Seven League Boots, who played a blend of reggae and emo. Afterwards he was involved with Rain Like the Sound of Trains, Sevens, and Spontaneous Earth.

In December 2014 to celebrate the release of the documentary Salad Days http://www.facebook.com/saladdaysdoc about the DC music scene, Soulside will be playing live again for some shows in Washington & New York.
