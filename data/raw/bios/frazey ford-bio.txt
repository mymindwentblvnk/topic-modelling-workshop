Frazey Ford is a Canadian singer-songwriter. She was a founding member of The Be Good Tanyas. Her solo debut Obadiah was released on Nettwerk on July 20, 2010.
Ford cites Rhythm and Blues singers Ann Peebles, Roberta Flack, and Donny Hathaway as influences, and this is evident in her debut album. Jenny Charlesworth of The Georgia Straight wrote that a few of the songs "swing with a mellow neo-soul beat enlivened by buttery vocals". Ford also credits her free spirited parents (her father was an American draft dodger who moved to Canada), and being a mother as strong influences on her songwriting.
Obadiah takes its name from Ford's middle name "Obadiah". When she was born, her parents asked her brothers to choose her middle name; they decided to name her after their pet cat Obadiah that had recently run away.
Ford was raised in the Kootenays in Southeastern British Columbia, and Toronto. She currently resides in Vancouver. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Frazey+Ford">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
