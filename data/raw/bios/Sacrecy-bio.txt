Sacrecy is a young metal band from Finland's Lempäälä. Their style could be labeled as melodic metal with elements from progressive rock and power metal.

Around 2002 Panu Siik and Olli Hipeli had an idea of forming a band. Both being metalheads it was pretty obvious that it would be a metal band. Panu and Olli asked their friend Antti Viitanen to join the band as a bassist.

The band didn't really get any wind beneath its wings until early 2004 when Juho Fabrin joined as a drummer and the band started rehearsing. To ease Panu's guitar work while singing, Heikki Mäkinen from Unseen joined as a rhythm guitarist.

In February 2005 Sacrecy went to Fantom Studio to record a two song promo-cd. Shortly after that Antti Viitanen had to leave the band, Jesse Riikonen soon replacing him.

Sacrecy released their debut album in November 2007.

Soon after the release Heikki Mäkinen decided to leave the band. Eemil Tikanmäki was chosen as the new guitarist and Sacrecy is ready for the future with the current line-up!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sacrecy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
