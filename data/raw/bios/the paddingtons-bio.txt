Comprised of Tom Atkin (vocalist), Martin Hines (guitarist), Josh Hubbard (guitarist); and brothers Lloyd (bassist) and Grant Dobbs (drummer), The Paddingtons were signed by Alan McGee to his Poptones record label. They originally made their name touring in and around the Hull area, at such venues as the Welly Club, the New Adelphi Club, and the Railway pub in Cottingham. Favoured by ex- Libertines frontman Pete Doherty, they toured with his current band Babyshambles. Their debut album, First Comes First, was produced by Owen Morris, producer of Oasis' Definitely Maybe.

In November 2006, they headed out on a small scale national tour to road test new material. They appeared alongside The Cribs at the Birmingham Academy. The Paddingtons have also appeared with Dirty Pretty Things at "The Forum" in May, and again at The Spice Festival at the Hackney Empire in July 2007. On a holiday in Taipei, Carl Barat of Dirty Pretty Things broke his collarbone, so they recruited the help of Hubbard to play guitar while Barat's injury healed.

The Paddingtons are currently touring new material. The band's second album has just been completed and will be released in the near future. The forthcoming album is to be titled No Mundane Options. The first single from the album, "Stand Down", was available for download via iTunes on the Mama Bear Records label, on 4 August 2008.

Plans are in place to do a full u.k tour throughout October and November to coincide with the second single  and album release out on all formats
