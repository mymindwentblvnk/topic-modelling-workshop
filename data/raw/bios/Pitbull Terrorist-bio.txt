Pitbull terrorist is an finnish metal band with an Finnish all-star team. The stars are sort of an secret for they mask themselves with commando-masks and silly artist names like:

Ursula - vocals
John Keu - guitar and vocals
Jorma 22 - bass
Herald Flinck - drums, vocals

But if you know your finnish music you may notice by some little things who are the fuckers behind this load of fullmetalshit.

PBterrorist music is between progressive, metal and grind, or as they self call it, "Grindchaos".



"Pitbull Terrorist is an aggressive, light-speed political agenda to wreck the system of false idealism. The Terrorists are an assembly of real-life, freedom fighters brought together by the hate towards the western world reign today. The political side of the band comprehends most of the deeds and the idealism behind "true" terrorism, accompanying it with auditive propaganda and anti-american cultural revolution."
