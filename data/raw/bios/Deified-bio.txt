Deified are a five-piece metal band from just outside Liverpool. They formed in late 2013. In 2015, Deified won the prestigious Merseyside Metal 2 The Masses competition, where they gained a slot on the New Blood Stage at Bloodstock Festival.

In December 2015, they released their debut album ‘Ascension’ which was entirely self-produced, the album gained some fantastic reviews. This secured a slot in 2016 supporting the likes of Exodus and Cattle Decapitation. Deified have also produced two Music videos during the course of the album ‘Ascension' titled 'No Solitude' and 'Paralyzed'.

In 2016, they were placed 3rd out of 425 bands in a global battle of the bands named the TBFM Factor. Nearing the end of 2016, Pure Power Darkside Management took on Deified to their management roster.

The band started work on their next EP in late 2016 and are currently hard at work, getting all the pieces together for releasing and touring this EP around the country. The first single on this record, 'Ironbird’ should out very soon.
