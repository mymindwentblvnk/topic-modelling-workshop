Real Name: André Tanneberger, Ulrich Pöppelbaum, Woody Van Eyden. Sequential One was started in 1993 by German producer André Tanneberger, getting the name from the Sequential Pro One synthesizer. In 1994 three more members joined: Morpha on vocals, producer Ulrich "Spacekid" Poeppelbaum and Dutch producer Woody van Eyden. Woody and Morpha left in 1998, leaving André and Uli alone. In 1999 the last single was released. As the House Nation label owned the Sequential One name, André and Uli continued the project as SQ-1.
