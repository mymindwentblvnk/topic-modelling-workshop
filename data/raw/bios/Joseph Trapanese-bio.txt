Joseph Trapanese (sometimes referred to as Joe Trapanese) is an American composer, arranger, and producer. He works in the production of music for films, television, records, theater and concerts.

Trapanese collaborated with Daft Punk (Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo) on the soundtracks for the Walt Disney Pictures film Tron: Legacy for two years (from pre-production to completion). His arrangements for the soundtrack have been described as "resolutely grand" and "stirring... ominous, hypnotic". The BBC described the work as "a sophisticated integration of acoustic and electronic instrumentation... majestic… rich, solemn tones… saturnine orchestration and a muscular rhythm”.

Original composition projects include Universal Studios's Straight Outta Compton, Lionsgate Films's The Divergent Series: Insurgent, Sony Pictures Classics' The Raid 2, Universal Studios's Oblivion (co-composed with Anthony Gonzalez of M83), Disney XD's animated series Tron: Uprising, Sony Pictures Classics's The Raid: Redemption (co-composed with Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park), Sony Pictures Television's original web series The Bannen Way, the independent feature Mamitas (featured at the 2011 Los Angeles Film Festival), and numerous scores for live action and animated films from UCLA's School of Theater, Film and Television. Trapanese contributed musical arrangements to Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief, What Happens in Vegas and Traitor. Alongside composer Daniel Licht, Trapanese produced and orchestrated the scores for seasons 3 and 4 of Showtime's original series Dexter, and provided orchestrations for seasons 5 and 6.

The 2012 teaser trailer for Iron Man 3 features Trapanese's composition Something to Fight For. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joseph+Trapanese">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
