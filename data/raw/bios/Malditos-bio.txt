Hailing from Oakland, Ca. Malditos bring together a mix of sounds they refer to as "dark-zone desert psych". Their compositions are dense with pulsating rhythms, melodic vocal phrasings, sonic guitar passages and heavy atmospheric textures conjured via analog synthesizers, tapes and percussion.

Formed in late 2011 for a Halloween performance in the Dismal Swamp, the group immediately recorded material for an album which was released on the their own Alchemy Coffin label. The album features songs with lyrics in French and English as well as a cover of Serge Gainsbourg's classic composition, "Requiem Pour Un Con".
The band features former member of Phantom Limbs, Swann Danger, Heart of Snow, and Los Cincos.
