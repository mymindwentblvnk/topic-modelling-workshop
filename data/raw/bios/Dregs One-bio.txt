Dregs 1 is an emcee, producer, student and community worker from San Francisco. Dregs has always had a passion for art and creative writing. The transition to hip-hop music was natural, and he began writing rhymes and freestyling at 13. Dregs was introduced to studio recording and production through a community center in San Francisco's Mission District. This encounter also inspired his commitment to the Bay Area's non-profit field, where he worked with youth in the community. 

Dregs and three other friends formed a group called Gas Mask Colony. GMC gained a strong following throughout the Bay Area with their energetic live shows. The group also has 2 releases, including the full-length LP 'Genuine Masters of Ceremony,' produced entirely by Dregs. He has also released a popular compilation series, 'Sucka Free State of Mind,' with the fourth volume on its way.

With the spirit of the independent hustle pumping through his soul, Dregs is currently working on a number of different projects. Be it solo albums, mixtapes, projects with Gas Mask Colony, collaborations with different Bay Area artists, or continuing his other creative and community-based endeavors, Dregs has proved to be an up-and-coming force in Bay Area hip-hop.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dregs+One">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
