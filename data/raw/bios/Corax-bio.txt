Official Site


2. South African sludge band. Debut self-titled album available for free download from their Bandcamp site.


3. The band Corax was founded in late 2007 in Cologne, Germany by vocalist Micha van de Weg and guitarist Ltd. Dan. The duo of experienced musicians in their field immediately began writing songs together. The sound of Corax is a blend of low tuned guitar riffs, industrial sample walls, occasional short but finessed guitar solos and very catchy vocal melodies. In early 2008 the duo was joined by bass player Jef van Even. They are currently set out to gather a loyal fan base throughout europe, hoping to get enough radio play to gather some major attention. Once the lineup of the band is complete electrifying live shows can be expected. Stay tuned for Corax. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Corax">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
