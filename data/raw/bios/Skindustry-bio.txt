Forged in St. Louis, Missouri, promising brutality, complex melodies and unstoppable songwriting, this apparatus of iron strength presents itself as Skindustry. This inexhorable monstrosity wields an impressive lineup consisting of none other than vocalist/guitarist John Slaughter (COLDERA), guitarist Clayton Judge, bassist James DeVore, and drummer ADAM SAGAN (COLDERA, ex-INTO ETERNITY). Shortly after laying waste to St. Louis, the band moved on to Orlando, Florida, where they have recruited "The Dark Army".

While launching their debut demo "War Metal" Skindustry's name is being heard across the world like a titanic storm . Listeners of River Front Radio as well as 105.7 "The Point" are hearing the results, as they are able to hear songs like "Wrath of the Ages", which has been featured on Quickstar Productions' metal compilation "Downtown Metal Vol. 5"Â©. Skindustry is sure to provide a huge bench mark in the future of heavy metal music.
