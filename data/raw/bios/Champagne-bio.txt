There are (or have been) at least four different acts called Champagne. As a matter of fact, there were dozens, but we have information on four of them.

1. Established in 1976, Champagne was a Dutch pop group, known as the 'Dutch ABBA' in their day. Brought together by producer, Martin Duiser, the line-up consisted of two men (Bert van der Wiel and Jan Vredenburg) and two women (Trudy Schell and Paulette Bronkhorst). Their first single, 'Rock And Roll Star' (1976), became a smash hit in The Netherlands (#2), Belgium (#1) and Germany (#12). More chart hits followed ('Oh Me, Oh My, Goodbye' and 'Valentino' hitting the Dutch Top-5 in 1977), as well as two studio albums: Champagne (1977) and Rollerball (1979). The group called it a day in April 1981.

2. Champagne is an alias used by Helsinki, Finland-based drum and bass artist, Christian Champagne.

3. Champagne is a Czech 'Euro dance' project by DJ Mysh (Michal Jirak). As Champagne, Mysh enjoyed considerable success in the Czech charts around 1995.

4. Champagne was a short-lived psychedelic rock band from Plymouth, United Kingdom, established in August 1968. They were Terry Ball (lead vocals, guitarist), Greg Vandike (keyboards), Paul Arscott (bass) and Tony Carney (drums). The group recorded a few tracks at an empty Van Dike Club (which was owned by Greg's father, local entrepreneur Peter Vandike), but the songs remained unreleased until they popped up on compilations of sixties psychedelia half a century later. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Champagne">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
