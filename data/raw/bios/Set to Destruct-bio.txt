Set To Destruct is a band from the Reading, PA area. Formed in 2007, it went through several phases of before it became what it is today. Incorporating a mix of thrash metal and grindcore riffs with some brutal death metal vocals, they're able to hold their own when it comes to playing heavy music. Set To Destruct is far from a typical metal band, however. None of that serious "fuck your face with Satan's maggots" stuff, they typically write songs about more important matters, like mad scientists who scrap cars and build robots, badass mother-fuckers who drink PBR and listen to CCR or when doomsday comes and you're forced into your bomb shelter to smoke thousands of pounds of weed. They released their first self distributed EP in June of 2010, which you can currently buy at any of the shows that they play, up until they manage to scrape enough cash together to put out a full length release.
