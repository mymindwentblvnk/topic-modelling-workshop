2) In 1996, at the time of “canned beer high culture”, when the aesthetics of brachial music still sounded from shredded tape decks and men were still men, rose a metal band from the no-man’s-land between Bonn and the Westerwald region – ALCHERA.
Not patched together for the short term, but grown and matured in the band’s very own style, the addiction to speed, pressure and symphonic development connected the band members right from the beginning. The resulting synergy is at the heart of the band, thrashing life back into hung-over Metalheadz with compositional precision and an explosive Molotov cocktail of sound for over a decade now.
Alchera is its own archetype of metal, a hybrid of the brutal twin vocals of the brothers Prangenberg, the dynamic and driving wall of sound by the three guitarists Schulz, Witzmann and Prangenberg as well as the thundering rhythm foundation by Wendt and Pinkert.
The “beast from the Westerwald” takes on ecstatic dimensions especially during live gigs and provides the followers of the metal genre with a fundamental and genuine music experience – unique in style and timeless as a work of art – hand-welded.
“With cleverly structured songs and an irresistible groove this band of six create a dark, outlandish atmosphere in the hall, as only few underground acts I know are capable of.” (LEGACY MAGAZINE)
