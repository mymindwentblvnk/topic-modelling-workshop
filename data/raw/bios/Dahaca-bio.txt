History in a few words...

The band was formed in 2008 in capital city of Poland – Warsaw by two guitarists Vartek 'V' Visznievski, Tomek 'Tom' Jorman and a vocalist – Bartek 'Bart' Morawski.

After few personal changes and splitting-up former projects (i.a. Goddamn) we recruited Marek 'Mark' Wisniewski on drums (2009) and Rafal 'Raf' Szmidt on bass (2010)

to complete the line-up.

We started the intense work on our debut album.

After the recording session vocalist Bart left the band and was soon replaced by Filip 'Filidh' Pikulski.

'The Pure Misanthropy' was released on May 13th 2013.

That year was also a time of first appearance of Dahaca on a large festival stage during Summer Breeze Open Air in Germany.

In the beginning of 2014 the band decided to change the drummer and after few months we recruited Mateusz 'Matt' Kurowski.

Right now we are writing new material for the next album...

Our music is some kind of metal hybrid. Probably the best words describing it are Death Groove.


-The meaning of 'Dahaca':

DAHACA

(pron. da'haka)

Derived from the name Aži Dahāka (Dahāg /Zahhak/), a demonic King Snake/Dragon, according to the ancient Persian mythology...
First mentions can be found in "Avesta" (sacred texts of Zoroastrianism - dated VII BC) and much later in "Shahnameh" - The Book of Kings (dated X AD).

The dominion of Dahaka is the time of grimness and darkness.
It's also an omen of upcoming night and long wintertime.

The original meaning of "Dahaca" remains uncertain...
