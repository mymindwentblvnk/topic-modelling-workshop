LE SUPERHOMARD are a french quintent led by Christophe Vaillant, a musician with a history of mod-styled formations, like the band THE STRAWBERRY SMELL and PONY TAYLOR, and who in 2015 began a solitary project that his brother Olivier later joined and which has continued taking shape to become what it is today (Christophe Vaillant,Julie Big,Benoit Pithon,Laurent Elfassy andThomas Rivello), named in honor of a scene from the movie “Let’s Not Get Angry” by Georges Lautner. Throughout 2017 and 2018 they released a few EPs for the Japanese label Rallye Records and the British label Megadodo. Their music has been played on the BBC by Gideon Coe, Amy Lamé or Stuart Maconie with some very nice columns in the press.
