Francis and the Lights is an American musical project led by Francis Farewell Starlite. The term "and the Lights" refers both to the lights on a stage and pixels on a computer screen.

Francis' music is in the pop / R&B category, characterized by a heavy use of electronically produced beats and melody and live vocal. In live performances, Francis' vocal is backed by his pre-produced tracks with the assistance of a DJ while he uses a synthesizer at times. Francis released his debut studio album, Farewell, Starlite!, on September 24, 2016, and a second album, Just for Us on December 28th, 2017.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Francis+and+the+Lights">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
