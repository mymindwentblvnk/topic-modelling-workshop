Carve was formed in 2002 by members of Sweden’s extreme death metal elite with a line up of Paganizer members vocalist / guitarist Rogga Johansson (Ribspreader, Bloodgut , Demiurg , Paganizer), drummer Mathias Fiebig (Blodsrit and Portal) and Portal guitarist Emil Koveroth and Obscurity bassist Oskar Nilsson. Johansson has also played with Dead Sun, Deranged and used to play drums with black metal band Blodsrit.

Carve recorded the ‘Hunters Rise From Turmoil’ debut demo in 2001. After some months of rehearsing, Carve recorded their brand new 4 track promo demo in 2002.

Not long after that Carve was approached by Brazilian label Black Hole Productions. That label released the first 2 demo’s on one CD as Carve’s debut full length called ‘Stillborn Revelations’.

Carve recorded their second full length ‘Revel In Human Filth’ in 2004 which was produced by Scandinavian death metal master producer Dan Swanö.

Initially the Carve albums were only released in Brazil by Black Hole Records. Vic Records got the rights for the world wide releases. Artwork will be done by no-one less the Hjules (Memory Garden, Annihilator, Gravedigger, Sin of Kain).

Johansson formed with Dea (Another Life) and Dan Swanö (Edge of Sanity, Nightingale) Ribspreader after being a prominent guest musician on the Crimson II album of Edge of Sanity. Johansson formed Demiurg during 2006 and released the Demiurg debut early 2007 on Holland’s Mascot Records which got extremely positive critics and was very well received. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carve">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
