there are two bronzas

one is a juke producer

the other is Bronza, a Croatian Thrash Metal band from Zagreb, formed in September 2010.
The original idea was to perform an old school thrash metal with raw and insane influences. The original lineup was featuring Kosenik on Bass guitar and vocals, TormÃ«ntor on Lead guitar and Kletvenik on drums. Everything seemed alright but Kletvenik's primary weapon was a guitar, not drums. The band had a few gigs covering songs from Slayer, Exodus, Kreator and bands of that genre. In april of 2011 they've met a drummer that goes by the name of Zuh. Zuh played in many bands before, but never quite liked the idea and music the other bands were playing. Very quickly Zuh joined the band and that was a piece that Bronza was missing. The band started writing their own material when Zuh joined the band.
After a year of playing together, Kletvenik was fired from the band due to him not taking the band so seriously. Now Zloba armed himself with a guitar and band found a new bassist that goes by the name of Lucien Morte. Band is currently located in a garage known as Den of Evil and demo is to be recorded very soon.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bronza">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
