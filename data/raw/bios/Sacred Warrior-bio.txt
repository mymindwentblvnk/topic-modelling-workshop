Sacred Warrior hailed from Chicago and were one of the early pioneers in Christian heavy metal.  They played a brand of melodic/slightly progressive metal that showed heavy influence from Metal Church and Queensryche (vocalist Rey Parra sounds remarkably like Geoff Tate).  Other band members (in their final incarnation) were Bruce Swift on guitar Steve Watkins on bass, Tony Velasquez on drums, and Joe Petit on keys.  Other former members were John Johnson on guitar and Rick Macias on keys.  Roger Martinez of Vengeance Rising provided guest vocals on "The Flood" from 1989's "Masterâ€™s Command".

Their studio releases were Rebellion (1988), Master's Command (1989), Wicked Generation (1990) and Obsessions (1991).  A Compilation cd was released in 1993, and much later a live cd, Live at Cornerstone 2001. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sacred+Warrior">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
