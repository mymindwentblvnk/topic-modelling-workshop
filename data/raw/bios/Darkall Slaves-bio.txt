BIO
Darkall Slaves is a Brutal Death Metal band created in 2005 in the north of France (Lille). They've been invited to play such famous Death Metal festivals as Germany’s Death Feast, Ludwigshafen Deathfest, Belgium’s Mass Deathstruction, UK's Bristol Slamfest, Holland’s Neurotic Deathfest official after party (Little Devil), Gothenburg Deathfest, Antwerp Deathfest, Houten Deathfest, or share the stage with their renewed peers (Defeated Sanity, Gorgasm, Centurian, Cerebral Effusion, Kraanium, Wormed, Vital Remains, God Dethroned, Hideous Divinity, Carnivore Diprosopus, Epicardiectomy, Hate, Lividity, Sinister, etc.).

Now signed to Permeated records, Darkall Slaves has released in October 2014 their first full-length “Transcendental State of Absolute Suffering”, an eight tracks bulldozer of massively intense and heavy Brutal Death Metal the US way, featuring Konni (Defeated Sanity) and Matteo (Indecent Excision, Neurogenic) as guest vocalists.
