Dead Man Ray is a Belgian rock band. Among its members are Daan Stuyven, Rudy Trouv√©, Elko Blijweert, Wouter Van Belle and Herman Houbrechts, who was later replaced by drummer Karel De Backer. The band was best known for their experimental way of making rock music: cutting & pasting song fragments next to eachother to produce one song. This methodology was used throughout the first two cd's (Berchem and Trap). For their third LP Dead Man Ray chose to 'renew' their sound and play a song in its entirety without experimenting with it. Their biggest 'hits' were Chemical, Woods and Landslide. 

Their last album (Cago) dates from 2002. This album was recorded in Chicago and produced by Steve Albini.

According to their site, they are holding an introspective break and will restart creativity throughout 2006.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+Man+Ray">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
