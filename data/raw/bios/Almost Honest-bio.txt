Almost Honest, the acoustic soul/pop duo of Drew Orepeza (Vocals) and Justin Florence (Guitar), formed in San Jose, CA in 2008.  Although their name Almost Honest is inspired by the place we  sometimes find ourselves, stuck between the truth and a lie, their music is nothing less than truthful honest talent. Musically they have a great range of influences from Justin’s Rock background to Drew growing up on James Taylor and 90’s R&B artists such as Brian McKnight and Babyface.  Almost Honest’s blend of soulful R&B/Pop vocals over a melodic acoustic guitar gives them a very unique sound that is hard to classify by one particular genre.  <br /><br />

Drew and Justin grew up in San Jose, CA and have both always loved playing and listening to music.  In high school, Justin and his brother started the band My Former Self.  After touring the world with My Former Self, Justin decided to change his musical direction and leave the band.  During that transition he struggled with finding a new project that he was passionate about and even contemplated putting down music all together.  It wasn’t until Justin’s brother, who is a local Bay Area DJ, let him hear Drew’s music. Drew’s heartfelt songwriting and unique vocals were what reignited the fire within Justin to want to work on something fresh and new.  Drew had been working in sales and pursuing music on the side when he created the song “By The Wayside.”  That song along with their similar passion to create music that moves people is what brought them together to form Almost Honest. <br /><br />

The duo immediately began writing together and playing at local coffee shops and festivals.  It was then that they decided to move to Hollywood and pursue music full time.  They have since booked shows at several popular hollywood venues including playing regularly at the Whiskey a Go Go.  They have written over twenty original songs and are currently recording their demo “414 Sessions.”   Almost Honests' talent and passion for music is unique and inspiring.  Their music tells the story of their lives and takes you on an acoustical yet soulful journey that will truthfully move you.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Almost+Honest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
