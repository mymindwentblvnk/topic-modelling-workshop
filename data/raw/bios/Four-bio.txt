1. Four, sometimes reffered to as "The Four" is norwegian band.

2. FOUR is an original Alternative Metal band from Houston, Texas. Founded in 1997, they're setting standards for new heavy music, blending atmospheric moods and raging outburst. Made up of Keith Bracewell on vocals, Mike Haseman on Guitars, Jason Ruff on bass and Brandon Frolick on drums, FOUR brings a new, heavy, low-end sound that does not follow any trends. With an all original set list of over 20 songs, FOUR currently has one of the bigger followings in Houston's local music scene consistently packing local venues such as Fitzgerald's and The Engine Room.  http://www.fourband.com/

3. Four was a staple band of the Denver punk rock scene in the early 90s. Members went on to form other bands such as The Messyhairs and started Paco Garden Records. I can't really remember much else from those days so someone really should add to this!
