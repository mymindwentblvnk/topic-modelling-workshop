Gallia Fornax was a medieval black ambient metal project composed from two members of Triskylaon. However the project had begun solely with Lansquenet in 2005, and he wrote and recorded over 45 minutes of keyboard material for the coming two years. He sent it to Alexandre Julien in February of 2007 to add guitar and bass to it. The Triskalyon group ended in March so this project was aborted, but Lansquenet used some guitar and bass demos on top of only portions of the material, and it was released on Mortification Records as the second demo (the first demo was issued at the same time, of the material that was written in 2005). Lansquenet has since gone on to do Jfod Gumt, while Alexandre Julien continued with Vision Ã‰ternel and Soufferance.
