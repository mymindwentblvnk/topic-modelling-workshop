Spewgore is a speed/thrash metal band based in Brampton, Ontaio Canada. The "band" began in 2003 with Bill Brown on vox and Steve Macpherson on guitars and programming. As a duo we casually recorded our debut CD "Spewgore", released in 2006 on our own Heavil Music label. Mastering was handled by Rob Mills (Razor). In June 2006 Mark Macpherson (drums) and Rob (bass?!) joined the fold. Rob had to leave in September and was replaced by Ken Gibson. This is the same lineup that is still intact to this day! In October 2007 we recorded and released a very limited run EP entitled "If You Know What's Good For You...". The EP contained re-recordings from the first CD, live tracks and a cover of Razor's "Evil Invaders". In May 2008 a new chapter in Spewgoria was written in the form of the full length CD "Chipped Teeth Broken Fingers". Mastering was conquered by GlenDrover (Eidolon, Megadeth, King Diamond). Artwork was created by Felix Laflamme (BW&BK mag). We have played a whack of cool shows with the likes of Anvil, Rammer, Maniac, Piledriver, Estuary, Threat Signal amongst many other wicked acts! There are many more to come. See you at a show somewhere.... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spewgore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
