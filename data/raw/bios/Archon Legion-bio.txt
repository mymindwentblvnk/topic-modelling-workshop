Archon Legion is a four piece metal maelstrom who have all signed their souls in blood upon the Altar of Molten Metal and have been spreading their tainted gospel to the masses since their inception. Releasing their first full length album titled "March of the Inquisitors" in April 2008 and touring relentlessly Archon Legion slays not only Dragons but also every crowd they've ever scorched with their savage guitar licks.
