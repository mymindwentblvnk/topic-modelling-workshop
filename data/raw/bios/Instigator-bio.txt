Jake Setlak (pictured above, listening at United Nations HQ) is Instigator. 
He released "Used Materials" in 2002. 
As well as the companion "Reduced Materials" in 2008.
Plus assorted soundtracks, remixes and mash-ups over the years, as highlighted at noisethrong.com


He is not the shaven-headed dj who started going by the same "Instigator" name in 2004 (mistakenly associated with this profile due to some confusion at last.fm).
