Atra Mors are a United Kingdom based Dark Metal band formed in early 2008, who draw their influences from late 80’s Gothic Rock, and early 90’s Doom Metal, infused with industrial beats and lyrics inspired by Romantic poets such as Byron, Keats, Shelley, Blake, and Coleridge.

The band came together through their connections in the sparse Welsh metal scene, and after several months of back-and-forth communication they entered the studio to record several tracks. Three rough mixes of songs intended for the culminating E.P were released as a streaming demo via the band’s official My Space page and several other profile websites, where they peaked the interests of fans of a variety of different musical genres - the tracks ‘Luna Cry’ and ‘These Forlorn Hours (A Tragedy)’ peaking in the top twenty of the Sound Click ‘Goth Metal’ chart alongside bands such as Inkubus Sukkubus and Draconian. 

Atra Mors’ debut E.P (currently in the final stages of mixing and scheduled for a late 2008 release) is a rich tapestry of  atmospheric hooks, crushing doom-laden riffs, and duel vocals that project the dark and melancholic subjects of the lyrics. 
The E.P contains five tracks that range in sound from the wistfully gloomy to lamenting despair but are all woven together as a collected sound that is uniquely Atra Mors.
