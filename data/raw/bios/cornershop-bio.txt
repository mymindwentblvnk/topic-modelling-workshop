Cornershop is an Indie Rock band formed in 1991 from Leicester, UK, consisting of Tjinder Singh (singer, songwriter, and dholki player), Ben Ayres (guitar, keyboards, and tamboura), Anthony Saffery (sitar, keyboards and harmonium), Nick Simms (drums) and Peter Bengry (percussion).  Most of the original members were also in the Preston band General Havoc.

Their name comes from a term that refers to Indian immigrants that move to England, in that they often own street corner stores. Their music is a fusion of Indian music, British indie rock, and electronic dance.

In 1997, Cornershop shot into the UK charts with the song 'Brimful of Asha' reaching number 60! Things changed when DJ Norman Cook (aka Fatboy Slim) remixed the track for re-release in 1998. The remix topped the chart, selling over 200,000 copies in 7 days! The track featured lyrics about Bollywood playback singer, Asha Bhosle. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cornershop">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
