Toronto/Montreal, Canada (2011 - present)

Based in Toronto and Montreal, Prince Innocence began as a side project of Toronto-based Josh McIntyre, who is also the creative force behind lo-fi post-punk project Little Girls. 

In 2011, McIntyre started experimenting with synth-pop, persuading his girlfriend, Talvi Faustmann (who divides her time between Toronto and Montreal) to contribute vocals. The duo self-released the EP "Night People" online in early 2012. Critical acclaim in blogs and online magazines such as The Fader led to a collaboration with North Carolina rapper Deniro Farrar, with the hip-hop artist rapping over the Prince Innocence song "Girls."

The duo was ranked #8 in NOW Toronto's top 20 reasons to attend the 2012 NXNE festival, as well as playing Pop Montreal the same year.

Prince Innocence signed with start-up Toronto label Pretty Pretty Records, which released the duo's first "official" record, the EP entitled "Lapse," in 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Prince+Innocence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
