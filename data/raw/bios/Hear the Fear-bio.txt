Hear the Fear is a fairly new danish Heavy metal band.

The bands aim isn't to make the most technical, the fastest, nor the heaviest music, but to make metal with balls, heart and soul!
The music is rooted in thrash, yet borrowing from all parts of the metal spectrum.
The band incorporates more rock-orientated sounds into their songwriting, resulting in a number of tracks that most metalheads, even people who normally don't listen to metal will be able to like.
They deliver something rare and organic to a danish scene, that despite its rise in popularity, is alarmingly stagnant in a lot of ways.

The members are very young, all, except guitarist Kristian Jensby, are 17 years of age, yet fill out their places remarkably well.
The rhytm section is controlled by Nikolaj Lauszus, with thrash drumming containing nods towards several other genres.
The other half of the rhythm section is bass player Michael Steffensen, laying a solid ground for the guitar work and vocals, yet also from time to time chipping in small details.
The guitar duties are handled by Christian Skydt Jørgensen and Kristian Jensby.
The lead vocalist in the band is Kim Brandhøj, capable of clean singing, yet mostly using growls, screams and rasps. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hear+The+Fear">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
