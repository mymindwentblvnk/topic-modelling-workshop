Carnal Decay started in 2002 as a sideproject to do some Death Metal. After a couple shows the band flew over to New Jersey to record their first MCD "Carnal Decay" at Rob Grenoble's Watermusic Recorders Studio. Billy Milano (SOD, MOD), right living in the same house, was soon convinced to make the production and mix of two songs for the MCD. 

After a couple line-up changes the band improved a lot and recorded 3 songs for a 3-way split called "Grotesque First Action" with Prejudice (Bel) and Infant Bile (UK) which was released in the end of 2005 through Grotesque Productions (Spain). 

Now, Carnal Decay is coming with their first album "Carnal Pleasures" on Fastbeast Distribution. This 10-track album comes with a brutal sound, guttural vocals and groovy but blasting drums as well. Carnal Decay plays a style related to bands like Gorgasm, old-Dying Fetus or Deeds Of Flesh. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carnal+Decay">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
