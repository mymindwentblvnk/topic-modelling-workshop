There are two artists under the name Jigsaw Torture:

1. An Australian brutal death metal/grindcore band from Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, formed in late 2010. The original line-up included Brendan Hutchinson (vocals), Lucas Ross (guitars), Tyler Clifford (bass) and Taz (drums). The band recorded a 4-track demo in early 2011, passing them out at live gigs.

In mid 2011, lead vocalist Brendan announced his departure from the band, stating the next three live performances would be his last before the band recruited a new vocalist.
