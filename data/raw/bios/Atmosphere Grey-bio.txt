Atmosphere grey was founded in May of 2008 by Jose (Hate) guitar player from Hate in extrema, Rotten minds and Gri-p. He had already composed 5 songs and Alberto ex-guitar player of Hate in extrema thought was a good idea to go on with this proyet. In less than a month the band was getting complete with experience members coming from other bands like Spiritual intervention,Perpetual hate, Hidden,Frozen dawn, Akratos, Sobredosis, etc...In that month the conexion was fucking Brutal and the band stayed together since then.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ATMOSPHERE+GReY">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
