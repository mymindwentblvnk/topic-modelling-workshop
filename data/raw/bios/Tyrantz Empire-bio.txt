Tyrantz Empire started as a two-man Satanic Killing Machine from The Netherlands . The band was founded in the winter of 1999 with the sole purpose of making Black Metal music reminiscent of the 1992 era.

Tarot Productions, the label run by Proscriptor McGovern (a.k.a. Russ R. Givens), leader of the Texas-based mythological occult metal outfit ABSU, announced the signing of Dutch black thrashers TYRANTZ EMPIRE. The band recently completed work on its debut album, "Merauderz of the Monolith – The Omega Chapter," for an October 26, 2010 release. The CD was mixed and mastered at KING DIAMOND ...guitarist Andy La Rocque's Sonic Train studio in Varberg, Sweden. 

Song titles set to appear on the CD include: 

* Under The Chaos Banner 
* M.O.B.K 
* Merauderz Of The Monolith 
* Black Thrash And Beyond 
* Derelict Tyrant Metal 
* Battlesphere Monolith 
* Ancient Tyrantz 
* Galactic Fear Rising 
* Fatal Cosmia Insomnia 
* Starblazed Dagger 
* Rock & Roll Satan 
* Black Bootz Anal Screamer 

The band claims the following: “Our objective is to combine the classic warrior–like sound of black metal (era 1992) riffing with merciless thrash assaults based around 21st century technology. Our lyrics and themes are bound by our surrender to dark energies of anti-cosmic, LSD driven rituals combined with patterns of chaos. This black/thrash conjuration will burn your skin, rape your soul and should take you deep into the sinister evolved regions of the human psyche.”

Visions 
From the ashes of a modern city rises a new Alpha-Breed. They are the products of their enviroment and Beholders of the New World. Our modern way of thinking does not affect our ancient beliefs. The Ancient approach was always in our blood but was confirmed by the ways of Metal. It became our second Nature. We believe we can create our own Order and Empire that stands loose from society through our music. We believe that Nature is our Prime ruler on this Earth and excels through The Will and Strength. We are killing the Boundaries of Pagan culture by integrating them all in our concept, because Nature has no Boundaries or Limits; It is Intelligence known and unknown. Stanley Kubricks Monolith symbolises a New Beginning so we used it into our Art and Concept. It is guiding our Prime Nature, like a Cosmic Antenna. Its Natural Energies are the gift of Satanic Fantasy and Imagination that will be translated through our Art and Music that could be defined as Black Metal.
