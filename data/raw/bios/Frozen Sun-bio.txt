Frozen Sun was an experimental metal band which started in 1995 with former Donor member Jelle Bakker on guitar. He is joined by singer Boris Bouma, JuliÃ«tte van Caspel on bass and Toni van Petten on drums.

The American sound of the band stands out because of a successful, hypnotic combination of metal and electronics, with the absence of guitar solos.

This sound puts the band on the international market which results in tours with The Gathering, Gorefest, Life Of Agony and Fear Factory, among others.

After two successful albums the band split up in 2000. Guitarist Jelle Bakker was part of Within Temptation and Chen Mo for a short while. In 2005 he starts to focus on dance and start the project Extreme II Create. Singer Boris Bouma forms the bands American Murder, but changes that name to Epidemic after the attack on 9/11, and Noise Within in Los Angeles.
