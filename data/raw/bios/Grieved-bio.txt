Five piece hardcore punk band formed in Stockholm, Sweden in 2010 by some Swedes inspired by dark hardcore. With a sound containing both fast, pounding parts and heavy down-tempo sections, and with lyrics ranging from social criticism to self-contempt, these kids play negative but honest music. Ageing is Grieveds first recording and features four desperate tracks. For fans of No Omega, This Gift is a Curse, Jealous, Cursed and Oathbreaker.
