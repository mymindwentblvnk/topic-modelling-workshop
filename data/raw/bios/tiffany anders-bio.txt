Tiffany Anders started her recording career at the tender age of five singing and snickering on art rock band Monitor's record, which also included the Meat Puppets first release. It would be a little while before she would record again, doing background vocals for artists such as Dinosaur Jr., Mike Watt, and Mike Johnson. She first started playing guitar at 14, but it would be several years before she would put a band together to play the songs that she had been working on, finally settling on the name Hot White Noon. Unfortunately, Hot White Noon only recorded one seven inch before disbanding. At that point, Tiffany was still hard at work writing new material for her debut solo e.p. "Running From No Place To Nowhere" which was released to critical acclaim, and found her running in a new direction, a less rock, more folk/country vibe that fit her voice and songwriting so well. After moving to New York city, she continued to work on further material for a full length album. While writing new songs she ran into PJ Harvey and gave her a tape of what she had been doing. PJ liked the material so much that she agreed to produce Tiffany's first full length, and can even be found playing on the record, along with long time friend J Mascis. Tiffany can be found most recently singing on Ted Leo's great new album, Hearts of Oak. Currently, Tiffany is back living in her home town, L.A. where she continues to work on new material with her band Anders and Woods and play live shows as well as curating the live music for the rock film festival "Don't Knock The Rock" which has featured such films as the premier of "MC5 a True Testimonial" and many more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tiffany+Anders">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
