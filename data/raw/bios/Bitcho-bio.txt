Hailing from the southern Lowlands, this Dutch 6-piece is out to make the universe trip on their hypnotic, droning and monotonous grooves. Using 3 bassguitars to pile up low, distorted frequencies as rarely heard these days, analog soundscapes, subsonic drums and intoxicated vocals.

Self-released debut double album 'Toybox' (2009) sold out 200 copies in no time. 
In 2012 Bitcho lets itself drown deeper into the ooze to unleash a new chapter of inertness.
