Third World is a Jamaican reggae group consisting of William 'Bunny Rugs' Clark (vocals), Steven 'Cat' Coore (guitar, cello, harmonica, vocals), Richard 'Richie' Daley (bass, vocals), Herbert Harris (Keyboard), and Tony Williams (drummer).

They were formed in 1973 and are still releasing records today.  Their lineup has changed over the years, as has their musical style, although it has not strayed too far from the "roots reggae" style that they are generally categorized as.

With Dean Pond in the touring lineup (Dean Pond, founder of Dub Mystic and one time musical director and drummer for Culture, and V.I. producer of the year) this year (??) should prove to be even bigger for Third World.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Third+World">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
