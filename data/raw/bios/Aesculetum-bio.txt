Aesculetum was founded in the year 2004 by "Azagtoth" (Benjamin Fischer) and "Ans'gar" (Michael Mander). Their first songs were heavily influenced by Mayhem and Nargaroth, but after a while, "Ans'gar" decided to leave the band because he didn't like Black Metal anymore. He went on to form his solo ambient project "Schattenlychter", which released an album in the year 2005. Meanwhile, Azag'toth had enough songs to record a demo, but he wasn't content with the songs, so the demo was canceled. Around this time, Astaroth (Tobias Zatti) joined the band and they both recorded a rehearsal called Evil Destruction, which contained only Azhubham Haani songs. They wanted to test if they could create the sound Azag'toth searched for. Allthough Evil Destruction is mentioned in the official discography, it was never released, it was accidently spread through filesharing programms. 

Azagtoth wrote new songs, which were recorded at the end of the year 2005, but the songs lacked vocals. Thanks to the label Schlachtenklang Records, they found in Lord Asgoroth a talented vocalist, who recorded the vocal tracks in the beginning of 2007.

The selftitled demo was released in 2007.
