Rising DMV rapper XANMAN has just released his eagerly awaited
new mixtape, l'M A BAD PERSON which includes exclusive features
from NoCap and TisaKorean. I'MA BAD PERSON follows last year's
acclaimed mixtape, BROKEN. BROKEN in turn followed the
breakthrough success of Xanman's viral hit, “Gucci Down." Currently
boasting nearly 7 million worldwide streams and counting and a TikTok
viral moment. In addition, “Gucci Down" was joined by a fiery remix
featuring Rico Nasty and Yung Manny. Hailed by The FADER as “the
D.C. area's most well-rounded newcomer, equally effective at
delivering comedy, horror, and romance," Xanman arrives as a singular
new talent with a scorching signature style. The 19-year-old rapper
mastered ProTools before even hitting his teens, utilizing a $300 mic
gifted to him by his beloved grandmother that he uses to this very day.
He dropped his first mixtape in 2013, kicking off a remarkable prolific
streak that now includes more than 30 unique projects. Pigeons &
Planes decreed him to be “the most quotable new rapper from the
DMV;" while the Washington Post noted how the rapper "refuse(s) to
wait around for the near future, rhyming flagrantly ahead of the beat,
violating temporality and decorum with an absurd amount of style."
“XanMan has become the genre's premier punchline server,"
enthused Pitchfork. "Since the rise of XanMan, rap has been flooded
with imitators attempting to mimic his punched-in flow." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Xanman">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
