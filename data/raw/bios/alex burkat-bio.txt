Somewhere amidst the mean back streets of Philadelphia you might stumble upon Alex Burkat, producer, disc jockey and all round good guy. Across the last four years he has released music on a variety of labels which includes Mister Saturday Night, Permanent Vacation, 100% Silk and Third Ear Recordings. His sound is often aligned with what you might describe as more melodically inclined house and electronic music, his tracks as listenable upon a long walk as they are purpose built for the club. 

As a disc jockey his variation in sound is aspirational, this mix features tracks from Outkast, Atoms For Peace, Roman Flugel and many, many more. A moderately paced mix of eclecticism and sublime taste.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alex+Burkat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
