As Serenity Fades was formed in 1992 in Vantaa, Finland. They played melodic/atmospheric death metal, influenced by the great British acts of the time. The first demo Lowering Sunset was released in 1993. The demo got a good response from the hungry masses who were tired of the "who's the most brutal"-trend that swept the death metal scene of the time. Adipocere Records from France offered a record deal, and the result of the deal was released in 1994 in the form of Earthborn mini-cd. After the mini-cd, As Serenity Fades released a promo tape in 1994 and a demo in 1996 before splitting up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/As+Serenity+Fades">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
