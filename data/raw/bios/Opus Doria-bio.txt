The "Opus Doria project" took life in the fall of 2009, with compositions mixing the lyricism and rigour of classical music and the rhythmic power of metal, and some allusions to epic film music. "Opus" relates to the marking of classical pieces with numbers, as "Doria" stands for the dorian mode to suggest the modal sonorities we find in medieval and baroque music. 
The first point was to compose and build up a coherent repertory, while searching for the right musicians. Those were finally found after several line-up changes, and even if the band is still incomplete today, Opus Doria is on the right path and is fiercely defining its identity: classical and symphonic music combined with powerful riffs from heavy and progressive metal. A powerful lyric voice, the omnipresence of keyboards and cello, the contrast between shadows and light, lyrics inspired with allegory, dreams and spirituality make up Opus Doria’s universe. 

The band is now getting ready to promote its first album „Infraworld“ and looking for concerts...
