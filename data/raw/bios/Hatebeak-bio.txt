Hatebeak is a death metal band from Maryland, USA, formed in 2003 by Blake Harrison (Drums, of Triac and Pig Destroyer), Mark (Bass/Guitars, of Triac) and Waldo (vocals). The band is unique in the metal landscape as Waldo is an African Grey parrot. They also parody other bands in the genre which brings a fun atmosphere to their music.

The band is currently signed to Reptilian Records and has released two split albums with Longmont Potion Castle in 2004 and with Caninus in 2005. The band has also released a split with Birdflesh in 2007.
