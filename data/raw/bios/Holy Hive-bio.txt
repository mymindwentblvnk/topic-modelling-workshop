Brooklyn trio Holy Hive are known for their evocative, genre-crossing blend of throwback soul, folk, funk, and pop. They first garnered attention for their 2019 Harping EP.
Formed in 2015, Holy Hive feature drummer Homer Steinweiss, singer/songwriter Paul Spring, and bassist Joe Harrison. Each of them have carved out their own distinctive musical paths. A sought-after sessions player, Steinweiss has toured with artists like Bruno Mars, Amy Winehouse, Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings, and others. Similarly, Harrison has toured with Charles Bradley and Frank Dukes, while Spring has released his own folk-oriented albums. Steinweiss and Spring initially met several years prior via their girlfriends who are cousins. Discovering their shared musical chemistry, they began working on songs together, eventually bringing bassist Harrison on board. Gigs followed, including a year-long residency at Brooklyn's Sunny's Bar and a 2016 tour alongside Lee Fields. In 2019, they released an EP, Harping, which featured guest spots by Mary Lattimore and Sasami. They returned in 2020 with their full-length debut, Float Back to You, on Big Crown Records. Featured on the album were guest contributions by El Michels Affair's Leon Michels, the Roots trumpeter Dave Guy, the Shacks singer Shannon Wise, and others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Holy+Hive">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
