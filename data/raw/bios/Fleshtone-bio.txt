Portland based Fleshtone is an electronic party of multi-media performers and artists who follow a philosophy of collaboration and shared creative energy.

Fleshtone audiences often find themselves mentally refreshed, inspired, and physically exhausted.

"This is the most rock 'n' roll union of costumes, music, choreography, and nudity since, wellâ€¦ ever... It's a testament to Fleshtone's Freddy Mercury-esque charisma that, amid such ambitious mayhem, she is never dwarfed by her exquisitely costumed companions."--Portland Mercury" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fleshtone">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
