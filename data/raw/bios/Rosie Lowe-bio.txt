Training in jazz, Rosie studied music throughout her education where she moved to London in 2007 to complete a Popular Music degree at Goldsmiths University.

Critics describe Lowe's music as "Effortless R&B beats, experimental electronica, minimalism, the art of understatement."

Towards the end of 2014, she released her 1st single "Water Came Down", and 2nd single "How'd You Like It" from her debut album Control which was released in 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rosie+Lowe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
