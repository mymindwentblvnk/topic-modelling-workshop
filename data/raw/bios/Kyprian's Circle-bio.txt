Kyprian's Circle was a black metal band, formed in 1993, from Lohja, Finland. Lyrical themes include Witchcraft, Anti-Christianity, folklore, and mysticism. Kyprian was the only actual member of the band, other members were session musicians that played on ''Noitatulen Vartija''. Nowadays Kyprian has isolated himself completely from the black metal scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kyprian%27s+Circle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
