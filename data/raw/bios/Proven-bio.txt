Proven was born in the late summer of 2005. As leaders of this new sound, Proven have pounded out some of the most brutal and hard hitting songs of their generation, while encompassing the wide range of influences that they share as a band, and as individuals. They have proven themselves to be warriors of hardcore metal, and have no intention on swaying. You will be entranced by the flickers of technical prowess combined with the raw emotion found in supergroups such as Pantera, Biohazard and In Flames, as these great bands are credited as their greatest influences. Though all members come from different backgrounds, their love and respect for one another is immense and without fail. They stand behind our great country, for better or for worse, and SUPPORT THE AMERICAN TROOPS 100 PERCENT. Surprisingly, with only a handfull of shows under their belt, Proven have built a solid local fanbase and have generated interest from promotion and distribution companies both here in the U.S. and in Europe as well. In early February, 2006, Proven made the cross country journey to record their debut self titled E.P. under the wisdom of Billy Graziadei, and his partner Mike Turner at Underground Sound Studios in South Amboy, New Jersey. Through this, they gained valuable experience and a vision of their role in the evolution of heavy music. Proven's self titled E.P. will hit music stores in the spring of 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Proven">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
