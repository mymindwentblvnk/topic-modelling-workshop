Bells of Doom are a Doom Metal band from Gothenburg, Sweden that formed in 2001. This band is unique because there is only one member, Nicklas Rudolfsson, member of the well known doom metal bands The Funeral Orchestra and Runemagick who plays...well, everything! The band has currently split up, so to speak in this case. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bells+of+Doom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
