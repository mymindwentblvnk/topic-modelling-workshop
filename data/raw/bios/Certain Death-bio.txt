CERTAIN DEATH ARE FROM SOUTH CENTRAL KDY IN FIFE, SCOTLAND. THE BAND ORIGINALY STARTED AS A SIDE PROJECT OF 'THE EXPLOITED' GUITARIST STEED BUT ARE NOW A FULL TIME CONCERN. STEED AND BROTHER JNR THEN WENT TO LOCAL GIGS TO CHERRY PICK THE MEANEST HOMBRES IN THE KINGDOM OF FIFE. WITH TWIN VOCALS OF MURDEROUS INTENSITY ALLIED TO A UNIQUE, HEAVILY RHYTHMIC METAL THE SOUND IS DISTINCTIVE AS A SIGNATURE. THEY RECENTLY PLAYED AS SPECIAL GUESTS AT THE STAVANGER PUNK FESTIVAL IN NORWAY ALONGSIDE SOME GIANTS OF THE PUNK WORLD AND CAUSED SUCH A STIR THAT THEY WERE ASKED TO PLAY THE SECOND NIGHT AS WELL DUE TO POPULAR DEMAND. ON THEIR RETURN THEY DISCOVERED THEY'D BEEN SHORT LISTED FOR ONE OF THE BIGGEST FESTIVALS IN THE UK, T IN THE PARK. THEY BLASTED THEIR WAY THROUGH 700 COMPETITORS TO THE FINAL 12 AND LAID WASTE ON THE FESTIVAL'S NEW TALENT STAGE. THE BAND ARE CURRENTLY RECORDING AND HOPE TO PLAY A TOWN NEAR YOU, BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Copied from their myspace) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Certain+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
