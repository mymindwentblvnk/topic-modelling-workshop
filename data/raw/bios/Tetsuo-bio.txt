There are four Tetsuos.

1. Norwegian electrohouse/whatever-producer, currently signed to Beatuycase Records. Discography includes the 12"s "Disco Team" (Beautycase), "Never Over EP" (Electrobot), "Aftershow" (Betu) and "Plysj Composita" (Betu). Tetsuo also did a remix of That's "A Smart Thing To Say" (Bomb Boutique) and has been featured on several compilations, most recently "International Rekorder". 

Tetsuo started out as an IDM act, but around 2003 he progressed to electropunk and eventually electropop. After a stint in Berlin, his music took a more clubby approach, saving his more song based material for the sideproject Mr. Mushkile.

2. A technical death metal group hailing from Hawley, Pennsylvania. They have currently only released "Malmohrahkign," a 5-track EP. They working on a full length entitled "Syzygy," which has shown more metalcore-ish elements thus far.

3. Tetsuo is also the name of a hardcore band from Murfreesboro, Tennessee.

4. TeTsuo is also the name of a French avangarde / art-pop duo consisting of Arnaud Millan and Alexis Toussaint signed to A Tant Rêver Du Roi.
