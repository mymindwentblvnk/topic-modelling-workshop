Lives of Angels was formed in the 1980s and released one album (Elevator To Eden) on an indie label (Fire) that has subsequently become a minor cult classic in certain circles.
Members Gerald and Catherine O'Connell had previously been members of Mystery Plane.
Musically inactive throughout the 90s, Gerald started recording again in 2001. In 2009, after a 25-year hiatus, Gerald renewed his connection with Mark Harvey of Mystery Plane, resuscitating the  extensive Mystery Plane archive and working on new projects.
The new Lives of Angels material combines the band's 80s approach with an emergent emphasis on electronic and ambient influences. This had always (along with 60s Psychedelia and 70s Krautrock) been a background interest, but the advent of computer technology has made it easier to incorporate into Lives of Angels' 21st century work.
