Darkening is an atmospheric technical melodic death metal band formed on August 1, 2012 in Atlanta, Georgia.

Band Members include:

Jeff Carter: Drums, Vocals, Bass, Guitar, Piano (formerly of The Chariot, Deus Invictus)
Michael Moore: Electric Guitar (studio)
Nich Shacklette: Electric Guitar (Deus Invictus)

After years of gaining experience in countless renowned bands in the heavy music scene, drummer/producer/songwriter Jeff Carter saw the industry fit to receive something more. Taking all of his personal ideas and molding each one into a beautifully complex, dark landscape, his latest project Darkening, was born.

Some bands follow in the wake of others, while still some seem to pioneer but lose the focus needed to continue. Darkening is one of those bands whom will continue pioneering until the band's demise (which does not seem to be soon). From epic song to eerie arrangement, this Atlanta band aims to do something no Atlanta metal band have ever done - pave an entirely new road for extreme metal which is uncompromising, unrelenting, as ethereal, and as brutal as humanly (or inhumanly) possible. Check out Darkening's debut album "Augur!"
