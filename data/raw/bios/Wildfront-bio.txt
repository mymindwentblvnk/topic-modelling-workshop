Based out of Nashville, TN, pop outfit Wildfront is the brainchild of local native, Josephine Moore. 
 
From her early teens, Josephine has been cutting her teeth on coffee shop sets & school talent shows, later breaking into the local music scene as Wildfront. The project has taken many forms over the years, all the while homing in on it’s sound. After flirting with multiple genres and collaborating with various local artists, Josephine has landed with long-time bandmate & producer, BJay Moore (no relation), as her newest partner in forging Wildfront into its purest iteration yet. 
 
Blending bright synths and catchy hooks with hauntingly heartfelt lyrics, the newest Wildfront tunes can be enjoyed whether you’re crying in your room or road tripping to the beach. At times moody & introspective and others, carefree and hopeful, Josephine’s lyrics navigate the choppy waters of lust, love & loss with self-awareness and an eye for detail. BJay lends his skillful ear to elevate the tracks to new heights & fine-tune even the smallest details. Together, they’re creating a Wildfront that’s never been more sure of itself.
