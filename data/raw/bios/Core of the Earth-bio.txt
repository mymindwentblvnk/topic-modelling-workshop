Core of the Earth hails from Colorado, USA, playing a unique mountainous combination of slow as molasses grooves, as well as full throttle punk rock. The band consists of Andy Malishenko on bass, Chris Garrow on guitar and Bailey Cecil on drums/vocals.  The three piece has been together since 1999, playing alongside Jucifer, Weedeater, High on Fire, Thrones, Place of Skulls, Earthride, Meatjack, Black Lamb, and many other local talents. Appearances at 2002â€™s Stoner Hands of Doom Festival in Phoenix, AZ., & the 2003 Spirit Festival in Kansas City, MO. In addition to over 50 local shows in Ft. Collins and Denver covering the span of 2002-04.  

HEAVY is the best adjective to use when describing Core of the Earth.  Reminiscent of Black Sabbath, Melvins, Misfits, Ween and Electric Wizard, their live set is always aimed at flooring the audience with their home-grown sonic thunder-crushing brand of rock music. Bring your earplugs and bang your head to the crust rock that is Core of the Earth.

They have released two albums 'til now:
2004 - Loadstone
2006 - Curtains
