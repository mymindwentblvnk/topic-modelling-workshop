Note: If you are looking for the videogame, please fix your tags, the soundtrack is by Gerard K. Marino, Ron Fish and others. If you are looking for the Thai death metal band see The God of War.

God of War is a technical death metal band from Whittier, CA. Just think Death meets Morbid Angel who then gets kicked in the face by Angelcorpse and you get an idea where this band is coming from. It doesn't get any more brutal or insane than this quartet of sonic mayhem. With a style all their own, God of War continues the tradition of great metal innovators who seek to go above and beyond the current boundaries of speed, power, and technicality.
