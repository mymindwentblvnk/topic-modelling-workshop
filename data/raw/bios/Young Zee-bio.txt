Young Zee is an underground hip-hop artist from Newark, NJ. A long time member of the group Outsidaz, Zee has appeared on various albums since gaining prominence in 1995. After appearing on the soundtrack for the movie, 8 Mile, there were persisting rumours that Zee was to be signed by longtime associate and fellow Outsida, Eminem, to his Shady Records label under Aftermath/Interscope records. These rumours were finally brought to an end when Zee was signed to D12 members Kuniva and Kon Artis' label Runyon Ave. Records.
