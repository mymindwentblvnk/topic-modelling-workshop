Black metal band hailing from Philadelphia, United States. Founded by Maelstrom as a one-piece in mid 2008. Astral Throne recorded two EP's within a year of its conception. After a six month hiatus due to personal reasons, Aavistus (Blasphemous) joined the band on lead guitar. Maelstrom and Aavistus are now in the studio recording the band's first full length, which is near completion and will be released spring 2010. At this point Astral Throne will begin to playing live shows.

All material released by Astral Throne is 100% self produced at their studio in northern Maryland.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Astral+Throne">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
