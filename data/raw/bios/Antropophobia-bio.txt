From Review of "Antropophobia" in Occult Black Metal webzine
"They play a mixture of black and dark metal which they call Luciferian Metal that have also been interviewed by this zine. and this is a review of their 2009 demo .

Drums are mostly slow and midpaced beats with no fast drumming or blast beats, while the keyboards are very dark and tragic sounding, as for the bass playing it is mixed down low in the mix and seems to follow the riffs that are coming out of the guitars and they have a very powerful sound at times.

Rhythm guitars are mostly slow and midpaced riffs that mix dark doom and black metal while the lead guitars are mostly slow and melodic depressive black metal guitar solos.

Vocals are mostly high pitched black metal screams with some spoken word passages, while the lyrics touch on Luciferian philosophies mixed in with alot of depressing themes, as for the production it is very dark sounding which gives the music a very haunting feel and sound."
