Originally formed in 1996 as a ramshackle pop group, Gang Wizard quickly morphed into a collective (ranging in size from as few as 2 people to nearly a dozen) with ever rotating members focused around a few central players. Excluding the early pop group incarnation, Gang Wizard performs song-based improvisation influenced in particular by The Dead C. Recording nearly ever practice and live performance, they have released countless cassettes, 7"s, cdrs, cds, and 12"s. Notable releases include full length albums on Ecstatic Peace ('El Cortez Buy Y' A Drink' / 'Jeckyll Loves Hyde',) Load Records ('Byzantine Headache'), & Deathbomb Arc ('Why Is There A God?' / 'The Atlas of Cancer'). Their most recent full length, 'God-Time-Man Universal Continuum Calibration Disc', came out in 2008 on the heels of a trip to Europe to perform at Fat Cat's Open Circuit Festival. Since this release, Gang Wizard has remained mostly inactive as far as releases and live performance go. The band still records in in a private capacity, headed by the group's founder, Mike Landucci. 

Musicians that have spent significant time in the Gang Wizard collective include members of Foot Village, Eat Skull, Spirit Duplicator, God Willing, Caldera Lakes, Unicorn Hard-On, and Inca Ore.
