Seeking influences from all things groovy and funky, his music touches ground near genres like soul, disco, house, pop and R&B. No matter the style, Reggie delivers tracks and DJ-sets that toes a fine line between the immediate and the challenging, without landing too heavy on either side.

Through releases on Diskorama, NDYD, Paper Recordings, Midnight Riot and VIER he's established a straight up funky sound, bringing his warm and dusty grooves to festivals and clubs in the cold north. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/reggie+got+beats">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
