The Formori are a 4 piece progressive metal band from the small Yorkshire town of Halifax.
Together in the years 2004-2007 they produced a demo EP which featured on the promotional CD in the Jan/Feb issue of 'Zero Tollerance'. Brainchild of the remaining members of the now defunked Blathen Heath, The Formori made a name for themselves delivering steaming live shows in an original style.
Consisting of:
Dave Maclure - Drums
Dave Rawden - Vocals and Rhythm Guitar
Andy Taylor - Lead Guitar and whining
Tom Ellis - Bass and creative direction
