“This band is an island.” Once beneath San Diego, Washington D.C., Chicago; today in the
middle of Berlin, Vallarum or Luxembourg. Ikaria, always being subjected to their own development and change, is grow to its own microcosm, full of thoughts, feelings and character. In the focus, more than ever, a very own blueprint of what some might attach to what they call “pop”, others to what they call “underground culture”. However autarkic, independent and moving in between the borders of the own universe, Ikaria
present themselves on their second full length record. Luxembourg. Isolated in a very tiny Swedish village, the new record develops in Aerosol Grey Machine Studios in January 2010. Initiated by producer Mathias Oldén (Logh), old plans are being dismissed and all songs of the album are recorded live. Luxembourg is the departure of a band towards more immediacy, acuteness and intensity. Luxembourg is raw, direct and authentic. A little treasure, privily hidden among all the others. Ikaria come together in 2006, and after some changes and a stopover in Hamburg arrive in Berlin, where they record their debut Repair My History in 2008 with Thom Kastning (Kate Mosh, Future Fluxus). After eventful months the new album forms within the same year. Luxembourg will be released on 11.06.2010 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ikaria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
