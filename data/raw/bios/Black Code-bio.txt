BLACK CODE is a crust-metal band, formed in February 2011 in Besancon, east of France.

After a CDR-demo in the end of 2011, the first album Lp/CD ''Hanged, Drawn & Quartered'' came out in September 2012. In May 2013, a split Ep 7'' with their friends LUST FOR DEATH (Stenchcore France) is available. Coming soon, a split LP 12'' with UNREST (crust Germany).

They have already played some gigs in France, Switzerland, Belgium, Spain, Austria, UK and Germany... and they are looking for dates anywhere.
