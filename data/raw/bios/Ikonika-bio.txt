Ikonika (real name Sara Abdel-Hamid) is a UK-based electronic musician, producer and DJ often associated with Hyperdub Records and the Dubstep genre.

Her debut 12", "Please/Simulacrum" was released in 2008 on Hyperdub Records. She has released music on Planet Mu, as well as a remix of DJ Mujava’s "Township Funk", released by Warp Records. Ikonika’s music combines melodic synth patterns, driving drums, melancholic sub bass and unorthodox song structures. She was described by The Observer as "a rare female face in the male-dominated world of dubstep, Ikonika melds the genre's juddering bass with Aphex Twin-style melodic mischief-making."

Her debut album, Contact, Love, Want, Have was released on Hyperdub on 6 April 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ikonika">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
