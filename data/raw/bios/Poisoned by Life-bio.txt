Poisoned By Life is a trio from northern New York. Their debut album, The End, was released mid 2014. The band follows a modest, traditional formula, but masters it, blending together only the best monolithic riffs, crushing atmosphere, and unique turns to make for one of the gloomiest albums in the genre. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Poisoned+By+Life">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
