There are two german groups called "Waldschrat"(=wood gnome; streamable tracks here are from band No.1):

1. The folk band was founded in 1994 in Wedel,  a small city near Hamburg. During the next six years two albums ("Lauter niemand" and "nicht zu zimperlich") were released by Waldschrat until they  dissolved in 2000. 

2.Waldschrat  is/was an Upper Franconian Band from Münchberg, founded in 1979/1980. The band is well-known in Franconia for covering popular songs and adding satyrical lyrics in Franconian dialect. They officially split in 2003, but they play one concert each year on first Sunday in September at "Brückleiner Kerwa"
