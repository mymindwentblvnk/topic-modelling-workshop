There is more than one artist with this name:

1. Audiopain was formed in 1996, under the name HÆ?. A total of nine songs were written and recorded and released as the 'LVT' demo in 1998. Musically, the songs ranged from the most raging metal to mellow acoustic songs, from industrial to rock, and just about everything in between. Eventually the music centred around metal, and the name was changed to AUDIOPAIN. Having Performed with bands like 1349, Gorgoroth, Aura Noir, Zyklon, Red Harvest, as well as a couple of metal festivals in Norway, Audiopain has developed a reputation as a live-band. This affects the way songs are written and arranged. Therefore, no overdubs are made in studio that can't be performed live. Focusing entirely on their sole project features only one member in other projects.
