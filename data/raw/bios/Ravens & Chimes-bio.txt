Grown from the halls of NYU, in the midst of one of New York City's harshest winters, Ravens & Chimes debut album, Reichenbach Falls, introduces a youthful, optimistic lightness in the form of a record packed with a series of eclectic and ear-grabbing tunes.  

Perhaps influenced by many a dark, snowy night in that winter of 2005, Ravens & Chimes dig out a catchy set of instrumentally-charged melodies that show their developed blend of unconventional sound.  CMJ called Ravens & Chimes "beautiful" and "unique" evoking comparisons at times to either Wolf Parade or Voxtrot.  

This group of classically trained musicians each bring unique talents to the album. Among the instruments used are the Mandolin, Glockenspiel, Harmonium and a handmade Theremin.  Reichenbach Falls encompasses the raw quality of youth in a split open-heart combination of first lust, disappointment and self-doubt. Songs like ‘St. Jude in the Village' and ‘Eleventh Street' don't push the melodrama of teen angst, but lay out the band's effervescent spirit.
