ABSTINENZ is a Black Metal band and was founded in the winter of 2001 in Bonn (NRW), Germany by Runar (Guitar, Vocals) and M. Lautner (Bass). In the following year T. Wiemann (Guitar, R.I.P), F. Thoelen (Drums) and Herjan (Vocals) completed the band. When M. Lautner left the band, M. Saitova (Bass, Female Vocals) and R. Veit (Synth) refurbished the bands blood. After some Gigs Abstinenz recorded their first, three songs containing demo, which was published on the "Rammbock-Sampler" in 2002. Due to various disputes Drummer Thoelen and guitarist Wiemann left the band. Using a longer creative and human time-out, Abstinenz recorded their first full-length album "Altes Blut" with the following LINE-UP: 

- Herjan (Vocals)
- Runar (Guitar, Bass, Synth, Programming & Backing Vocals)
- M. Saitova (Female Vocals)

M. Saitova left the band. Towards the end of 2007 Shaggnar (Guitar) joined Abstinenz. Shortly thereafter Havoc was integrated as former basser.
