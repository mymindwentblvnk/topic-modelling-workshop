Peter Wolfe (more commonly known as Wolfman) is a London musician of the band Wolfman and the Side-Effects. He is also a friend and the alleged corrupter of Pete Doherty. They also often support Doherty's band, Babyshambles, and used to support The Libertines.

His biggest single, "For Lovers", reached No.7 in the UK charts. Although it was written by Wolfman and Doherty, neither made much revenue from the song's popularity. It did, however, give Wolfe some media attention and increased his fanbase.

A documentary, Wolfman and I, will be released sometime in late 2006/early 2007.

Peter Wolfe met Pete Doherty in Islington in 2001. They formed a relationship ever since mostly based on songwriting. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wolfman">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
