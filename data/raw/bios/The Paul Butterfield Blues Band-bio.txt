The Paul Butterfield Blues Band was an American blues band formed in Chicago, Il, in 1963 by harmonica player and singer Paul Butterfield. Known for combining electric Chicago blues with a rock urgency and for their pioneering jazz fusion performances and recordings, the band signed to Elektra Records after adding Mike Bloomfield as lead guitarist. Their original debut album was scrapped, then re-recorded after the addition of organist Mark Naftalin. Finally, their self-titled debut, The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, was released in 1965. It had an immediate impact, serving as a wakeup call for a generation of musicians. 

The band went on to record several successful albums and was popular on the late-1960s concert and festival circuit, with performances at the Fillmore West, in San Francisco; the Fillmore East, in New York City; the Monterey Pop Festival; and Woodstock. The band split in 1971.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Paul+Butterfield+Blues+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
