Born anew was set up in 2005 by Janek (g) and Piotrek (g). The idea was that the new band had to be female fronted, so Mycha (a girl as you probably guessed) joined their ranks and take care of screaming duties. Since they got what they wanted, the only problem was to find the missing parts what took them a longer while. Meantime they were busy with writing the music as a 3 piece. Finally by 2007 the mission was complete and both bass player Seba and drummer Krzysiek have been found and warmly welcomed in the band. Having called themselves Born Anew, which was forced to be frozen for so long, four guys and one gal were ready to work in full effect to have the demo out as soon as possible. So they did and the the DIY demo was released in March 2008. Since then, BA has played several gigs. The demo was totally sold out, so the band decided to record full-lenght album and entered Mustche Ministry studio in Warsaw. Their first LP is titled "No more days like yesterday" and is expected to be out in March'09. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Born+Anew">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
