Norwegian black/folk metal band Faanefjell have announced the release of their debut album, Trollmarsj, 16th of oktober 2010. Trollmarsj is an concept album with clear references to traditional Norwegian black metal such as Windir, Storm, Ulver and Myrkgrav. The main Trolls of the band, Kim Arly Karlsen (Cutthroat, ex-Rules of Engagement, ex-EON) and danish black metal growler, Benjamin Isar Jørgensen (Grìvf) teamed up early 2009 to write music for their first joint release.

Faanefjell is a Norwegian mountain, and as the story goes, the trolls there were driven away by the humans building their houses and churches. There was an ever ongoing battle between the two on who should have the right, not only to the Faanefjell mountain, but to every Norwegian mountain. Trollmarsj is the story of the mountain, humans, priests, fights and the march of the two trolls, Grimtroll and Sørtroll.

The music could be referenced to as symphonic black metal, and also features guest appearances by Cato Arghamon (Trail of Tears), Ronny Thorsen (Trail of Tears), Frank Ørland (ex-Scariot, ex-Harm), Daniel Sanden-Varg and Audun Grønnestad (Imperia, Angel). The booklet includes the story of the Faanefjell trolls, with lyrics for each song taken from the story. It is written in old Norwegian/Danish language, and translations are available on the bands website in the near future.

Trollmarsj was recorded during the fall/winter 2009 at MayhemMusic (www.mayhem-music.com) in Kristiansand, Norway, and will be available online and in stores 16th of oktober2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Faanefjell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
