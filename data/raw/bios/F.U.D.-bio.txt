F.U.D. was a local cleveland band in the mid nineties. Metal without the metalness. Hardcore without the tough guy attitude. They played a slew of shows in pretty much all of the clubs in Cleveland as well as selling quite a few copies of their independently distributed EP entitled SYSTEM 77(produced by Ben Schigel). The band broke up prior to the release of the much anticipated full length which was to be called "Adverse Reaction".
The SYSTEM 77 EP didn't capture the band at it's maturist state so it is a shame that the full length never got off the ground.

F.U.D. played everywhere from the basement that was Club O'connor....... to the Odeon and Agora etc...........with bands such as Stumbleblock,Urban Assault,Glock Nein,Mushroomhead,Disengage,Six Feet Under,Six Feet Deep,Sacred Reich, and a whole lot more that can't even be bothered to be listed. 


Mike Lemasters went on to drum for the now defunct cleveland band Cold Hand of Christ. 

Matt Ruth is currently went on to play bass for the Posi-Burnouts who broke up in early 2008. Matt and Jim are currently playing together in a band called Dr.Awkwa.rD with ex-Posi Burnouts drummer Jeremy McKeegan.

Jim and Steve have put their project FAIL on hold until a better schedule arises for them. The cd entitled "Humanity has failed" was finally released online in late 2008. 

About once every year there is a rumor that they will get back together for a farewell show and quite possibly record the ADVERSE REACTION full length.....but that remains to be seen.

It was for the love of it. The grime, the dirt, the wastoids, the friends.
