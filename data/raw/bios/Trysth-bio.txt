The purpose of Trysth is to represent a shelter for the musical ideas of a few restless souls. Founded by Assen Santev and Georgi Yoshovski back in 2007, initially Trysth evolved into a black metal project. The year was spent in playing live and recording demo songs, when at the beginning of 2008, the band came to a standstill. At the end of 2011, Yavor Dimov joined the duo and this opened a new page for Trysth. Embracing the sludge/post metal style as a new emotional expression, in the summer of 2012, the band entered Urban House studio to record its first full-length album titled "Soulchambers".
