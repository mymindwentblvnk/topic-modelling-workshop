The beauty of LYON’s infectious brand of synth-pop is rooted in contradiction. Not in the deliberate sense, but in the serendipitous one. 
Described as innocence meets disillusionment and disillusionment meets hope, LYON’s debut EP, Indian Summer, is electronic music with a human soul made by the girl next door with a secret. It wants to say that sometimes you can’t keep the one you have. Sometimes you can’t play out the movie inside your head. In the world of LYON, things don’t happen for a reason but they do naturally and beautifully fall into place.

In the spring of 2013, Lauren Malyon aka LYON signed with Canadian indie label, Black Box Recordings and released her first single, “Indian Summer”, shortly after. Indian Summer hit #1 and #3 in Oct 2013 on the M3 Top 20 and CBC Radio 3, respectively. LYON released her second single “Floating” on Feb 2014 with a video premiere on Noisey and hitting #5 on M3Top20 in Mar 2014. LYON completed a successful national spring tour with Wake Owl including sold out shows in Toronto, Montreal, Calgary, Edmonton, and Victoria. “Lullaby”, LYON’s third and final single from the Indian Summer EP, was released on Sept 10 via Exclaim.

LYON is currently in the studio working on her first full length album with co-collaborators Japeth Maw and Dan Saitua, her band (Dan Saitua, Gary Rugala, Mike Taylor and Michelle Odorico), and producer, Alex Bonenfant. Her lead single, 'Cut Me Loose' was released as a free download on Nov 20th of 2014, with a second single to be released in January 2015 accompanied by an official music video.
