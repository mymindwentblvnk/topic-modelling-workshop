Cheshire has always found his solace in producing electronic music. Starting with dubstep in 2008 he released the number one selling E.P. "Punk" with "Excisions" Rottun Records, gaining a broad recognition within the genre. Over the past seven years he has developed his production techniques and style arriving recently to a point where bass and glitch meet jazz funk and soul. After two years of travelling the world and gathering inspiration, Cheshire has resided in Melbourne to refine his funk infused Latin laced rhythms. Now working with Adapted Records Cheshire has recently released his second EP developing a fast growing following around the world. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cheshire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
