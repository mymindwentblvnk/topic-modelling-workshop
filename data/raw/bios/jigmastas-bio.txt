Whoever loves hip hop and has flipped through cds and LP's is sure to have seen the cover for Jigmastas' 2001 album Infectious - a cover which frames both members of the duo in a pair of headphones to a backdrop of a starry heaven. If you have not actually heard the music but only seen the cover, you are depriving yourself of one of the best examples of what made 90s hip hop great.
Chilled out, spiritual and funky beats of Vince Williams (aka DJ Spinna) are the backdrop to Kriminul's flow and poetic imagery.
