ASKVALD is a one-man-project from Germany/Denmark. After playing and singing in various projects and bands of all kinds of rock and metal music, I decided to finally take things into my own hands during the 
year of 2013. Based on new and old material and ideas I recorded a 3-song demo 
called "Fernab des Weges", wich was self-released in the midst of 2014. 
With its somehow unique personality, it quickly became an emotional guideline 
for the writing and composing of the planned album. The style of my project is 
hard to describe for me. It is definitely influenced by bands such as Woods of Ypres, 
Sorgsvart, Crematory, Nocte Obducta and Khors - melodic, rough till emotional Black Metal, 
theme inspired by nature, society and personal conflicts and experiences.
