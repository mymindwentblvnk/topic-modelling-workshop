// the atmosphere is raw, dark and vibrating and the songs often deal with the gloominess that is buried in the young human heart. It is white-dark noise pop wrapped in a simple lo-fi form. The inspiration can be seen in the late psyched 60s and the early/late black 80s. With a clattering spaceguitar, a riding bass, a dirty beat and a dark/strident vocal, Shiny Darkly is a band that wants to embrace you with noise and love // 

Selftitled debut EP "Shiny Darkly" released in May 2012 on Crunchy Frog.
