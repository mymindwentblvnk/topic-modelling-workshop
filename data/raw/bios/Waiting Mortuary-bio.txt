Waiting Mortuary spawned in the earlier part of 2008 in Fecal(VA) Beach, VA. Rising out of the ashes of the defunct Holy Fuck. Members are Terry Steel, vocals, Ryan Anderson, guitar, Anthony Gadzalski, bass, and Andrew Bancroft, drums. Playing a distorted blend of blackened death metal and all things extreme, this power house has already released their demo release "Heaven's Descent Unto Ashes" out of their own freewill, with a limited edition, bloody pink cassette version available from Last Anthem Records.  Set out on The Wife Beat-Tour in January 09 with friends in filth Call the Paramedics, the plague has begun to spread throughout the country.  In such a short time Waiting Mortuary has shared the stage with such acts as Dying Fetus, Napalm Death, Suffocation, Origin, Distorted Impalement, Splitter, War From a Harlots Mouth, Goat Whore, and many others. No signs of slowing for these tyrants any time soon, so keep your ears open and your horns raised. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Waiting+Mortuary">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
