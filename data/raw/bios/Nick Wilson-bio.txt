From his first recordings Nick Wilson was moving with momentum. The English songwriter seemed to implicitly grasp where he was travelling to, crafting beautiful, soft-hewn nuggets, blissful acoustic melodies wrapped around pearls of wisdom. With five EP’s and over 100 million streams under his belt, 2021 sees Nick releasing something bigger. His debut album – defiantly crafted during lockdown – is his boldest statement yet, and it could well be his most affecting, and profound. 

Gorgeous, gilded songwriting, Nick Wilson’s work is worth aligning next to Bon Iver or Ben Howard, with elements of Phoebe Bridgers’ emotional heft in there, too. As Nick puts it, he’s infatuated by the craft of songwriting. “The lovely thing about it,” he insists, “is that you can have these little pockets of space to play around in, but then you can do things really quickly off the back of them because they’re not quite tied in together. They can be separate things.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nick+Wilson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
