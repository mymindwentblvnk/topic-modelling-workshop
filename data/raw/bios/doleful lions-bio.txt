Formed in Chicago during the mid-1990s by singer/guitarist Jonathan Scott (Cinco De Gatos), the indie-pop unit the Doleful Lions soon relocated to Chapel Hill, North Carolina. There the group — which also included Scott's brother Robert on bass, guitarist Joe Caparo and drummer Tony Stiglitz — hooked up with noted producer Mitch Easter, who agreed to helm their 1998 debut Motel Swim, with additional recording by Chris Stamey. Robert Scott left the Doleful Lions a short time later, and was soon replaced by bassist Amy Palazzolo. The Rats Are Coming! The Werewolves Are Here! followed in 1999. The unusual Song Cyclops was released in 2000, unveiling another batch of B-movie power pop that found the band singing about witches and Sasquatches. The poppier Out Like a Lamb followed two years later, and Shaded Lodge and Mausoleum landed in 2005, followed by Song Cyclops Volume Two in 2006 and 7 in 2008. Let's Break Bobby Beausoleil Out Of Prison! was recorded in 2010-2011 and remains unreleased, although you can download it for free on Last.fm and Bandcamp.

Jonathan and his brother Robert have started recording a follow up to "Let's Break Bobby Beausoleil Out Of Prison!" and will be released in 2015. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Doleful+Lions">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
