Militia Prima is a Thrash Metal band from Nieuwegein and IJsselstein, the Netherlands.

The band has a total of 5 members:
- Jasper, with his vocal cords of doom, 
- Patrick, picking his strings as the Lead guitar player, 
- Niels, accompanying Patrick with his skills as Rhythm guitar player, 
- Jelle, with his fretless bass, capable of shaking up the earth, 
- Coen, hits his drums like a maniac, keeping everything together.

The band Militia Prima was found in May 2009, and an instant success. 6 weeks after their first meeting, the band had arranged a gig, through theatre venue "De Kom", at the Geinbeat Festival Nieuwegein 2009, where every band from Nieuwegein wants to play! 
After putting up a big gig on Geinbeat Festival 2009, Militia Prima went on with practicing and writing new material.

In January 2010, Militia Prima played at the Contest for Beginning Bands "De Kleine Prijs van Nieuwegein", accompanied by their two Roadies: Nick and Jasper. And of course, like everyone should do, they brought as many fans as they could. They filled almost the entire room and all went crazy in pits, a wall of death, and got lost in the menace of hair. 
And, as expected, they won the votes made by the public in as well the preliminary round as the finals, which meant they had won entrance to their biggest act to date: an individual spot at Geinbeat Festival Nieuwegein 2010!

On their ground-shaking performance at the Geinbeat Festival 2010, they announced their self-titled Demo (a.k.a. "System-Pack 1") had been released, featuring 3 of their best songs: "Fight Along Side", "Blast-Beat Fucking" and "Like A Dragon". Of course, the Demo was hugely appreciated among their many fans.

Militia Prima is now back in the studios, writing new material and preparing for more gigs and maybe even an album, although this has not been confirmed yet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Militia+Prima">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
