Often compared to Jonathan Richman and John Fahey, Kazutaka Nomura is one of the most hyped "Up&Coming" Seattle acts that explores musical possibilities only with a guitar and voice in his own humorous and quirky way. After winning Block Star Contest in Seattle in this year, he played a mainstage slot at Capitol Hill Block Party along with Spoon, Silversun Pickups, and John Vanderslice. His official debut full length will be out on Portland's SLENDER MEANS SOCIETY and NYC's AAGOO on March 3rd, 2008. His music will be featured the national Esurance commercial and CW11/CBS. He has appeared on Washington Post, Wire, Spin, Pitchfork, Timeout New York, etc. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pwrfl+Power">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
