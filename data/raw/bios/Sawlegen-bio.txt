Sawlegen was Originally Called "Virgin Beauty", created by Adil (Guitar), Mustapha (Vocals) and Mohcine (Guitar) in 2004. They released 2 songs that received very good feedback from some friends, especially for their unique extreme vocals and the melancholy that emerges from it... They decided to propel Virgin Beauty into a full band, and found a new line up with the same visions.
The chance to perform on stage came on January 2005, during an evening where they played some “goth” songs that were suitable for the new name  “Red Tears”.. 

After many rehearsals, concerts followed each other especially between 2005 and 2006, it was a great success for the band.

Some call it Symphonic Black metal, others talk about Experimental Metal while many say it's a sort of Black/Doom Metal... 
Sawlegen don't care about styles, don't care about nicknames or meaningless photos, its aim is to play its music and to play it in the most attractive way... So here you can find Symphonic Black Metal, Death Metal or Doom Metal like bands as Dimmu Borgir, Moonspell, Cradle of Filth..., but all is played in a unique and personal way... Extreme, Symphonic and Oriental, three words that fits Sawlegen music, and will stay engraved in (y)our heart... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sawlegen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
