Formed in the early days of 2006, Crackdust is a death metal band that hails from Gaborone, Botswana in Africa. Four months after its formation, the band was faced with some unexpected events that left it spread across a 500 km radius across the country at the beginning of the recording of their debut album.

This turn of events became a threat to the existence of the newly formed band. It was at this stage that the members, Roth (vocals, guitars), S’Bond (bass) and Dlax (drums) in a haze of deranged decision making released a single titled “deranged psychopath “.

As the band settles down to their current situation, very brutal shit can be expected in the not so distant future.

Fast forward ... December 2007...

The African death metallers have finally brought together their brutal carnage in the form of “dented reality”.


Mid 2008 saw the dust boys ramping up the madness a notch higher by inviting Lee to takeover the bass department, kicking S'Bond back to guitars where he has always belonged. The current line up is: Roth (vocals, guitars), Lee (bass), Dlax (drums) and S’Bond (guitars). The band performed opening act at the 2008 Woodstock Botswana at the beginning of September. Be in the lookout for more gigs before the turn of the year.
