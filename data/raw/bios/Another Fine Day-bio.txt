ANOTHER FINE DAY- what those luvvly critics have to say....

'LIFE BEFORE LAND' (album 1994/2004)

"...working in his Brixton back room with the minimal street-tech resources of a million other wired bedrooms, Tom Green sucks forms out of the air, giving audio shape to the feeling of sitting on a curve of sand, synchronising to tidal, primal sound loops..." DAVID TOOP, BEYOND press release 7/94

"...a fine example of the new eclecticism...this ambitious project succeeds through its ability to sound natural and supremely relaxed but challenging at the same time" ON MAGAZINE 9/94

"...talking of "ambient", there's some music in that genre that is so well made and easy on the ear that there's not much more to say. The excellent Life Before Land by Another Fine Day, is a case in point. " JOHN L WATERS, in THE GUARDIAN 10/7/05

"...this is music that I can't ever imagine not being part of my life."PETE LAWRENCE/THE BIG CHILL 8/04

'Life Before Land' was voted No 3 in THE INDEPENDENT'S "Best Ambient Albums" chart 7/05


'SALVAGE' (album 2000)

"Green creates a lovely and inviting sheen...even the traditional Shona piece "Cutting Branches" sounds like it took a left turn into a Parisian cafe in space."US BILLBOARD 26/8/00

"...before playing this lighter-than-air disc, you'd be well advised to nail your speakers to the floor." US JAZZ TIMES 2/01

"An essential release for any fan of downtempo, chill-out, or global contemplation" WAX 3/01

"...a gorgeously chilled collection of well-earthed tracks...It's like shopping organic in the supermarket, you get used to it 'cos you know it's good for you" DJ MAGAZINE 2/6/01

"...pure English summer, Big Chill, Enchanted Garden music...unique, interesting, and great for Sundays." MUZIK 7/01
