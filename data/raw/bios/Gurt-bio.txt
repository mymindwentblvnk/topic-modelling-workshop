GURT - Started with 4 lads wanting to make some bloody awful noise and that they did! Made up by Growth, Jbob, Simo and Iron Fist.. sharing a love of bands such as EyeHateGod, Weedeater, Down, Crowbar, Iron Monkey and all the is Sludgy!

GURT have been responsible for sore necks in and around London since 2010 and take no more pleasure than in hearing new fans claim that they ‘don’t usually like metal’ at the end of a gig. Some say their wide appeal is no surprise considering the diverse mix of influences and experiences they pull together from previous bands.

GURT take the blues and groove of 70s rock and drag it backwards through the swamps of Louisiana. The drums are thunderous, the vocals demonic and the guitars down-tuned, down-tempo and down-right sexy. This is not doom, this is not sludge, THIS IS GURT.
