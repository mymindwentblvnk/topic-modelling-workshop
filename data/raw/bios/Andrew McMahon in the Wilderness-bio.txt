Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness is the third musical project by Andrew McMahon, the former lead singer of Something Corporate and Jack's Mannequin.

McMahon announced the moniker in a blog post in July 2014, stating, "as I embark on yet another musical adventure, I will be traveling with my band to many of those same stages, this time as “Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness”.

The first song recorded under the moniker, 'Cecilia and the Satellite', received official radio play on the 17th July 2014.  An album is expected to follow. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+McMahon+in+the+Wilderness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
