Keramat is a brutal death/grind band from Malang, Indonesia formed in 1995 and has released their debut MC "Approximately Death" in 1997. Somewhere in late 2001, the band recorded this promo material including advance tracks for their upcoming album entitled "Vomiting Hatred" officially distributed in Europe by Torsten Oldenburg of Sick n Twisted Records (Germany). Expect pure guttural sickness from Keramat. This band mixed Death metal and Grindcore wisely, in the vein of American bands such as Disgorge, Devourment or Lividity. All songs are well executed incorporates technical guitar riffs along with just pure brutal instinct! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Keramat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
