Imaad Wasif (born in Vancouver) is a Canadian-born singer, guitarist and songwriter whose music combines elements of psychedelic folk and rock

Though born in Vancouver, Wasif was raised in Palm Desert in Southern California, and now resides in Los Angeles. He began playing music as a teenager and formed his first band, lowercase, was "a guitar-drums duo that played a weird hybrid of minimal lo-fi pop, post-rock and slo-core." They were signed to the seminal noise rock label Amphetamine Reptile. In 2001, he formed the psychedelic folk-rock group Alaska! and was briefly a member of The Folk Implosion as well as playing on Lou Barlow's albums for Merge Records. 

Wasif worked in collaboration with Karen O on the soundtrack to the film Where The Wild Things Are. As part of the Folk Implosion, he appeared in the 2002 movie Laurel Canyon.

His third album, The Voidist, was released in October 2009 on Tee Pee Records. 

In 2012 and 2013, Wasif completed two self-recorded works, "The Dark Water EP" and the album "Great Eastern Sun." Both albums were held back from release, Wasif citing them to be "too dark and too personal."

In 2014, he finished work on a fourth solo record, a concept album titled "Figurehead" again recorded with Mark Nevers. The album's release was stalled due to contractual issues.

In 2017, Wasif released "Dzi," on Grey Market. The album was recorded by Bobb Bruno on a Tascam Cassette 8-Track Machine, capturing a raw, live feel.

"Great Eastern Sun" was released on December 1, 2018 on Nomad Eel Records,  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Imaad+Wasif">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
