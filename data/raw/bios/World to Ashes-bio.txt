World to Ashes was founded in spring 2005 as a hardcore / metalcore band with Benjamin Possinger and Lorenz Schmidt on guitars, Gernot Wegele on drums and Achim Wiedemann on vocals. But shortly after it's conception, due to a musical style change (towards "Melodic Death Metal") Gernot left the band, so Achim stepped in as drummer and in the summer of 2005 Christoph joined on vocals. In this formation the band played several regional shows. In early summer of 2006 Christian stepped up to try the bass but it turned out that his ambitions didn't match with ours, so we parted as friends. The vacancy was filled by Sascha Hornberger in Spring 2007.
World to Ashes has played shows in Germany and Switzerland with bands such as Eluveitie, Sacrificium, Crisis Never Ends, Grotesque Impalement or Hands of Fate. 

The motivation behind World to Ashes is our passion for intense melodic music as well as the ability to present our thoughts, feelings and experiences in a form that meets their core. With our creation of art, we want to express the things we daily see and experience, the things that surround us, push us, alter us, bring us to the ground and in the end to the grave. Lyrically we mainly broach the issue of the struggles of society as well as suffering, death and dealing with all these things.
