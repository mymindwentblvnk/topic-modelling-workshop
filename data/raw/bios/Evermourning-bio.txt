Evermourning from Ft. Thomas, KY, USA was created in 2006 when they changed the band's name from Immolatus, due to a significant change in the line up and overall sound. The band is spearheaded by vocalist Steven Edwards and guitarist Patrick Hall (Sapthuran, Heathen Hammer). Recently Zane B. (drums) and Brandon A. (rhythm guitars) have parted ways with the project, temporarily putting any live performances on hold, and former drummer Ashmorn has agreed to once again work on further material.

Evermourning's lyrical themes and influences include that of The Natural World and its many mysteries, The Night, Melancholy, Dark Folklore, Philosophy, Mythology, etc. As well as artists such as Dissection, Emperor, Dawn, Burzum, Vinterland, Hecate Enthroned, Gates of Ishtar, In Flames, Dark Tranquility, Blind Guardian, Iron Maiden, etc.

As of early 2008 the band has released a self titled demo limited to 200 releases(2006), a limited promo entitled "Upon the Sky the Twilight Gathers"(planned release for 2007, but no word on whether or not it became available), and their first full length album entitled "Forever Entwined in Eternal Night" is slated for release sometime in 2008 on an unannounced/undecided label.
