"A massive rhythmic death metal penetration created in the depths of two minds insane, ready to rule the world of metal once and for all, shattering the foundation of earth. Time for retaliation is now! Enter the crypts of insanity!"

The band
Founded in early 2007 the musicians' creative insanity resulted in the full length debut Epitaph - 51 minutes of pain reflecting the depths of insanity in music and lyrics. Armed with this record and a lot of live-playing experience Thy Final Pain is confident to take the next steps of their crusade: Conquering the stages throughout Europe and worldwide.

The members
Thy Final Pain was founded by guitarist Simon Dorn and bass player Marc JÃ¼ttner, who met for the first time during a rehearsal session for a concert of the death metal band Debauchery where they played in 2006/07. Both shared the idea to create a musical project where they could let out their own visions of death metal. The result of this was the foundation of Thy Final Pain in January 2007, starting with "My Temptation" as their first release.
In June 2008 the live band was completed with Sascha Weber (guitars) and Lukas Nicol (drums).

The band's name
The intention of the newly founded band's name is as easy to understand as the name itself: The songs of Thy Final Pain are about the ultimate and final pain which is to be felt within the last moments of life, where one will be confronted with the weakness and the ambivalence of one's lifework. Feelings and impressions of the whole human lifetime are shown from different views and are described in words anybody might easily understand.
