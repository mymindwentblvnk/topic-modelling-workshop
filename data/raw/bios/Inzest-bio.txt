There are two known bands named Inzest:

1) Inzest was a frenzied, chaos-ridden proto-grindcore Japanese hardcore band from the late '80s, formed in Osaka. Their raw sound can be described as something between Negazione and Gauze. They are probably best known for releasing the flexi vinyl 'Another Religion Another Violence' in 1987.

2) Inzest is a death metal/metalcore band from Innsbruck, Austria, formed in 2003. Biography:

Inzest was founded in the year 2004 and plays extreme death metal with brutal Hardcore Influences (Dying Fetus meets Hatebreed). After a short time the first 7-track CD “The Natural Sound of Violence” was released and shattered the Underground like a bomb.

Consequently a deal with BURNSIDE RECORDS followed and in 2006 the first full-length album “The Sickest of Society” was released europewide.

One might think that a band can..t improve as quickly as Inzest, but in 2008 another incredible step was taken. In the beginning of 2008 the band recorded the new album “Grotesque New World” at Stage One Studios of ANDY CLASSEN. With this extraordinary product it was easy to find dedicated partners. Contracts with MAD LION RECORDS a famous extreme metal label, CATAPULT PROMOTION (booking) and TRITON STYLE (merchandise-endorsement) followed.

Furthermore the band performed in the course of several big festivals such as SUMMER NIGHTS, KALTENBACH and ZABBADUSCHDER. Between September and December 2008 the band is going to perform about 20 festival- and clubshows to promote the new record “GROTESQUE NEW WORLD”. Moreover some plans for 2009 are already set.

The release date of Grotesque New World is scheduled October 2008. The record is going to be distributed worldwide via MAD LION RECORDS/TWILIGHT DISTRIBUTION.

HARD FACTS

PRESS:

VAMPIERE MAG.
“If you like music that looks beyond its own genre, I can recommend Inzest”

LORDS OF METAL 79/100
“Inzest call themselves "the Austrian answer to the American art of brutality" similar to Hatebreed and Dying Fetus and devotees of that particular kind of style do not have to read any further and certainly have to go out and buy this fine piece of murderous deathmetalcore art. Others, do read on and be convinced that 'The Sickest Of Society' is an excellent addition to your CD-collection.”
