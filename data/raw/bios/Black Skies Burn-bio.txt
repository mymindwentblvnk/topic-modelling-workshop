Black Skies Burn are a ferocious four piece hailing from the Bowels of Oxfordshire. Blasting since 2005 and self-managed they provide a mass array of disgusting blast beats, gurningly vile riffs and gargling vocals ensuring a brutal show full of face fucking Death Grind. Influences including Dying Fetus, Napalm Death, Cannibal Corpse, Brutal Truth, Pig Destroyer and Stampin Ground. 

With a major line up change in 2012, releasing a Debut Album called "To Punish and Enslave" and being signed to Bored Stiff Records in 2013: The new vicious line up brings you a heavier and faster noise assault.
