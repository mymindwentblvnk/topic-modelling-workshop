The name "demoniah" has deep roots in the Arthurian legends, developed from the stories of Celtic mythology. Acording to those, Demoniah is the embodiment of evil. Charming and malicious, similar with Gullveig from Norse mithology, with a real form unknown to men, she can transform into many shapes. She serves the Dark Lord Bahaal or the Prince of Darkness, an evil creature, initially mortal and slain by King Arthur, he returned as a demonic nemesis determined to create chaos, havoc and war on earth.

The history of the Demoniah project begins early XXI century in the dark moldavian realm. Unearthing the runes of ancestors, Dark Lord Bahaal spiritualy revived after a few ears of mythology exploration, broke the chains of silence, evoking to humanity the ancient realms of chaos, havoc and war. Demoniah project is closely linked to Norse mythology - a universe full of myths, legends and beliefs about fantastic creatures. Sources of inspiration include: the Snorri Edda or New Edda, the Saemundr Edda or Old Edda, the runic inscriptions such as the Rok stone or Kvinneby amulet from Eggjumeste. The musical concept of Demoniah project is based on a combination of aggressive guitar riffs, powerful drums combined with mystical interludes of clean guitar and monumental keyboards. Voice combines elements of death metal, screamings of black metal and heroic anthems of clear voice. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demoniah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
