Dum Dum Girls were a garage pop band which formed in 2008 in Los Angeles, California, United States. The band last consisted of Dee-Dee (vocals, guitar), Jules (guitar, vocals), Malia (bass, vocals) and Sandy (drums, vocals).

Dee Dee formed Dum Dum Girls as a solo project—the name a nod to both The Vaselines’ album, Dum-Dum, and the Iggy Pop song Dum Dum Boys — and released a home-recorded CDR on her label Zoo Music followed by a 7" on HoZac and a 12" EP on Captured Tracks.

Dum Dum Girls released their full-length debut album "I Will Be" on March 30th, 2010 on Sub Pop. Produced by Dee Dee and Richard Gottehrer (Strangeloves, Voidoids, Blondie, The Go-Gos and, more recently, The Raveonettes), I Will Be is neither lo-fi nor too polished. Just under thirty minutes with eleven songs, it’s a short tribute to love, loss, fun, fear and the classic pop form of the ’60s girl groups and early punk rockers.

Dum Dum Girls released their second full-length album "Only In Dreams" on September 26, 2011. The Hold Your Hand Songfacts reports that it was recorded in Josh Homme’s Pink Duck studios and deals with the trauma of parental loss and emotional distance. 

Sub Pop released the band's EP "He Gets Me High" in early 2011.

Sub pop released the band's EP " End of Daze November 25, 2012. 

On January 28, 2016, Dee Dee announced the closure of the Dum Dum Girls and the creation of a new solo project, Kristin Kontrol.
