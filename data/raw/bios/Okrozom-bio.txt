Okrozom (www.okrozom.net) was formed in summer 2005 in Czech Republic and has been functioning in an unaltered format up to the present day:

Veronika Savincová (vocals),
Jan Tölg (guitar),
Josef Kalvas (guitar),
Zdenek Randa (bass guitar),
Peter Tyr (drums).

Although each member takes with them various music-genre experiences from past and present bands, Okrozom looks like homogenous unit. The production comes out from Veronika and Honza as a duo of authors, and the result is compositionally integrated mosaic. High-pitched guitar line, melodic riffs, lite dynamics and smooth girly voice develop a non-traditional form of rock music. The lyrics describe life and the world from it's dark side. In general they deal with inconclusiveness of life and irreconcilability with death and the world outside.
In spring 2006 the first demo "Sea of Sorrow" was released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Okrozom">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
