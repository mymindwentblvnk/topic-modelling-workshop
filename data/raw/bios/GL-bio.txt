There are multiple artists with this name:

1) Melbourne’s cosmic-funk revivalists and the soundtrack to eternal leisure. Cruising on glowing synths, gritty drum-machines, and stratospheric vocals, GL’s music is a cosmic dream-sequence not unlike a lost reel from the mid-80s. Signed on first listen by newly-minted Sydney label Plastic World (home to releases from Retiree, Alba, Tuff Sherm and Cassius Select), the duo’s debut EP Love Hexagon will introduce their pulsating sound with lead singles Won’t You See AND What Happened to Us plus remix treatment from Detroit’s house don Terrence Parker and Running Back head-honcho, Gerd Janson. It’s a salacious introduction to GL’s romantic hedonism, and just a taste of what’s expected in the future. 

2) A japanese touhou remixer.

3) Born Jarell Horn April 14th, 1986. growing up on the mean streets of Shreveport, La in a small ghetto called the Cooper Road (Skelly St. to be exact).

He started learning how to rhyme listening to Houdini, He knew the song "Friends" word for word by the time he was 6 years old. After years of writing and battling rappers from around the way He figured it was time to put his story on wax. He didn't record a song of His own until around 2003. After all the positive feedback and encouragement He grew more and more eager to get on tracks and let the truth be told. I guess you can say it created a monster... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/GL">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
