May 2005: startpoint for NOISELUST.

The continuous exchange of ideas between two of the most active members of the Greek underground music scene and for long time friends Tom/guitars (Violet Vortex, One Block Society) & Alex/drums (Violet Vortex, Defile des Ames, Asphodel, Skindread) led to the formation of an experimental band based on huge guitar sounds, slow tempos and emotional darkness as well as on psychedelic, space and acid rock musical trips.

The first attempts were more than successful, so a complete line up became a necessity. Two inspired and flame driven musicians came to fill-in the gaps: George/bass (Pera apo ton chrono) & Anna/vocals (Dear Serotonin).

The band went on to write and rehearse their material and soon became apparent that NOISELUST's unique sound and experimental vastness wouldn't take long to come alive.

So, now NOISELUST are ready to unleash upon unsuspected audiences their sorrowful, passionate and tripping mourn.
