Body of Scars

Given the trends that always fall by the wayside, Body of Scars has always had three philosophies: Keep it metal, keep it fresh, and long live old school.

From the streets of Phoenix in Arizona, this hard hitting unit is comprised of good friends, great musicianship, and a love for their craft. Formed in the early fall of 2006, Body of Scars has been busy writing, giggin’, and recording.

Musically speaking, it shreds simple, yet complex hooks that are wrapped in a blood stained box of metal.
Lyrically speaking, it yells sarcasm, screams aggression, croons juicy and is never influenced by people we know.

This 10 song CD is our first release as Body of Scars (2007)

James Santiago - Guitar and vocals
Randy Davis - Guitar and strings
Rikard Stirnquist  - Drums and percussion
Brian Shoemake - Bass

As this bio is being written, Body of Scars is finishing up writing a second release: Body of Scars Vol II, to begin recording early 2008.

Body of Scars is currently booked at premiere venues in the Phoenix AZ area, and are
seeking management, label or distribution.

Tearin’ shit up is our business, and we look forward to future possibilities with you.

Thank you for your time.
