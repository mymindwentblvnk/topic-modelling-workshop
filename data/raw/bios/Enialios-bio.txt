Enialios formed in 2007, however we stared playing more professionally at 2009.Till now we have not a stabilized line-up as we do not have a bass-guitar player moreover  we have some difficulties between us as the drum player is studying in another city.At January 2011 we released our first demo/promo. Even thought it was a home-recording production we are very satisfied for the whole work.We are planning to record an EP at the summer whereas the full length album will be released the following year.
