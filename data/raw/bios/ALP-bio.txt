There are multiple artists called Alp.

1. Alp is a solo project of Roger Horberry of O Yuki Conjugate. On the albums At Home With Alp (Soleilmoon, 1999) and Out And About With Alp (Soleilmoon, 2003), Horberry explores the tiny sounds of everyday life in Amsterdam, turning them into melodic smears of ambience. The debut album featured the sounds of Horberry's home while the sequel ventured out into Amsterdam itself.  

2. ALP is an English producer creating ambient soundscapes with hip-hop overtones. The music is happy, nice and relaxing. The debut ALP1 was released in August 2012, followed by ALP2 in November 2012, and ALP3 in July 2013.

3. Alp may also be an abbreviation for a metal band called A Liars Promise. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ALP">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
