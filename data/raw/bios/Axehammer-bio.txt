AxeHammer has been around since the early eighties, writing all original material. AxeHammer has always stayed true to great metal music, writing what comes from their hearts. When you hear the music of AxeHammer you will be amazed at how strong their music is and what a great message they bring to their fans. Their show is full of energy and entertainment that you donâ€™t want to miss. Jerry Watt and Joe Aghassi are the original members and have shared the stage with some of today's top metal bands, including: Slayer, Malice, and Agent Steel, just to name a few. Bill Ramp was the original singer that gave the band that distinctive sound. Unfortunately Bill stepped aside due to personal health complications. Mark Stewart was his temporary replacement until Kleber Freitas became our Lead vocalist. Bassist Eric "Oso" Hjort rounds out the band with his wicked low end and harmonies.
