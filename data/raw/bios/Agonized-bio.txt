Agonized was a Finnish death metal formed in Lahti, Finland in 1990. In 1991, they released their first and only demo "Gods..." and broke up soon afterwards.
Agonized were musically similar to other Finnish death metal contemporaries like Xysma, Abhorrence, Disgrace, Adramelech, Funebre and Demilich, but had their own sound. Their first and only demo was a perfect display of exceptionally raw, murky, heavy and sinister-sounding death metal.
