(2) INJA was originally born in the fall of 2003 in the northern part of Sweden. Formed by the two brothers Sami and Tomi, the whole idea was to start a band that would push themselves further then any of them had done with previous bands. The result was a massive collection of songs being written in very short time. Erica joined the band early 2004 after Tomi had met Ericas boyfriend who was a old childhood friend. Tomi told his friend about this new project INJA and that we were in desperate need of a singer. A few days later Erica recorded the song "As me", of course there was no question about it, she was the missing piece that would make this work.

Many tags and genres can be used to describe this young band from Lule√•, Sweden. Like many very talented, top female vocalists of today, Erica sings with a style that is uniquely her own and not easily copied. The entire band is a well meshed collection of disciplined artists.  They released a Demo Album of songs and it is available here on last.fm and their website.

They are friends and been touring with another Swedish band "Machinae Supremacy".  

INJA has signed a record deal with "TracksOnPeak" records. full length album out q1 2007.
