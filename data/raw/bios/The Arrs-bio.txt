The ARRS are a French Metalcore band. They formed in 1998.

Looking for powerful music that mixes the strength of Metal, the madness of Hardcore, sensible lyrics and constructive attitude?
Forget about clich√©s and followers, make way for France's The Arrs!

Since the 2003 "Condition Humaine" demo, the band have been working on their own accession, conscientious and clear-sighted.
Pitching on high risk, The Arrs recorded their hard liner debut "Et la douleur est la meme" (And the pain is the same) in 2005 and started touring at once with the leading French metal acts (Gojira, Dagoba, Eths,...)
After opening for various international Hardcore acts and performing at Hellfest, France, the creativity of the band reached new heights, embodied by sophomore album "Trinite" in 2007.

On new effort "Hero l Assassin" (Murderous hero), The Arrs decided to set their imagination free, creating an album without boundaries and standing at the crossroads of genres.
"Hero l Assassin" evokes the dark side of power, its morbid fascination and its lethal impact hiding behind pomp and glory. A pure reflection of the times, this violent, somber, intense and chaotic album expresses the reproaches made to contemporary gods.
