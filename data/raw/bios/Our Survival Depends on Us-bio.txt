Our Survival Depends on Us is a post-metal band from Salzburg, Austria.
The band was founded in 1999 by Mucho Kolb and Mani Eibner and released the first demo recording Breathe in 2000. After this release Thom Kinberger and Hajot Gmeilbauer (also: Thelema, Sturmpercht) joined OSDOU who had both already played with Kolb in Soulsearch. The band had multiple short time bassists until Barth Resch (formerly: Belphegor) took over permanently before recording their second album. In 2014 founding member Eibner left OSDOU and the band recruited Thomas Apfelthaler as the new drummer[1]. OSDOU are currently part of the VÃ¡n Records' roster <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Our+Survival+Depends+on+Us">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
