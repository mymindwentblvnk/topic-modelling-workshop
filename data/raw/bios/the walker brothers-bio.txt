The Walker Brothers was a 1960's pop group founded in California in 1964, that ultimately found fame and fortune in the UK rather than in their homeland. They had a number of top ten albums and singles in the UK during the period 1965â€“1968, including #1 chart hits with Make It Easy On Yourself and The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore), both of which also made the US top twenty.

The trio of Scott Walker (Noel Scott Engel), Gary Walker (Gary Leeds, formerly of The Standells), and John Walker (John Maus, November 12, 1943 - May 7, 2011) moved from the U.S. to Britain in 1965. Like The Ramones, they were not related, and adopted the same last name as a show business touch. They had only minor success in the U.S., but topped the UK singles charts with Make It Easy On Yourself in 1965 and The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore) in 1966.

After a UK tour in late 1967, which also featured Jimi Hendrix, Cat Stevens, and Engelbert Humperdinck, followed by a tour of Japan in 1968, the group officially disbanded. After the group disbanded, all three members scored U.S. and UK chart hits, under their Walker names.

Reforming in 1974, The Walker Brothers recorded a version of Tom Rush's No Regrets which soared into the British Top Ten after an absence of over a decade. However, the three albums that followed sold poorly:  No Regrets (1975), Lines (1976), and Nite Flights (1978). Scott Walker's tracks on the final album, Nite Flights, laid the stylistic groundwork for his later solo career.

John Walker died at his Los Angeles home on May 7, 2011 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Walker+Brothers">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
