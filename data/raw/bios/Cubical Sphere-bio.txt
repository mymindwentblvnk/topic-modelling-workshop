Cubical Sphere was formed back in 2002 in Thessaloniki, GR by Nikos Metaxas (guitar) and Simos Pagiavlas (bass). After several rehearsals as a duo they recorded the first demo of the band in 2004. After a few unsuccessful efforts the band finally found a drummer, Giannis Chionidis (also in Echidna, ex-Transcending Bizarre?), who, with the add of Dimitris Leontis (guitar) and Costas Margaritis (vocals) (also in Dustynation), gave the band a new dynamic, which led to the first live and later on to the second recording (Promo 2007). The band recorded "Promo 2007" without Simos on the bass; anyhow his contribution to the compositions of this promo is great and he'll always be considered a member of this band.

The band plays an amalgam of death and progressive metal containing rich essences of jazz-fusion. Their brilliant musicianship is just the vessel to deliver to anyone who's really willing to listen aggressive yet complex and full of mentality soundscapes.Listeners of Cynic,Gordian Knot,Aghora,Death and Pestilence should not overpass them..      <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/CUBICAL+SPHERE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
