Heathen Dawn was a Melodic Black Metal band from France - formed in 1998 and split-up after their 2002 EP release "Wasted Land". Wasted Land is basically a very Atmospheric foggy album with Melodic guitar tones and characteristics but, represented in a very Folk-like manner. Before Wasted land they released a demo in 1999 called "Olwen". The lyrics generally portray a theme on Heathenism and Mythology - often common in Folk Black Metal. During the process of their releases they were signed to a label called Aura Mystique Productions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heathen+Dawn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
