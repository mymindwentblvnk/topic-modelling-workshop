Currently, We Are:

-Working on new shit

RELEASES:
-25 Track Debut Release: "HARVESTING OVUM" - Avaliable now for download

-Split - We're currently discussing the idea and concept of doing a 4-way split, but ONLY AFTER "HARVESTING OVUM" is released.

-Splits/Comps - Contact Us If You Are Seriously Interested. We are more than willing to do splits and compilation albums, but would prefer to refrain from doing releases for download, hard copies are where it's at!

P.S. Other than minimal use of a pitch shifter, No vocal effects are used in our recordings.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/OvaryRot">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
