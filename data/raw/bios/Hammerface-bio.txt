Hammerface was born in March 2004.
Created as a side project of Martin Ayala (Thornlord)
and Chris Coccia (Taishakuten/Stem Cell Virus)
The intent is simply to just jam some slow and heavy sludge..
Like a drunken Godzilla stumbling over your town..
The core of the band a duo.. Either bass/drums or guitar/drums..
Live shows sometimes become a three piece power trio,
with a revolving cast of non-drummer drummers.
Hammerface is 99% improvisation.. You never know whats going to happen..
Most of the time, neither do we..
All we know is.. We get really drunk..
Turn up as loud as we can..
And rock. Or whatever you people call it.. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hammerface">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
