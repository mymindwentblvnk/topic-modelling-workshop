Black Eagle Child is the musical outlet of Milwaukee, WI resident Michael Jantz. His music ranges from brief folk melodies incorporating simple folk orchestration to longer, meandering pieces built on looped guitars and raw sound synthesis with midi and computer.  All his music is recorded, mixed, and mastered at his home in Milwaukee.
