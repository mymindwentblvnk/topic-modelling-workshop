Archaeon is a technical/brutal death metal outfit based north of Boston, Massachusetts.  With Brian Martins and Grant Evans on guitars, Michael Lefman on bass, Jackson Korba on drums, and Carlos Moran on vocal duty, Archaeon brings a unique style of technical and brutal death metal that retains a sense of brutality and melody.


Archaeon plans on releasing an EP entitled "Vanitas" in mid to late 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Archaeon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
