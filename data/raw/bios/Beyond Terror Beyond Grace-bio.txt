Based in Sydney, Australia, Beyond Terror Beyond Grace combine death metal, black metal, post-rock, ambient and progressive elements to create a unique form of aural extremity. After playing more than 55 shows over 15 countries in the last year across Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States with some of the biggest names in extreme metal, the band is now is set to release its brand new album â€“ Nadir.

Recorded and mixed by Joel Taylor at Three Phase Studios in Melbourne, Australia over only two weeks in May 2011, mastered by Alan Douches at West West Side Music and featuring 7 tracks with guest appearances by Jason Netherton of Misery Index and Rob Allen of The Abandonment and Encircling Sea along with artwork by Colin Marks of Rainsong Design, Nadir captures the band completely in its natural element, defying genre categorisation and ignoring all current musical trends.

The end result is the bands most ambitious, atmospheric and realised effort yet. Cold, climactic and expansive, Nadir is a consuming experience of monolithic bleakness and dense majesty.

On November 17th 2012 vocalist Blake announced that their show in Sydney would be the bands last ever performance
