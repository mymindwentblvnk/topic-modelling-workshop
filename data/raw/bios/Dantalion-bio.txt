Dantalion was formed in Vigo, Spain, in mid 2004 by Naemoth, Neztja and Zeukram after the split-up of their previous band, completing the line-up with Maiestas.

They began to write their first songs and playing their first live shows, with a good response from the audience. In mid 2005 Dantalion hits Oceano Studios to make their first recording, “When the Ravens Fly Over Me”, with 7 songs and a total time over 46 min. They extract three songs from this recording to conform a promo in order to present it to labels and media worldwide, receiving a deal to release their first album and getting good reviews.

After the recording of the album, bass player Maiestas decides to leave the band, entering Thorgrim as a permanent replacement, completing the current line-up, Zeukram-vocals, Netzja-guitars, Naemoth-drums and Thorgrim-bass.

Their first album was released by the German label Det Germanske Folket, and the band has prepared a new American edition through Concreto Records.

Currently the band is doing some concerts to present their first album and writing new songs for the second recording.
