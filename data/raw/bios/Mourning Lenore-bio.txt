Formed in early 2008, Mourning Lenore are a doom metal band hailing from the ancient city of Lisbon, Portugal. João Arruda put out the band together, yet without a name, by searching for visionary doom lovers among the web, soon finding three of them to start the quest. João Galrito, Claúdia Andrade and Emanuel Henriques joined Mourning Lenore and started building piece by piece, brick by brick the personality and orientation of the band. Later that year, and after searching through several bass players, Joana Martins became Mourning Lenore's bassist to help spreading the melancholy and decandence so intimately connected with the band. Needing some more heaviness, in October 2008 Mourning Lenore parts ways with their female singer, Claúdia Andrade, and guitarist João Galrito assumed the role of band's frontman to share his pain with the world. 

In 2009, they entered studio with Fernando Matias (Moonspell, f.e.v.e.r., Insaniae, etc) in Urban Insect Studios in order to records two songs for a split with Insaniae to celebrate Daemonium Blog's 3rd anniversary. 

At the end of 2010, they released their debut album, Loosely Bounded Infinities, but shortly after its release, in early 2011, the band parted with vocalist/guitarist João Galrito. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mourning+Lenore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
