Brutal Death Metal band from San Juan, Puerto Rico. 

Intestinal Fermentation was formed in 2005 with only Victor Gaby and Norberto. Everything started as an attempt to ressurect songs from a previous band which Norberto and Gaby (who are brothers) had.
They were making songs until one day they decided to change the name because the material was different to the previous band.

They were around 8 months looking for a bassist until they found Jorge in summer 2005 and since then Intestinal Fermentation has been contributing to the putrification of the planet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Intestinal+Fermentation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
