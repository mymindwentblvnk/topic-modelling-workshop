Based out of Northern Connecticut, Katahdin is a four piece Black Metal band with many influences. Rather than focusing on exhausted metal themes such as Norse Mythology or Satanism, Katahdin is taking an approach closer to home. New England's dark past has been set aside and forgotten about for hundreds of years. We intend to invoke the unrelenting gloom that once eclipsed this land through armor piercing blasts, consistently ruthless thrashing, and utterly depressing tales of its past.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Katahdin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
