MADANII is the Berlin based Iranian-German singer Dena Zarrin. Under her mother’s maiden name she combines elements of Pop, R’n‘B, Trap and Electronic Music, topped off with sounds of the Persian music world. The dark and organic songs often deal with political and socio-critical topics that arise from her provenance and surrounding world DO I LOOK DANGREROUS 2 U? is the title of her forthcoming debut EP. MADANII plays with concepts of what the Western world deems ‘conventional’ or ‘foreign’ and serves an artistic synthesis in which you can lose yourself in on various levels.

With their song "ROSEMVRY", MADANII put out a catchy Pop tune addressing communication problems in a relationship as their third single. Carefully woven into the bubbly chorus you can find the sound of a kamanche. An old Iranian string instrument, yet again proving how one can beautifully put together elements of different worlds that do not seem to be a great fit at first sight. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MADANII">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
