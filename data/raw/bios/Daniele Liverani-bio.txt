Finally his first solor record 'VIEWPOINT' is released in 1999.
Liverani's next move would be the monumentous trilogy releases GENIUS TRILOGY endeavour released in 3 chapters in 2002, 2004 and 2007.
A massive wealth of global Rock talent was on hand to perform the parts of individual characters to tell the tale of the 'Genius' character's journey.

Another album with his band EMPTY TREMOR is released:THE ALIEN INSIDE features the new singer OLIVER HARTMANN.
The album is released by Frontiers records worldwide and leads the band to the great experience sharing stage as opening band for the “Train of toughts” italian summer tour of DREAM THEATER in 2004.
Embroiled in yet another ambitious venture the Italian struck up a partnership with STEVE WALSH of KANSAS repute, combining efforts to forge KHYMERA.
KHYMERA is an AOR pot pourri project. The debut album would score heavily on the points scale for having lead vocals sessioned by STEVE WALSH of KANSAS and STREETS fame.
The songs collected for the 2003 debut album would prove of great curiosity value including two tracks previously recorded by MR. BIG for the 'Navy Seals' soundtrack, the Giorgio Moroder penned 'Strike Like Lightning' and 'Shadows' alongside no less than four tunes penned by SURVIVOR guitarist JIM PETERIK with 'Living With A Memory', 'Say It With Love', 'Tears On The Page' and 'Aftertouch'.
Also featured were two WINGER compositions 'Without Warning' and 'Written In The Wind' and a HARDLINE track 'Love Leads The Way', originally included as a Japanese bonus cut for the 'Double Eclipse' album. The MECCA duo of Joe Vana & Thom Griffin would supply backing session vocals.
That same year a second solo album 'Daily Trauma' saw issue. Liverani handled all instrumentation excepting drums, delegated to Dario Ciccioni.
KHYMERA releases another album and gathered a full band lineup with Dennis Ward of PINK CREAM 69 on vocals, drummer DARIO CICCIONI and new guitar sensation TOMMY ERMOLLI.
Ward makes his absolute debut as lead singer with this album showcasing an incredible voice that will make one wonder how come this guy never take the mike in hand before playing bass!
The songs are again gathered from some of the most outstanding writers in the melodic rock and AOR scene featuring the likes of Robin and Judithe Randall (If You Dare To Dream), Jeff Scott Soto (You Can't Take Me), Don Barnes (Looking For You and After The Way), but the bulk of the album showcases the shining songwriting of brothers Tom and James Martin (ex SUGARTOWN), who penned songs for such artists as DO (Angel By My Side) and RONAN KEATING among others.
Just like the first record was the very best melodic rock could offer, the new one showcases a rich and diverse songwriting along with great musicianship.
