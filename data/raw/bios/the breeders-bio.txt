The Breeders is an alternative rock band based in Dayton, Ohio, USA. The band was first formed by Kim Deal and Tanya Donelly in 1989. Originally intended as a side-project for Deal and Donelly while still in their full-time bands Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively, The Breeders quickly became Deal's primary recording outlet. The original line-up also included bassist Josephine Wiggs of The Perfect Disaster, and drummer Britt Walford of Slint. The band has had several lineup changes over the years, with frontwoman Kim Deal being the band's sole continuous member; Deal's twin sister Kelley Deal joined in 1992, and has remained in the band ever since. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Breeders">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
