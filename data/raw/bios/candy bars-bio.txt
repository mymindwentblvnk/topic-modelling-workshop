Hailing from Tampa, FL, Candy Bars were formed in 2003 by Daniel Martinez (from the guitar department) and Ryan Hastings (the percussion department) as the antithesis to the metal-minded customer

With no bass player and a name intended to counteract the gloomy nature of their songs, the duo began splitting their time between open mic nights and local nighttime hot-spots. Aided by 3 self-recorded and self-released DIY demos, Candy Bars quickly became Tampa's best kept secret.

Wanting to explore a more dynamic musical territory, the band officially became a trio in early 2005 with the addition of cellist Melissa Castellano, who subsequently brought the much-desired symphonic layers to their Incidental Heroin Pop, or psychedelic pop, or chamber pop, or indie rock, or whatever you want to call it.

During the summer of 2005, the band re-visited and re-recorded the best songs from their previous demos, resulting in their debut full length, "On Cutting Ti-Gers in Half and Understanding Narravation"
