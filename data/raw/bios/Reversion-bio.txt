Reversion is a progressive/melodic metal band founded in 2004. Reversion recorded their first demo in 2006. They achieved lot of attention from several record companies so in the January of 2007 it was time to record the Hurt-ep.

Playing gigs and promoting the ep intensively resulted in signing a record deal with Kampas Records in 2007. The following year Reversion recorded their first full length album King Of Deceit which was published in July 9th, 2008. 

Reversion has played plenty of gigs promoting the album. They have received very good feedback about their music and performance from both the audience and the critics. 

At the moment Reversion is working on a new album and playing gigs around the Southern Finland.
