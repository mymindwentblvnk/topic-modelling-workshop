SPIRIT WEB is a US-Power Metal band which has veteran musicians from some well known local CHICAGO METAL bands which include SYRIS, SLAUTER XTROYES, DARK AGES, STONEHENGE, WINTERKILL, STYGIAN, THE ENERGY VAMPIRES, HABITUAL RITUAL, THE LORDS OF MEAT, AND MICHAEL ANGELO'S NITRO

SPIRIT WEB was formed in August of 1998 after PAUL SPEREDES left the band SYRIS. The musical vision of PAUL SPEREDES was to find the absolute best metal musicians in the Chicago area and form a band and record an album. The previous SYRIS album: UNSEEN FORCES which was mostly written by brothers-in-arms SPEREDES (guitars) and SCOTT HUFFMAN (vocals) made PAUL him realize the great song writing-chemistry that SCOTT and him had together. The only thing lacking was a strong rhythm section. The plan was to record an original power metal album, which would truly highlight the musical ability of each member of SPIRIT WEB, which was the name they had come up with for the new band. They wanted musicians who had no limitations! We needed a truly powerful rhythm section! After dozens of auditions a killer-drummer was finally found. TONY RIOS, formerly a member of WINTERKILL joined SPIRIT WEB. He had the speed, intensity, and creativity that the band required. Out of more than a dozen auditions for the position, TONY was the only one who instinctively knew what beats to play to our music. Shortly thereafter the near-legendary Chicago Bass player BRENT SULLIVAN (voted best bass player in Chicago by the Chicago Reader) from SLAUTER XTROYES and WINTERKILL fame joined also. The music now combined unbelievably powerful machine-gun-style double bass drums underneath extremely heavy, but tuneful guitar and bass riffing, with stunning, powerful, melodious vocals. Everything from the most striking melodies to the most angry, aggressive, rhythm guitar and shredding leads. Since the SPIRIT WEB debut album was auto-financed, the band was able to play music that they truly enjoyed without having to worry about any commercial pressures. The result was an honest and authentic power metal record.

After the release of the self-titled SPIRIT WEB album, the band received extremely positive reactions and reviews from the European Metal Magazines! Germany's HEAVY ODER WAS!? Magazine gave the SPIRIT WEB CD a rating of 10 points, and they were rated 9 out of 10 and voted best underground CD of the month in Germany's ROCK HARD Magazine. In addition to this SPIRIT WEB were given the very prestigious honor of having the track: GHOSTLY CHILL included on the January 2001 ROCK HARD Magazine sampler. This compilation was distributed to approximately 80,000+ fans in Germany. The song OSIRIS BE THY JUDGE was included on the METAL INVADER Magazine's WARZONE, another sampler disc that was distributed primarily in Greece. After initially selling copies of the album on the bandï¿½s own STENTORIAN RECORDS label SPIRIT WEB reached an agreement to license the album to MAUSOLEUM RECORDS, after the album had been recommended to MAUSOLEUM by a PATRICK DE SLOOVER of OVERDRIVE, a pioneering local Belgian heavy metal radio show.

Unfortunately in 2001 SPIRIT WEB also had to replace drummer TONY RIOS, for personal reasons. SPIRIT WEB wishes TONY the best of luck with his personal life. Fortunately with their rock solid reputation in the Chicago area they had many of the best drummers in the area interested in replacing RIOS.

In the end CHUCK WHITE got the job. CHUCK, who toured with the well-known guitar hero MICHAEL ANGELO and his band NIITRO. Guitarist SPEREDES and bass player SULLIVAN connect extremely well with WHITE because he is used to playing drums to intense neo classical guitar and bass riffing! The band will never compromise on using less than perfect musicians in the lineup! SPIRIT WEB will only write music and perform live with serious, passionate, and outstanding veteran players. This is their commitment to all their loyal worldwide fans.

SPIRIT WEB recorded 2 new killer bonus tracks entitled: DREAM NEVER ENDING and BLIND FAITH, to be included on the MAUSOLEUM release of the SPIRIT WEB album. The release will also feature new artwork, and a more comprehensive booklet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spirit+Web">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
