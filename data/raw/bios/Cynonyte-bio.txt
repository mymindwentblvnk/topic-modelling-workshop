Cynonyte is a Winston-Salem, NC based Thrash/death metal band that was formed back in 2004. Since then, there has been a few changes to the line-up and an even greater change to the song writing. And luckily, its paid off; they have since opened for international acts like Scar Symmetry, Epica, Hypocrisy, Ensiferum, Blackguard, Silent Civilian, and The Agonist...... to name a few.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/CYNONYTE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
