Enrapture was a band that many people no doubt discovered during pre-2002 MP3.com, when they had a website that hosted many of their music free of charge and offered their CDs at a very good price. The band was listed under Industrial Electronica. The song 'The Underworld is My Bitch' was used in anime trailer advertisements on DVDs.

Currently the band is selling their music on the following site. http://www.isound.com/enrapture_ca/

Also they have a myspace site - www.myspace.com/enrapturemusic
