Total hate performs raw, hateful and satanic black metal in the traditional way of the early 90´s in Germany (Nuremberg, Bavaria) , WITHOUT ANY POLITICAL INFLUENCES!!! The band was formed in 2002 by Adrastos as a sideproject to his main band seeds of hate. In 2002 the first Total Tate demo (LTD 300) has been released through Flaming Hate Productions/Germany and in 2004, the demo has been rereleased on CD (LTD 999) including 3 exclusive bonus tracks by Hell Attacks Productions/Colombia. After the release, Vlad joined Total Hate as new second guitarist and they wrote new songs for a mini CD and a split EP with Stillhet from Norway. In 2005, Tondhron has been replaced through Excoriator on drums and a bass player was found in Aer. With this line-up, they played their first live show at the Under The Black Sun Festival. In 2005/ 2006, Agonia Records from Poland released the mini CD “Pure Hatred and Blasphemy”. Total Hate signed also a contract with Agonia Records for 2 full length CD's/LP's. In February/March 2006, the band played a mini tour "Days of Hate and Destruction" with Blodsrit, Elite and Insignium. Tourstations were in Poland, Germany and the Netherlands. Finally, in 2006, the long awaited split EP with Yersinia was released through Deviant Records/Germany. The Stillhet split EP is still unreleased, but should be available soon. The first Total Hate album "Depopulating Planet Earth" is out now and also "Necare Humanum Est"!
