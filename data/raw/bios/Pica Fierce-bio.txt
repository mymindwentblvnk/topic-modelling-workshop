Pica Fierce is a Thrash/Death metal band from Kristiansund, Møre og Romsdal, Norway which was formed in 1999. Their music style is mainly melodic death/thrash metal with a technical edge to it, and they have been said to be some sort of a hybrid between the band Death and swedish melodic death metal
The band decided to split up in 2009, with the members citing a lack of creative stimulation through being in the band being the reason.
