There are two bands with the name Compost:

1. Compost was a jazz/funk/fusion outfit from 1971 to 1973.  Something of a supergroup, the band consisted of Bob Moses (organ, clavinet, drums), Jack DeJohnette (drums, piano), Jumma Santos (percussion),  Jack Gregg (bass), and Harold Vick (saxophone, flute).  Only two records were generated from these musicians: 1971's "Take Off Your Body," and the album "Life is Round," released in 1973, which featured additional performances from Roland Prince (guitar), Ed Finney (guitar), and Jeanne Lee and Lou Courntey (vocalists).

The Compost ensemble was formed, to quote drummer Jack DeJohnette, as "a co-operative band comprised of a group of people who are all versatile and whose egos are directed into positive channels, thereby overcoming the old leadership-versus-sidemen problem." 

2. Compost is also an Italian goregrind band that started in 2007, releases include the "Frigoverre" demo from '08 and 2009's split 7"s with Insomnia Isterica, Ultimo Mondo Cannibale and Necrocannibalistic Vomitorium. The band is notable for having their lyrics being almost purely about vegetables. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Compost">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
