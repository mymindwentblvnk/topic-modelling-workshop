When most boys are sixteen-years-old, they’re busy rinsing the latest edition of FIFA and wondering how to get laid.

Now aged nineteen, the wunderkind has his eyes set on asserting himself as one of the finest producers around.

We know he’s got the production skills to do it, and he’s now also got a collaboration with one of the scene’s heavy-hitters under his belt.
