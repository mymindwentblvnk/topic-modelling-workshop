But from 1988 until 1994, there were several lineup changes that culminated in Tracey leaving the band, putting an end to Overdrive for what seemed for good. But the band reformed in 2004 when they realized that their old EP from years past was getting recognition.

Overdrive released their second album "Everything’s fine" in 2000, also for Boa Records, but with slight delay.
