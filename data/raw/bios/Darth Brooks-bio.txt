Inspired by Jon Wayne and Bob Log III, Ronnie James and Peggy Sue created Darth Brooks, an attempt to cross the attitude of real country (Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers) with the guitar sleaze of AC/DC. Darth joined in 1999 and as a trio they remained active for a number of years, playing mostly on Vancouver Island. The project eventually succumbed to an overdose of painkillers and bourbon, but not before an album was recorded: General Disregard. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Darth+Brooks">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
