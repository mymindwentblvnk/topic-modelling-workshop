ill-gotten emerged from the bowels of the Minnesota Twin Cities in 2007 to unleash an assault of heavy metal along with an arsenal of rhythmic chaos and devastating vocals. Formed in the wake of other projects, Joe/"J" (vocals), Brandon "Thuegod" Thue (guitar), Craig Lee (bass) and Blake Jette (drums) spent 2006 in a very small room planning their next move. With their freakish use of "musical instruments" and calm collectiveness followed by intense eruptions of energy, ill-gotten manage to shake the $%!# right out of your @$$. Thats why youll love it and thats why youll need diapers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ill-Gotten">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
