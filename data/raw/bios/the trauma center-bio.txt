The Trauma Center (Trauma Center)... is a truly unique, pure, Philly Hip Hop group with a progressive sound from the streets of Philly. 

The Trauma Center has been around since the early ninety's when founder, Shephatiah, AKA DJ Rocksteady, worked to deliver blood through Pa & NJ part time for the Red Cross.

Shephatiah formulated The Trauma Center into a full fledged independent label after a near fatal accident landed him in the Trauma Center. 

Shephatiah built the Trauma Center Studio to record with members of his earlier hip hop group, the Bad News Crew, and new members who were later signed to the group that now forms The Trauma Center. 

Today The Trauma center is a internationally known independent label, as the group has developed an impressive following overseas in countries like Switzerland, France, Germany, and The Netherlands with their older release from 1994 Rhymes Overflowin, to their 2001 release, Hardcore Underground Gritty. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/the+trauma+center">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
