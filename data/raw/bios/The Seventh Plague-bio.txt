Since October of 2006 The Seventh Plague has been demanding respect...and getting it, from their own Las Vegas music scene, and the entire nation. After putting out a few previous demo's and EP's, The Seventh Plague's most recent CD was recorded in September of 2009 with Andrew Glover, bass player of infamous deathcore band Winds of Plague, at Sound Temple Studios. It is called "Trust Me, I'm A Liar", and is set for official release in early 2010. You can hear the tracks on the band's myspace/purevolume/last.fm etc. As for what's coming next for the band, it's hard to say. But what you can count on is more touring, more recording, and the same balls-out heavy music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Seventh+Plague">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
