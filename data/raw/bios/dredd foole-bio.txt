Dredd Foole is the name used to designate the music of Boston-area vocal/guitar artist Dan Ireton. He (aka Dan Ireton) is the Boston equivalent of Los Angeles' Wild Man Fischer. His spaced-out vocals engage sloppy rhythms in Cramps-ian garage-rock numbers. He used to lead a band under the name Dredd Foole & the Din, recording two mostly neglected albums in the 80s for labels known as Homestead and PVC. It was commonly known that his band was one of the only Boston bands worth seeing post-Mission of Burma (who backed him up actually, as the original Din, on his debut single in 1982). Those records were fine for the time, but they hardly captured the full intensity-scope of the 1st-gen post-VU/Stooges blare of that band in their prime. In the late 80s Dan wisely abandoned the rock band format and has sporadically been performing a series of breathtaking shows in the otherwise ready-to-be-nuked-today local "club scene" ever since. Sometimes solo acoustic, sometimes with percussion, electric slide guitar or violin accompaniment, he sings with one of the most electrifying post-Tim Buckley vocal chords ever heard, and his concept of multiphonic non-traditional folk music with apocalyptic come-down power-appeal has finally been documented with this long overdue release.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dredd+Foole">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
