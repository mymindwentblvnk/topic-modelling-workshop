Sicks Daze were created as an idea back in early 1999 by Matt(voice) and Elias(bass). Their intentions were to express their musical concerns which include countless things, but mostly the rock n'roll philosophy, not just as a sound, but also as an aspect and way of life. After some failed attempts to form a working band, finally, in September 1999, Kostas(guitar) and Foivos(drums) entered the band. With this line-up, Sicks Daze released two demos, "Enter the Daze" and "My Best Day of Your Life", which both, generally speaking, were in the stoner/doom/heavy rock area. At the end of 2000, Kostas decided to leave the band due to disagreements on the musical direction of the band and soon after that he was replaced by Thanasis. With this line-up, at the end of 2001, Sicks Daze recorded their third demo, titled "Six Days", which is undoubtedly the most representative sample of their work so far, in the vein of heavy stoner/rock n'roll, and influenced by bands like Entombed, Motorhead, Hellacopters, Corrosion of Conformity, etc., but always with the distinct Sicks Daze sound. The band has been on hold since 2005. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sicks+Daze">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
