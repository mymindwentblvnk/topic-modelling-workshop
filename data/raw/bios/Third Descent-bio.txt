Third Descent was formed in fall at 2003 as a reunion of former Moonlight Descends members.
For that time the music had become more technical and agressive and new lyrics were more military and unromantical than MD times. As a final turn we decided to change the band name as well and start all over again.
The basis of a new band were Eku – vocals, Raivo – guitar, Tan – guitar and Saku – synth. Then joined Kris – drums and Arvo – bass but after some time Arvo left the band.In the beginning of 2005 we started with new members Priit – bass and Nuki – drums. In assistance of Vaiko Hansson statred to record new songs as well. As a lack of resources we decided to program the drums and that was Kris`s assignement. 
In 2006 we finally finished 2-songs promo and 5-songs demo which is about to see the daylight.
