'Give me a lever long enough and a place to pivot it on, and I shall move the earth'.

Archimedes, the ancient greek mathematician and philosopher, made this claim to King Hiero of Syracuse on the subject of levers and angular displacement. This bold statement holds the passion and vision on which we based our name of I Shall Move The Earth.
Not only does it proclaim a sense of trust in the forces that rule and guide the cosmos, but it also states a promise of things to come. For Archimedes was only one of the first great thinkers. Like Newton, Copernicus, Tesla, Galileo but also Agrippa, Levi and John Dee after him, ISMTE is looking for ways to expand on the ideas of science, magic and mystery. To continue in the footsteps of brave men and women who dedicated their lives to pushing the envelope of science and continued to discover more and more of the secrets of the world and what lies beyond.

Based in the Netherlands, ISMTE is ambitiously creating its own blend of Stargazing Black Metal. Shaping it in a style, drawing inspiration from both the established (black) metal sound from the mid-90â€™s as well as from more experimental/avant-garde genres of music.

ISMTE is on the verge of unleashing a promotional set of songs upon the world. And writing continues for a full lenght album which will promise a journey worthy of that bold statement made by Archimedes.
