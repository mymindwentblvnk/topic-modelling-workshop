Begun as Aura in 1993, the group became Lemur Voice quite quickly. The Dutch outfit was composed of Marcel Coenen (guitar), Barend Tromp (bass and stick), Gregoor van der Loo (vocals), Franck Faber (keys), and Nathan van de Wouw (drums). Their first album, Insights, was released in 1996. The follow-up, Divided, came out in 1999, and the title would prove to be prophetic as the band decided to call it quits while working on the writing for what would have been their third album.
