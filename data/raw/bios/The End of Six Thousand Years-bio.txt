"In march 2004 Tadzio, Teo (Corey) and Lou (xREPRISALx -r.i.p.-) started getting together to float a new musical project.

Few months later, Nicola (xKILLFORLOVEx -r.i.p.-, and former member in MEMORIES OF APOCALYPSE) joined the band as singer and Sandro (xAS HUMANITY FADESx -r.i.p.-), joined the band as second guitar player. From the 20/04/05 to the 22/04/05 TEOSTY entered in studio to record a promo CD, to spread their music worldwide.

Now TEOSTY are signed with the Italian label STILL LIFE RECORDS.
They will release a split CD with EMBRACE THE END (abacus/century media) that will be out in February on STILL LIFE RECORDS. A full length CD is scheduled for the end of 2006."
