Miyachi is a New York-based Japanese American rapper (born in 1993). 

Miyachi has released his long-awaited debut album, Wakarimasen. The rapper has had an interesting career over the past several years, taking aim at Asian-American stereotypes to flowing effortlessly over boom-bap and trap-laden instrumentals.

With the debut album, Miyachi aptly blends hip-hop sensibilities with East and West, finding collaborations alongside Korean R&B swooner Jay Park, soulful hip-hopper Yameen, and more. The album successfully takes a contemporary approach to much of the sound resonating within the music-based subculture as of late — club hitters like “Legalize” are contrasted by boom-bap focused tracks like “Prince of Tokyo,” offering up a successful showcase of Miyachi’s ability to bilingually flow over a range of styles. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Miyachi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
