2. Omnia is an electronic dance music producer, his track Stick in monday was featured in the Trance Mix Mission Podcast.

Man behind it all, is Evgeny Smirnov. Born in 1987, he would grow up with a diverse taste in music, loving and exploring the beauty of different genres. In the 90’s, he turned his passion for EDM into a hobby and started toying around with producing programs. After discovering trance music, Evgeny knew which path to follow and started developing his sound into this direction.

At the end of 2006, when Evgeny was only 20 years old, he concentrated on creating his own, quality tracks and saw big names like Armin van Buuren, Markus Schulz and Above & Beyond play his tracks and remixes on the radio and during gigs. Remixes on ‘Ørjan Nilsen – La Guitarra’ and ‘Armin van Buuren feat. Jacqueline Govaert – Never Say Never’ put Omnia’s name on the map.
