Skeletons & The Girl-Faced Boys (originally just Skeletons) is a project of New York-based musician and artist Matt Mehlan and various friends. Mehlan is a co-founder of the Shinkoyo collective, which creates music and art based on a DIY ethic of collective improvisation and eccentricity. Having created the albums Life and the Afterbirth and Iâ€™m At the Top of the World for Shinkoyo, Mehlan was signed to Ann Arbor-based Ghostly International in 2004.

Following the name change from Skeletons to Skeletons & The Girl-Faced Boys, Mehlan released the Git full-length on Ghostly in June 2005. The album garnered comparisons ranging from Can to Animal Collective to Boyz II Men and Mariah Carey. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skeletons+And+The+Girl-Faced+Boys">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
