Israfel is a brutal death metal band that was formed in 2005, in Albany, New York. Their debut was released in 2009 by Nice to Eat You Records, titled Chainsaw Gynecology. Their name comes from an archangel in Islam. In Arabic the name means "The Burning One". 
Israfel holds his holy trumpet to his lips century after century, awaiting the signal from God to sound it at the Last Judgement. At this time he will descend to Earth and stand upon the holy rock in Jerusalem. The first blow of his trumpet will shatter the world, and the second blow will awaken the dead and summon them to judgement  
obviously not a brutal deathcore band, not one metal band i heard sounds like this, more arabian nights, meets nights into dreams. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Israfel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
