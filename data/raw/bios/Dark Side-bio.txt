There is more than one artist with this name!!! 

Hi folks! We are a melodic - metal band from Slovakia. We've established Dark Side in summer 2006. First two member Mrco and Hotell played together for 2 months.Then they invited second guitarist Edy and in fall 2006 was the band completed, as the bass guitarist Toudy accepted the offer to play with Dark Side. And so we play and we're enjoying it well. And we hope you will enjoy our music too... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Side">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
