Damon Palermo has been making adventurous house and disco music under the moniker Magic Touch since August 2011. In a short time the producer/DJ has amassed an impressive following and several well-received releases, kicking off with the critically-lauded 100% Silk release “I Can Feel The Heat,” which was a recommended release of the week at Boomkat and made 20JazzFunkGreats Best of 2011 list. More recently he released a split 12″ with close collaborator Ital.

Magic Touch live sets mix the psychedelic ethos of San Francisco with the house movements of Chicago, Detroit and smatters the whole thing with a solid nod to the UK rave underground. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Magic+Touch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
