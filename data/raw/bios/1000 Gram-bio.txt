Moritz Lieberkühn grew up ploughing through the records of his older brothers. Dinosaur Jr, Sonic Youth, Sebadoh and The Smiths where bands that made a great impact on him and in the Berlin suburb he started his first band with some friends. After highscool Moritz continued to perform as a singer-songwriter at local venues. Meeting his wife Anna Roxenholt (New Found Land) in 2007 and moving together with her to Gothenburg, Sweden, brought an important change of environment. He there got to know the musicians Alexander Simm, Jacob Öhrvall and Joel Wästberg with whom he then formed 1000 GRAM. While working at the Gothenburg String Theory (an ongoing collaboration between Berlin and Gothenburg artists) Moritz bumped into his highschool friend and now producer Tilman Hopf, who suggested that they'd do an album together.
Based upon Moritz songwriting the band plays wayward music with very little hipster factor but instead a big portion of heart and individuality. The recognition value is high, at the same time as the music will surprise with its unexpected forms and harmonies. The album was recorded in Chez Cherie in Berlin Neukölln, during two extremely hot summer weeks. The result is a debut directly from the heart with a lot of blood, sweat and thought behind. We are happy to present: 1000 GRAM - Ken Sent Me.
