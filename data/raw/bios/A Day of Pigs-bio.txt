A DAY OF PIGS: Lecherous... Could any single moniker possibly be more apt for the times in which we live? Truth is betrayal. Loss, greed and apathy are the mind-numbing norm. Civilization, if it ever existed at all, has collapsed, and we’re all drowning in the afterbirth of a new nihilism; crouching, afraid, desensitized to each other’s suffering, and most of all, depraved. The hopelessness of our culture has a name — we live in A Day Of Pigs. On their Spare Change debut, Lecherous, the NJ-based band rip open the chest of our violent worldview with a barrage of raging noise storms and painful dirges both brutal and addictive in an effort to expose the wreck of humanity for what it is. While others pose themselves on hilltops and proclaim godliness, A Day of Pigs hollows out the mountains beneath, an ever-moving, ever-changing subversive force, working against trend, convention and banality alike. They owe allegiance to no genre, influence, tempo or gimmick. Guitarist Steve Silberg’s grime-encrusted riffs slither around the amorphous rhythms of drummer Bill "Bixby" Belford, as bassist T.J. lays the low-end foundation on which Kevin LeBlanc launches forth his scathing, poison-drenched vocals, heralding a personal apocalypse with an honesty as brutal as the music behind it. Treading the inner sanctums of the mind and unlocking doors thought best left alone, A Day of Pigs is more than mere negativity. They represent every cruelness in the nature of our defunct reality. Following no man, seeking nothing from above, they wish to trample underfoot the masses as they march hand-in-hand over the falls. Kevin LeBlanc: Vocals... Steve “Meat” Silberg: Guitar...
