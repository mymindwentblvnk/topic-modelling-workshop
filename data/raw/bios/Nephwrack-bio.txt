Nephwrack were formed in late 2001, consisting of a line-up from which only guitarist Ed Simmonds remains today. This band, which for a time included guitarist David Stanton (of Season's End) and Paul White (now with Nya), toured extensively and released two demo CDs, and ultimately an EP in 2004.
  
After a hiatus in 2004/05, 2006 saw the band return with a new line-up featuring Ed's songwriting partner from various other projects, Keir Cleland, on bass and powerhouse drummer Joe Butterworth (now with Interlock). With a clearer vision of their sound, the band wrote debut album The Once and Future King over the period of 2 or 3 months in the autumn/winter of 2006, and committed it to disc that December. It was released independently in March 2007, and garnered the band national attention in the form of features & reviews in Metal Hammer & Kerrang! among others, as well as radio play on BBC6 Music. 

The remainder of 2007 & first half of 2008 was spent gigging (including a slot at Bloodstock Open Air) and promoting the album, and the band are currently writing for the next LP, due to be released winter 08/09. The line-up today consists of Jamie Arnold on drums, Keir Cleland on bass, Paul May and Ed Simmonds on guitar and the most recent addition, vocalist Dilian Arnaudov (formerly of Bulgarian power metal act SJK). 

Disbanded in February 2012
