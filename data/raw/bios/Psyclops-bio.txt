There is more than one artist with this name:

1. A groove metal band based in Cambridge, New Zealand. Formed in 1994, they soon had a 5 track EP called "Defaced" recorded and out on cassette. All their own material, Psyclops rose rapidly to become one of New Zealand's top metal bands of the time. Hamilton radio station 93FM picked up on the group and things just grew from that. They practised hard and their final demise came because outside demands on the members grew to the point where they could not practise at all. Line-up: Jeremy Cole (bass/vocals), Chris Cole (guitar), Adam Wyatt (guitar), Dylan Raethel (drums). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/psyclops">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
