Hailing from Italy Figure of Six were originally heavily influenced by Hardcore bands, but soon turned their music into something completely different, evolving the FO6 sound with the introduction of electronic & melodic complicity. Now, Figure Of Six is a band that is impossible to categorize and hardly can be described with a certain label. 
Amazing and melodic choruses are fused within a focused groove. Meanwhile keyboards, samples, guitarsynths and electronic elements support this fantastic raw-but-still-catchy sound to create a journey through dark, futuristic atmospheres and spacy melodies.

In 2004 the band recorded its first album “Step One” with producer Riccardo Pasini and signed a contract deal to Copro Records (Earthtone 9, Panic Cell, Mendeed) which reached a good response from radios and magazines. Some of the songs contained in the “Step One” album have been airplayed on BBC, also by Bruce Dickinson on his Saturday radio show.

In June 2006 the band shot a video for the song “Go Away” which has been broadcasted by music channels like MTV (Holland) and Rock Tv (Italy)

In September 2006 the band toured around Uk for a promotional 10 gigs tour playing with some good bands like Panic Cell, Vert, Atomic Ants, Psylence, Losing Sun and kicking some serious ass at London Underworld, Manchester Satan hollow and Milton Keynes The Pitz. FO6 shared the stage also with Dillinger Escape Plan, Poison The Well and Dry Kill Logic. 

Figure Of Six has just recorded the new album at Studio 73 with producer Riccardo “Paso” Pasini (Slowmotion Apocalypse, Ephel Duath) and renowned producer Tue Madsen (Sick of it All, The Haunted, Dark Tranquillity, Mnemic) took care of mixing and mastering duties. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Figure+of+Six">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
