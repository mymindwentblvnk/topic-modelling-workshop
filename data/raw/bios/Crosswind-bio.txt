There are multiple bands named Crosswind:
1. a Greek heavy metal band
2. a US (North Carolina) blues/hard rock band
3. a US (Texas) rock band, with heavy Christian influences

1. The band first got together in '96 and had their first demo titled "Dark Omens" in '98. After that the band split for 6 years with members leaving for personal reasons, moving to different countries and all sorts of Spinal Tap-ean situations arising... Despite the fact that due to this situation promotion of the material was pretty much non existant, the demo found its way to the underground, getting extremely good reviews.

The founding members Kyriakos and drummer Vasilis started the band again in 2005. Their sole purpose, to create and play music without any compromises, blending the finest ingredients of what makes Metal so great. Speed, power, melody and substance. Crosswind's sound can be described as the fusion of NWOBHM's melody, German Power Metal's speed and technique and American Heavy Metal's epic sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crosswind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
