There are two bands with the same name.


1) Formed right outside of the Nation's capitol in Northern Virginia, Ave Maria is a combination of artists from various other area bands. Fronted by the melodious and intriguing vocals of Jon Miele(Guitars/Vocals), Ave Maria, who also consists of Paul Heath(Drums) and Brandon Ryan(Bass), present an alternative rock/modern rock sound with slight influences of metal and pop, yet are often compared to the developed stylings of Breaking Benjamin and Chevelle. Formed in late 2011, Ave Maria was quick to start writing and recording, releasing an eight song EP titled Under the Sun in July 2012, which instantly casts the listeners into Ave Maria's world of melodic leads, catchy instrumentals and soaring vocals. This is just a small taste of the rock Ave Maria has in store for its fans as they finish up their full length debut album, slated for release in Fall 2012. The recording studio is only partially home for the members of the band, having spent a lot of time on stage, playing countless shows, to include playing along side national acts such as Trapt, The Classic Crime, The Bigger Lights, Norma Jean, Job for a Cowboy and also playing festivals like M.E.A.N.Y. fest in New York City.

2) Ave Maria is an experimental psychedelic black metal band from Germany who began in 2005. Currently signed with Kult of Nihilow/Ahdistuksen Aihio Productions, they recently released a new LP entitled 'Chapter I'.
Their lyrics focus mainly on Religion, Trance and The Human Mind <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ave+Maria">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
