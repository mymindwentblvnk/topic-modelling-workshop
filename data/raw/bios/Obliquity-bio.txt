Obliquity is a project by Ross Baker, recording and releasing more synthesised music than his main project Second Thought.
Obliquity I, a short collection improvised synth and drone pieces, came out on experimental music label aReW Recordings in early 2011.  Obliquity II was much grander, having started life as a potential Second Thought album, and bore obvious influence from 90s ambient techno, ambient dub and Berlin School electronica.  The album was released on the Bump Foot label in summer 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Obliquity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
