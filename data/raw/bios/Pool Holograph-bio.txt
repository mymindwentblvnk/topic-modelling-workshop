Beginning as Wyatt Grant’s bedroom project around a decade ago, he says Pool Holograph “the band” was not realized until the joining of Zach Stuckmann (bass), and brothers Jacob and Paul Stolz (percussion and lead guitar) in 2015. Since that point, the group maintained a consistent presence in Chicago’s indie music scene, while just as consistently reconstructing their sound and ethos.

As it was completed in early 2020, Love Touched Time and Time Began to Sweat comes from the not-too-distant time of physical contact with friends and family, and the familiar cycle of rehearsals, shows, and DJ sets. However, the writing and recording of this album was fraught with determination to reshape the group’s approach to making music. The album features a slew of new strategies for the band including their first guest contributions (V.V. Lightbody and Spencer Ouellette of REZN), clear vocal delivery, and a newfound embrace of very minimal instrumentation. Frequently deemed a group of “art rockers”, the band has long held an interest in pursuing transgressive, oblique strategies in their writing and recording (ex: voice memos through pickups, canned air solos, samples of night walks through the country), however their newest album wastes no time in conjuring the wild but essential heart of the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pool+Holograph">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
