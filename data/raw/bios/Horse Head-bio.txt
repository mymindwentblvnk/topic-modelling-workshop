Growing up in Orange County, California, Horse Head was the frontman of various bands, most notably forming the indie trio Tan Dollar in 2010. In 2013, he began to deviate from performing in groups, producing various hip-hop beat tapes instead. Horse Head soon joined the underground musical collective Thraxxhouse, connecting with artists Cold Hart, Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, and Lil Tracy. The frequent collaborators quickly formed their own niche collective: GothBoiClique. As a member of the renowned group, Horse Head released a triad of projects in 2016, including True Blue, Celebrity Crush, and Lock & Key. Horse Head also produced numerous tracks for the late Lil Peep’s breakthrough mixtapes Crybaby and Hellboy, and also featured as a vocalist on their notable single “Girls” and “Stop the Car.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Horse+Head">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
