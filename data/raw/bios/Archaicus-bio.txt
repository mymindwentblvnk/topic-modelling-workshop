Archaicus is an atmospheric black metal band formed in 2002 with 2 official demos: 'Beneath the Horizon' (2003), and 'The Elder Scape' (2004). 

See: www.vorfeed.net/archaicus

The first demo, 'Beneath the Horizon', does not really explicitly resemble any other band's style.  It is a mixture of dark sounding ambient/classical guitar parts interspersed with semi-'De Mysteriis...' sounding black metal and possibly a black/thrash metal feeling in some moments.
