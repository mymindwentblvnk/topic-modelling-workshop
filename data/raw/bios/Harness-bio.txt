2. Harness hails from the festering underground scene of portland/salem oregon.  After years and years of scouring the area, Bryan finally found someone to aid him in his axe slinging; a transplant from Indiana whom we refer to as Heathcliff.  Instant chemistry was created and the two joined forces to bring life to the sounds that had been laying dormant in the harness vault for several years.  In Late 2007 they began production on their first E.P. (Prepare For War) at Geomana studios with a fill in studio drummer by the name of Andrew Green.  Upon completion of the E.P. released in mid 2008, they now set out to deliver the sounds to the ears of the local citizens.  Aaron Coalbank of Salem was soon acquired to do the duty of bashing the skins on stage, and now it is proceeding at full force.  Early to mid 2009 will see the release of the full length album entitled "Sleeping Giant" which will include all 4 tracks from the first E.P. with an additional 5 tracks.  The time is fast approaching,.....Prepare For War. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Harness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
