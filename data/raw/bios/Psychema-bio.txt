Psychema was born in 2007 from a wedding band project as Tomi, Timo and Kimmo were alarmed to play a gig for friend’s wedding. So, the challenge was to practice lots of cool cover songs (and a few waltzes too…) within one week. All band members had live gig experience (together and separately) on similar events and finally the actual wedding gig was, of course, a great success. The chemistry within the band was just too good to be thrown away and the band started talking about composing and recording new music together. The first sessions took place in early 2008 at Kimmo’s home studio and Repetitive Moments was the first song to be finished, followed by Semilucidity and About Face during the summer. That’s when Petja joined the band. He also had earlier experiences playing with Tomi and Timo and was a natural choice for bass. In summer 2010 Esa Mikkola was recruited as keyboard player, but unfortunately he decided to leave the band in 2011 because he wanted to concentrate on guitar playing in his other band. Luckily a replacement was near. Vesa was already playing with Kimmo in other band and was recruited in no time. And so Psychema was back in it’s current top form.

Psychema’s music is a mixture of its members’ musical preferences. Common element is heavy and metallic sound with some progressive elements, melodic/brutal vocals and dark atmosphere. Guitars are strongly present, of course. Lyrics, written by Tomi, are stories about life and its mysteries. Tomi’s multi-talented voice also makes it possible to add more exciting elements into music. Overall, combining all these elements… that’s how the Psychemic soundscape is created.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Psychema">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
