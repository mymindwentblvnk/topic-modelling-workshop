Ivan Moravec (b. 9 November 1930) is a Czech concert pianist whose performing and recording career, spanning nearly half a century, has gained him a world-wide following.

He is widely acclaimed for his compelling readings of major recital works by Chopin, Debussy, Beethoven, and Mozart, as well as Czech composers. He has played with most of the world's main symphony orchestras, and his active concerto repertoire has included more than a dozen works by Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Schumann, Ravel, Prokofiev, and Franck. Moravec has been a dedicated piano teacher at home in Prague, and frequently gives master classes when he travels.

Both Moravec's performances and the lifelike sound of his Connoisseur Society recordings remain legendary; long after the LP era, the latter are still often cited as reference recordings on audiophile web sites.[2] Nearly all of them remain available today through reissues on CD. In recent years Moravec has recorded for several other labels, including Vox, Dorian, HÃ¤nssler, and Supraphon, to no less critical acclaim. In 1998 a 2-CD compilation of Ivan Moravec recordings was published in the landmark Philips series, Great Pianists of the 20th Century.
