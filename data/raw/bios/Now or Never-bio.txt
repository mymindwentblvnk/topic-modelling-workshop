Now or Never formed in the summer of 2008. The lyrics are created through collaboration with each member of the band. Their music evolved from life changing experiences stemming from mistakes they have endured. One major goal of the lyrics and music created is to produce subjects that can be related to by a broad majority of listeners. Now or Neverâ€™s live performances show the bands energy, musical talents and dedication to insuring their audiences are satisfied. They have recorded 5 songs that are included in their recently released self entitled EP. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Now+Or+Never">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
