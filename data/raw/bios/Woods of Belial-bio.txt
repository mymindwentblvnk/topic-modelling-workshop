Mysterious Industrial/Black/Doom act from Finland who's members all play in other well known Metal bands. The band tries to keep the identity of the members a secret however. Musically the band sounds like being hit by a sledgehammer. Very heavy, slow, monotonous riffing accompanied by an organ. Both keys and guitars seem equally important, but the band never falls into any Gothic clich√©'s and remains ultra heavy all the time. Brooding dark music. Don't let the "Industrial" frighten you from checking this band out, if you enjoy Funeral Doom or very slow Black-Doom then you will like this band as well (think of a more brooding version of the first Dolorian album). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Woods+of+Belial">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
