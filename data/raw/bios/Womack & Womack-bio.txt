Cecil D. Womack (25th September 1947 - 1st February 2013), is one of the famous musical Womack brothers. Although lesser known than his elder brother Bobby, he has had some success both as a songwriter and recording artist.

Born in Cleveland, Ohio.

Womack and his brothers were a gospel group. They changed their name to the Valentinos and became protégés of Sam Cooke.

Cecil became the second husband of Motown star Mary Wells in 1967. Together they had three children: Cecil Jr, Stacy and Harry.

After their 1977 divorce, Wells married Cecil's other brother, Curtis Womack.

Cecil next married Linda Cooke, the daughter of Sam Cooke. This created scandal because Cecil's brother Bobby Womack married Sam Cooke's widow Barbara Campbell in March 1965, just 3 months after Sam Cooke's December 1964 murder.

In 1983, under the name of Womack & Womack, Cecil and Linda released a successful album, "Love Wars", and continued to make albums until 1991. Their song "Love Wars" was covered by The Beautiful South for the 1990 compilation Rubáiyát. Their most successful single was "Teardrops". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Womack+&+Womack">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
