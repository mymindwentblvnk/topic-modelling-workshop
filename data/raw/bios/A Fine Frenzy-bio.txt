A Fine Frenzy was the initial recording name of American singer, songwriter, pianist and actor Alison Sudol (born December 23, 1984 in Seattle, Washington). The first studio album One Cell In The Sea was released on 17 July 2007. The first single, "Almost Lover", peaked at number 25 on US Billboard's Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. There have been no releases since 2012. On 24 November 2017, Alison Sudol released "Enough Honey", the debut single under her own name; an album under her own name followed in 2018.

In an interview with www.spinner.com, Sudol shared how she came up with the name "(I) had a bunch of books open on a table, "a fine frenzy" jumped off a page of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' [Shakespeare] and it was just right, though every now and then I wonder if it's a bit ... flowery."

Sudol developed the sound of A Fine Frenzy - hypnotic piano arrangements under classic American melody fused into irresistible, atmospheric songs with the power to reach around the world.

The second album, Bomb in a Birdcage, was released on 8 September 2009. A third album, Pines, was released in 2012.
