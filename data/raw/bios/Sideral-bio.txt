Aleix Vergés AKA Sideral (Barcelona, 1973-2006) wasn't always known as the famous DJ he had become. He had been the leader of Peanut Pie, an indie pop with subtle dance influences group with a very short life, they only released an album, with the same name (Peanut Pie). The group vanished while Aleix was starting his sessions as Sideral in the barcelonese club known as Nitsa Club.

His sessions catched the attention of die-hard independent pop and rock addicts and made them give a chance to the electronic scene, mostly because he used to mix techno and electro hits with traditional pop.

He also obtained a residence in The Kitchen club of Ireland (propietry of Bono (U2)).

In 2001 he published his first mix-album as Sideral, 'Darkhouz & Pop-o-Tronic', a double album that purposes two different styles in each disc. Electronic Pop and House as Aleix Vergés.

Two years later, he edits 'Schizotronic & Techno', this time under his own label, Hit Kune Do (a wink to Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do. Bruce Lee was one of Aleix's idols). 

Aleix left us on 19 May 2006 due to a heart failure. He was preparing his third album as a DJ and an acoustic disc.
