Against Evil is heavy metal band from the city of Visakhapatnam (India) formed in 2014 by Shasank (Lead Guitar), Siri (Bass Guitar / Vocals), Sravan (Rhythm Guitar / Vocals) and Noble John (Drums).

Influenced by heavy metal bands such as Judas Priest, Accept, Megadeth, Dio, etc, the band is crafting their own style of metal - Old School Heavy Metal with A Modern Sound!

After releasing their highly successful and critically acclaimed album "Fatal Assault" in 2015, Against Evil are back with a brand new studio album in 2018 titled "ALL HAIL THE KING" featuring 9 tracks of blistering in-your-face heavy metal.

With heart-pounding drums, crushing guitars and melodic vocals, this album will take you back to the good old days of heavy metal. To top that, the band has collaborated with world famous shred guitar player Jeff Loomis (Arch Enemy, Nevermore, Conquering Dystopia) who has delivered a face-melting guitar solo on one of the tracks titled "Sentenced to Death"
