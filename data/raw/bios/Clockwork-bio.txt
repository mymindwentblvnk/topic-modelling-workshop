They played a combination of symphonic prog and complex technical metal. For reference, think a mixture of Yes and Dream Theater. Their material featured lush keyboards that provided the backdrop for dual lead guitars, layered vocals and a tight rhythm section.  Unfortunately, they disbanded after the release of their only full-length album entitled "Surface Tension" in 1999. Their only other release was an self-released EP entitled "Search", released in 1997.

They started jamming and got connected to Bas. During a jam with the three of them there was some sort of magic and they decided to form a band. Just four rehearsals old they played seven Dream Theater songs during their first show (at their former school). 
The band has finished recording their first demo track. Itâ€™s an instrumental song named The Discovery.
In 2008-2009 they finally got a whole band together. Rob Bolk (vocals) and Sjon Bremmer joined their little club. In 2009 writing and recording started for the first Album called "Dawn" which was released in November 2010. http://www.clockworkband.net/
