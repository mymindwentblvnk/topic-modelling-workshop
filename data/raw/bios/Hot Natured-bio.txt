Hot Natured is a British-American electronic music group consisting of Jamie Jones and Lee Foss, both co-founders of critically acclaimed electronic dance music label, Hot Creations. The group later on added members Ali Love and Luca Cazal from Infinity Ink.

All four are acclaimed producers, DJs and musicians in their own right but their coming together as one has the potential to take things to another level completely. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hot+Natured">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
