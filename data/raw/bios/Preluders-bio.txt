The Preluders were an all-female band from Germany, formed in 2003 during the third season of the international television talent show Popstars - Das Duell. Originally a quintet and later a quartet, the group eventually became a trio. After a relatively unsuccessful period since 2004 the three remaining girls disbanded amicably without any kind of media circus in fall 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Preluders">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
