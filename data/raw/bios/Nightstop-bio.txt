NightStop hails from Jyväskylä, Finland to bring you fresh new retro 80's electric sounds . The music is strongly influenced by blast from the 80's cyberpunk movies, video games and beautiful girls with big hair.

NightStop is specifically intended for your HIFI stereo cassette player as you drive your Ferrari F40 into Miami nights. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nightstop">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
