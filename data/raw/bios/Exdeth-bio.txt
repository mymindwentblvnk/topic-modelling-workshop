In March 2008, Vinnie, Jack, Kheel, Hellgate and Jordan formed the Metal Band "Exdeth"

At first it was only as a cover band and they played covers by artist like:
Metallica, Anthrax, Suicidal Tendencies, Sepultura, Venom etc.

After a while they wanted to write their own songs and deicided to continue as a Thrash Metal Band.

In August 2009 the Bassist Jordan left the band and the remaining 4 continued without a Bassist.

The current Vocalist Vinnie would rather like to ba a part of the band as a Bassist than a singer,
so instead of searching for a new Bassist they deicided to look for a new Vocalist.

And then in the begining of 2010 Martin from Sweden joined Exdeth as their new Vocalist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Exdeth">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
