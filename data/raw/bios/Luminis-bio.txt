Luminis is a NJ based gothic symphonic metal band in the likes of Nightwish, Epica, and Within Temptation. With only two core members who write and record every song on their own, this band has accomplished a lot in the past year, including a recent debut EP release entitled ‘From Within’. Plans for a full-length album are in the works with an expected release in the final quarter of 2011.

Luminis’s music incorporates beautiful, almost innocent sounding, orchestral melodies which include a more frequent use of the piano. The lyrics focus on psychodynamic conflicts and the intrapsychic pain experienced by those dealing with mental illness. They also portray the many diverse and sometimes imaginative ways by which those afflicted learn to cope.

Luminis began as a symphonic metal tribute act which then led to increased interest from fans to hear original material from the band. This paved the way for Luminis to begin its personal, artistic, and fresh direction. Live performances are accompanied by stage musicians and enhanced with minor acting scenes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Luminis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
