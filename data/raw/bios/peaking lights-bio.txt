Peaking Lights is Aaron and Indra from Rahdunes and Numbers. Their duo project finds them relocated to Madison/ Rural Wisconsin from the Bay Area. One could describe their new sound as floating electronic pulses, controlled feedback, tape loops, organ, synth, guitar, and vocal harmonies layered into waves of four track noise pop goodness. In short, they're the perfect soundtrack to walking through mysterious places, haunted neighborhoods, lost river banks, and going on stoned bike rides at night. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Peaking+Lights">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
