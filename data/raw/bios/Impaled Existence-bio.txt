Impaled Existence is a 5-piece progressive death metal band from North Wales, UK. Forming in 2004, the band has grown and matured into a finely tuned combination of brutality, odd-timed grooves and melody. 

Influences Range from various metal bands, brutal and melodic, such as: WHITECHAPEL, AFTER THE BURIAL, VEIL OF MAYA & IN FLAMES, just to name a few. 

2011 saw the band take that next step by winning the Metal 2 The Masses competition to play that year's BLOODSTOCK FESTIVAL on the New Blood Stage, this gave the band great exposure and gained more fans to the IMEX ARMY. The same year the band released the critically acclaimed E.P 'THESE LIFELESS PLAINS' which was released Worldwide via iTunes, Amazon MP3 and all other major Download websites. Physical copies showcasing the amazing artwork by Darkgrove Media are also available via the band's Big Cartel Webstore. 

The band continued to gain momentum in 2012 by winning the King Of The Stage competition to play DOWNLOAD FESTIVAL on the Pepsi Max stage. 2012 also sees the band's first UK tour where the band will be unleashing waves of new material. The 'DestrUKtion Tour 2012' kicks off this September, check the tour dates tab for more info!
