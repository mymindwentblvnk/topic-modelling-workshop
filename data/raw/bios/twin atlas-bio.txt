INCORRECT ARTIST TAG!  Please change your artist tags to The Twin Atlas.

Music by The Twin Atlas is usually atmospheric folk & pop songs, written and home-recorded by Sean Byrne with Lucas Zaleski, who began playing together when they met at the University of Delaware in the early '90s and began releasing music as The Twin Atlas in 2000.

Zaleski is now an NYC resident and Byrne lives in Philadelphia where he has drummed with the bands Lenola, Mazarin, Matt Pond PA, Audible and BC Camplight.

The foundation of their songs often come from Byrne's compositions or from Byrne & Zaleski's recorded collaborations and improvisations, upon which Byrne later goes back to and finishes; adding vocals, additional melodies & instrumentation, and assorted sounds. This work process has proved prolific to say the least.

Their 2005 release Sun Township was a ten song set of haunting folk rock containing their most fully realized fidelity to date thanks to post-production by engineer Dave Grubb (Lenola, Like A Fox)

In late 2006 the group released Magic Car Wash , a mini-album set of songs & instrumentals originally begun in the 'Sun Township' sessions which were finished during the summer of '06

The Twin Atlas plays: acoustic & electric guitar, vocals, mandolin, keyboard, live & electronic drums, harmonica, banjo, effects, melodica, percussion, as well as whatever and whoever may be laying around at the time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Twin+Atlas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
