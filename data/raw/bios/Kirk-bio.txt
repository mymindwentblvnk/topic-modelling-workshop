There is more than one artist with this name: 

1. Kirk is a Polish experimental band from Warszawa, Poland.

Hard, electronic beats merge into the squelching, organic structure. The rattling, breathing trumpet fills the air along with the harsh, dusty samples. Technical precision intertwines with the free thought of jazz and audacious attitude of hip-hop. Every one of their concerts is a sound continuum. Kirk builds up a wonky yet steady structure just to deform it and convert it into newer and newer compositions. It’s all about broadening the boundaries of expression, merging the synthetic with the organic.

Members:

Paweł Bartnik - electronics;
Olgierd Dokalski - trumpet;
Filip Kalinowski - turntable.
