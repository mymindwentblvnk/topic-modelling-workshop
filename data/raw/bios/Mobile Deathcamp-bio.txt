While touring with Gwar as Beefcake The Mighty, Todd decided it was high time to switch back to his original instrument, guitar, find the right comrades, and begin melting faces with the style of music they REALLY felt in their loins...

Enter the Glass City's latest abomination, MOBILE DEATHCAMP ! !

A vicious metal trio, made up of Northwest Ohio, and Southeast Michigan musical journeymen. These three metal "war horses" have been rippin' it up like this since the FIRST time this style was popular !
