Hedonistic Exility was founded in April 2007 by two guitarists – Led & Butcher, whose goal was to play fast, but atmospheric death metal. On Summer 2007 a drummer Dimitrius (Ex-Authority) and bassist Sanya (Ex-Hunger Dispatch) joined the band, with which Hedonistic Exility prepared a show program consisted of 5 songs and presented it first time in Kiev in February 2008.
On Summer 2008 band took aim to considerable increase in complexity of the material paying attention to it’s technical skills and musicality and joining together Eastern, Egyptian and Neoclassical melodies with cacophony and hypertechnicity of modern technical brutal death metal.
On Autumn 2008 Hedonistic Exility was completed with extremely talented female bass player Hel (Ex-Gloom of Doom) and most powerful vocalist Slash, and the band prepared new slaughtering show program which was presented on January 31, 2009 in Kiev. The audience who visited this gig and made the small club bulging at the seams appreciated very highly a musicality and technicity of the band, drawing a parallel with such famous bands as Nile (US) and Beneath The Massacre (Canada).
Next two live-sessions in Kharkov city in Churchill and Heat clubs have only consolidated for Hedonistic Exility a status of very perspective technical brutal death metal band with large development potential.
At the moment Hedonistic Exility is working on recording of it’s debut EP, which will contain most musically complex and technical material – from ultrafast gravity blasts and insane riffs to punishing breakdowns.
