Band stories typically begin with a couple of musicians jamming, then finding other people to play drums or sing. This is a story you have read online a hundred times describing a band.

Dei Aemeth is not one of these bands.

As each Dei Aemeth member has joined, there is an immediate sense of camaraderie like they have known each other all their lives. There is a sense of recognition, a striking "have we met before" moment. Kindred spirits? Most certainly. Comrades in arms from past lives? Possibly. Instead of "magic" when Dei Aemeth plays, there is "magick" - a sense of ritualistic spell-casting.

The Dei Aemeth sound can be described as avant-garde metal, progressive metal or wizard metal. The music is more channeled than played, more interpreted from ancient scrolls than composed. The Dei Aemeth audience is infamous for snarling vortex-like mosh pits with a heavy metal velocity that will steal the breath of any living soul, and do not forget the staggeringly high bar tabs.

In this particular lifetime, Dei Aemeth began to take its current shape in 2007 in Dallas, TX. The summoning commenced by guitarist and composer Sam Paquette, who was joined by Carl Ferre-Lang on bass. Within a few years Vale Ethereal joined on vocals, followed by Simple Nomad on keyboards.
