Sunset Nation was formed in 2006 when vocalist Bryan Ross recruited guitarist Dagger Phoenix. After auditioning and rehearsing with numerous other musicians, bassist SÃ­on Smang joined the group in 2007. Drummer Sev then cemented the lineup in 2008. After having played only a single show, Sunset Nation made national headlines in 2009 when they were banned from the World Famous Whisky-A-Go-Go on the Sunset Strip after Whisky management pulled the plug during the band's set. The highly publicized incident was covered by Fox News and inspired the band's hit "Banned from Hell", which is featured on the band's debut album, "Fuck the Machine". The band produces, records, mixes, and masters their music by themselves. On January 4th 2011, Sunset Nation released six new songs as mp3 downloads available from their Myspace and Facebook pages as well as their official website. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sunset+Nation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
