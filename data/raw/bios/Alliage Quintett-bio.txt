Alliage" is probably the most charming alloy (French: alliage) of four saxophones and piano. Unique in its instrumentation, the ensemble, which has won two ECHO Klassik awards, makes the illusion of a large orchestra a reality. The melodic and at the same time expressive sounding saxophones meet the orchestral fullness of a piano and thus create a new listening experience of the highest quality.

The founder is the Canadian Daniel Gauthier, primarius on the soprano saxophone. He received the first professorship for classical saxophone in Germany in 1997 and has been teaching as a professor at the Hochschule für Musik in Cologne since 2003. Playing with him are some of the best soloists of the classical saxophone at present: Miguel Valles, alto saxophone, Simon Hanrath, tenor saxophone, and Sebastian Pottmeier, baritone saxophone. The Korean pianist Jang Eun Bae completes the quintet.

The repertoire focuses on famous masterpieces of all epochs in compositionally finely sounded and refined arrangements for saxophone quartet and piano. All arrangements are written for the Alliage Quintett and are created in close collaboration between the ensemble and the respective composer: for example, the Japanese Jun Nagao or the Dutch Wijnand van Klaveren as well as congenial arrangers such as Reiner Schottstädt and Hendrik Schnöke and ensemble member Sebastian Pottmeier write for this extraordinary chamber music instrumentation.
