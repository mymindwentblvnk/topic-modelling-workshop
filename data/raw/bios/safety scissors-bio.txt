Safety Scissors is Matthew Patterson Curry, a minimal techno artist born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He moved to the San Francisco Bay Area for a short while in order to attend art school. Curry then decided to focus more on music, and eventually joined "Belief Systems/Context Records" where he began working with Kit Clayton, Sutekh, and Twerk. Curry also performs with Seth Horvitz (aka Sutekh) under the name Moron. In 2000, he moved to Berlin.
Curry has released three full length albums, Parts Water in 2001, Tainted Lunch (released on Stefan Behnke's ~scape label) in 2005, and Pigeon Funk Presents!!! with Sutekh.
He also collaborated with Kit Clayton on an EP entitled Ping Pong, which sped through three dozen tracks in under 20 minutes. Ping Pong was part of Carpark Records' sports-FAN series, so named because each release was pressed on a Fan CD. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Safety+Scissors">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
