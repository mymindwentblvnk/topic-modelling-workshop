Formed in 1993 by Rob D.Fornicator, Whore Murder Basket was bent on destroying everything in its path with their lust for alcohol, women, cross dressing and hate.  They played shows that often resulted in fights breaking out, piss drinking or dead animals on stage. For 3 years the terrorized the quad cities and this is the story of one of Illinois' heaviest unknown bands.  They recorded 2 demos, the 1st demo (which was self-titled) and one entitled Demo #666 in 1993.  They recorded a 2nd demo simply entitled Demo #2 in 1996.
