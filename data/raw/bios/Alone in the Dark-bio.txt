Alone in the Dark is a Brit now living in Australia.  After fighting the emo wars of the early 2000s, Alone in the Dark (aitd to his friends) left the UK for exile on the other side of the world.  Somewhere along the way he realised that he really liked late 80s house.  There was something in the crude vocal samples, lo fi aesthetic and jarring mixing that struck a chord. So, with nothing other than a rudimentary musical training and some surprising complicated musical program's he decided to start making it himself.
