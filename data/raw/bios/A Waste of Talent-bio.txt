A Waste of Talent was founded by Skaperen and Vrangsinn 1992 as
Psycodelic Steamtrain. After 15 years of waiting for the end of the world,
Skaperen and Vrangsinn decided it was time to fuck it all and finally start
recording some of the material. With all the forces in the universe against
them, they keep on fighting to get this album ready before
the end of everything. Who will win this race against time itself??
