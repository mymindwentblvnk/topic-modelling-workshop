Eagles of Death Metal is an American rock band which formed in Palm Desert, California in 1998. The band consists of Jesse Hughes (vocals, guitar) and Josh Homme (drums), who are also the only constant members of the band. The current touring lineup consists of Hughes, Dave Catching (guitar), Eden Galindo (guitar), Jennie Vee (bass) and Jorma Vik (drums). Homme rarely tours with the band due to commitments with Queens of the Stone Age, with Vik, an ex-member of The Bronx, being his current touring replacement.

The band has released four albums since their formation: "Peace, Love, Death Metal" (2004), "Death by Sexy" (2006), "Heart On" (2008) and "Zipper Down" (2015). Despite their band name, Eagles of Death Metal is not a death metal band. Hughes stated that a friend was introducing Josh Homme to the death metal genre. When he played a song by the Polish band Vader and made a claim that the song was within the death metal genre, Homme then referred to Vader as "The Eagles of Death Metal". After hearing this phrase, he wondered what a cross between the Eagles and a death metal band would sound like. In a 2003 interview Homme described the sound of the band as a combination of "bluegrass slide guitar mixed with stripper drum beats and Canned Heat vocals." Jesse Hughes is known by fans for his enthusiastic interaction with audiences at live performances.

While the band were on stage at Le Bataclan in Paris, France, on November 13, 2015, the audience was attacked by terrorists wielding automatic rifles, grenades and suicide vests. The death toll inside the venue was 89, including the group's merchandise manager, but the band members made it safely out of the venue via a door backstage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eagles+of+Death+Metal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
