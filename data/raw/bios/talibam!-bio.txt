Audio terrorists Talibam! is a NYC duo formed by Kevin Shea (member in bands like Storm & Stress, Coptic Light and People) who plays drums, and Matt Mottel (synth).
In 2007, after several limited CDR releases,  they released their first CD studio album on Azul Discografica called 'Ordination of the Globetrotting Conscripts'. For this, they were joined by some of the finest improvisers in New York: Peter Evans (trumpet), Cooper-Moore (piano), Michael Evans (drums), Jeremy Wilms (guitar).
Their music is a playful combination of jazz and noise.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Talibam%21">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
