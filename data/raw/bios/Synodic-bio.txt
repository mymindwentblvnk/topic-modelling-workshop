Synodic is a project focused on actual science of the cosmos. 
Founded in 2017 by Tulsa, Oklahoma-based multi-instrumentalist 
Myrdin Cerphas and lyricist and conceptual artist Imber, in their own words this cosmic black metal band 
aims to be “a factual portrayal of the universe through the music”. 


Imber brought forth the idea of creating Synodic in early February of 2017 
after listening to certain albums in cosmic black metal 
and seeing there was an absence of factual science in the music others created. 
Since Imber and Myrdin lived together it was an easy idea to work on in their own time. 
After writing the lyrics and creating the concept for Prodigious 
Imber then departed Synodic due to conflicts between Myrdin. 


Drawing inspiration from the late astronomer and science 
communicator Carl Sagan, Synodic “hails Sagan rather than Satan”, 
and goes as far as taking one of the scientist’s quotes as a motto: 
“Our imagined self importance, the delusion that we have some 
privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of 
pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping 
cosmic dark”. Portraying the science of astronomy through music, 
Synodic “brings the reality and feeling of the universe together” in sound. 
Distancing from the contemporary black metal scene, Myrdin tries to keep Synodic 
“basic and stripped down, but still expansive in atmosphere”.
