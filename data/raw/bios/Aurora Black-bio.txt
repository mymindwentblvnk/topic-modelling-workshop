Hailing from Los Angeles, CA, Aurora Black was formed in the summer of 2003 with its founding members Adam Estrada and Nick Trujillo. With influences like Enslaved, Behemoth, and Gorgoroth, Estrada and Trujillo were inspired to to take their idea to the next level... 

The band went on to record three independently produced albums over the course of three years.  After several lineup changes, the band gathered the perfect group: Chris Baghdadlian on lead guitar, Adam Estrada on guitar/lead vocals, Nick Trujillo on drums, and Phil Garcia on Bass.

These days, Aurora Blackdevotes most of their energy on their debut album on OMC Records. This album is anticipated as a defining masterpiece of Aurora Black’s career; a massive, 16-song concept album set in a dream-like forest with songs based on real stories of ghosts, murders, human torture, and suffering. Metal barriers will be broken forever with this album, which contains two chapters of epic proportion.

    Chapter one is the most extreme, as it showcases some of Aurora Black's most technical work to date. With the help of the group’s newly added keys,chapter two contains some of the band’s most beautiful and melodically dark music yet. Dedicated to constantly touring and writing music they love, Aurora Black wants to spread their epic darkness to you.
