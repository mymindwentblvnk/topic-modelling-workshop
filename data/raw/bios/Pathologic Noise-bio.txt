Heavy Metal is probably the music style that has split itself into the greater number of genres and tendencies, Death Metal leading in terms of radicalism. Since the beginning, radical themes along with a brutal and fast sound have been its basic identity. Within the borders of Death Metal, Splatter is one of the most recognized styles, its lyrics approaching morbid themes and scatology, often related to the content of terror movies.

Although Splatter is very popular abroad, few Brazilian bands have chosen to follow this music path. Pathologic Noise, a band from the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, is a pioneer in the genre, and its first album has been finally released by Cogumelo Records. The band released two demo tapes - "Necropleasure" (1993) and "Flesh Paradise" (1997) - and played in several local gigs. In 2000 it was chosen to participate in the bastard and anticipated album "Tribute to Sarc√≥fago", with the song "Satanas", released by Cogumelo Records. In 2002 the band started the recording of its debut CD, "Sodomy and Delight on Flesh". The album marks: strength and speed in the right measures, with a very particular characteristic and an overdose of metal feeling. The album was finally released in 2003, and the band, with a new line up, headed for a national tour, brutal and very succesful.

Nowadays, the band is preparing a new tour, and also composing material for a new album.
