The band formed in 2006 in Barcelona, rising from the ashes of a previous effort called Bloodschool. Through many festivals and shows with local bands, they got together a following and a style which could be labeled as melodic death metal but that goes further than that.

It was in 2010 when they released their first demo, containing
four songs. Their drummer, Rubén, opted out and in came Edu Grima. Rubén felt it was better to take charge of the band’s management and he’s done that
ever since. With that change, they were ready to roll and did so with “Waiting for Death”, their first studio effort, released in 2011.
After two years of playing, rehearsing, playing, rehearsing and some more playing and rehearsing, they got again into La Atlantida Studios/La fundició Studio in Barcelona and shaped their sophomore record, the powerful “Planet of the Rapes”.
