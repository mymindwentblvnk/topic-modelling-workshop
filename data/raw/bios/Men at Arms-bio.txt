Men at arms is an Austrian act that dropped two EP's in 1999 named "Vanguard" and "Under Siege" on Craft Records. Their music is rarely spread and available on Vinyl only. 

To get an impression, two tracks of their music are available on the website of Craft Records. The links are:

update 2011: unfortunately the links don't work any longer, Craft Records is already gone since their last release in 2000. The music of Men at Arms is still not available on other medium than vinyl. 

It is not known what happened with the artists behind Men at Arms and if they are still into music. A pity, since their EP's are close to the best Triphop music has to offer.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Men+At+Arms">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
