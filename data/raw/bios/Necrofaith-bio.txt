Necrofaith is an Italian solo black metal project founded by the multi instrument Archdiablesse Proserpina in 2020. She describes her sound as "dark, satanic and raw, no experimental bullshit" for those influences were early Bathory, Darkthrone and Celtic Frost. Lyrical themes evolve around that same darkness and satanism she quoted. Debut album can only be bought on bandcamp as digital album or tape, and the goal of the project is to remain obscure. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necrofaith">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
