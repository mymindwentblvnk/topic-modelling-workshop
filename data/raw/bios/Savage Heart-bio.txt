Savage Heart was formed in Gothenburg, Sweden in the year 2005 with the goal to give you music that is full with energy, great melodies and in the end makes you bang your head!

In 2006 Savage Heart enlisted a singer, Marty, who was the final ingredient of the rock 'n roll ballcrusher Savage Heart is today. Life is a big fucking party, and that is what Savage Heart delivers to you on stage! Join us on our road to hell 'n fame and we will give you a ride that never ends! 

"You're hunting action, you're searching love. An electric chain reaction, like a thunder from above."
