Now and then, a band emerges with a sound so fresh, yet so familiar, that you can't quite explain what it is that makes them rock. A band with melodies that are as catchy as they are quirky, music borne out of the myriad ideas and influences of five distinct individuals. A band ready to plug in and take over the stage with a remarkable pop sensibility, all while creating an edgy sound that's uniquely their own. That band is INVID.

This wildly talented quintet of young guys has a collective creative energy that fuses together into a seamless ensemble sound. INVID has been rocking out with their own brand of post-modern rock and power pop since the spring of 2001. Armed with impossibly catchy hooks and quirky lyrics potent enough to make knees go weak, the guys have built up a loyal fan base in their native Los Angeles. They have played regular gigs in the L.A. bar and club circuit, gracing the stages of such venues as the Knitting Factory, the Whisky, Viper Room, Rainbow Room, Martini Lounge, and Mr. T's Bowl. INVID is always ready to entertain with a high-octane set that compels everyone in the room to get off their asses and rock out. And finally, after two highly successful, locally distributed EP's, the band is ready to step up, guitars blazing.

"Mustard Coffee" is INVID's debut album. With 10 solid tracks of songs bound together with that distinct INVID sound, rock music get bent and twisted to their will without leaving you behind for even a split second. Melodic, driving riffs, pounding rhythms, aggressive bass, sharp lyrics, and bridges from the depths are written all over the album.

INVID is:

Jonathan W. - vocals
Eric P. - lead guitar
Sal E. - rhythmn guitar
Vincent S. - bass
Mark T. - drums
