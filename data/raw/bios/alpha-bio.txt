Alpha débuted with the album "Come From Heaven" (Sept 1997, Melankolic - Massive Attack's label), contributing to expand the famous 'trip-hop' sound. Sixteen years later, Dingley's project continues to push boundaries of electronic music, cloudy pop, hazy dub and dreamlike post-rock. From "Stargazing" (May 2003, Don't Touch) to "Eleventh Trip", through the ethereal instrumentals of "Lost In A Garden Of Clouds Part 1" / "...Part 2" (2004 / Jan 2006, both Don't Touch), the melancholic romances of "The Sky Is Mine" (Sept 2007, Don't Touch) and, collaborating with legendary Jamaican vocalist Horace Andy, the sharp reggae-dub confrontations of "Two Phazed People" (Aug 2009, Don't Touch) - Alpha continues to evolve and remain engaging.

Former members include: Andy Jenks and Peter Wild.
