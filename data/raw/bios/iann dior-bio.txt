Michael Ian Olmo (b. March 25, 1999), better known by his stage name iann dior, is a Puerto-Rican recording artist from Corpus Christi, Texas.

He began releasing music in 2017 under the mononym Olmo, and stage name Lil Rock, though his come-up is a blur due to having it seemingly covered following his signing.

With his first release under Internet Money for “cutthroat,” Iann worked with producer Nick Mira who has produced for artists such as Juice WRLD, XXXTENTACION and Lil Skies. He has worked with artists such as Bernard Jabs and PnB Rock on his tracks “molly” and “romance361” respectively.

Iann quickly gained attention in early 2019, with him signing to TenThousand Projects in the following April. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/iann+dior">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
