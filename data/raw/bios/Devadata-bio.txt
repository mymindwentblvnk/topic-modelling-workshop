Devadata stood in mid-1997 and solid on 10 March 1998. Devadata own means of human vices, no human vices will not be perfect.
Devadata music more towards hardcore-style, old school and new school thrash metal elements.

In the era of 2000's we made the split in the form of cassette albums with band from Surabaya, Baby Dolls. 
Then while we were not full-length album out, in 2006 with the title "Emotional Breakdown" is our latest album in cassette form. 
And in the year 2009 "Emotional Breakdown" was re-released in the form of full-length CD by the label no records from Surabaya. 
Now with the new formation, we prepare to record our new album, also with new material.
