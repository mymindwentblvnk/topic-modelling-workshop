Formed in Cedar Rapids, IA, in 1996 by members Russell Binder (drums), Les Ohlhauser (guitar/vocals), Jarl Pierson (guitar), and Wade Wilson (bass). This line-up recorded one demo, "Permutation", at Schoolhouse studios in Cedar Rapids. Shortly after, they were joined by Michael Titman (keyboards). This line-up recorded one self-released effort, "Severance", in 1998 at Free Reelin' studios in Denver, CO by Ben Tanler. For a while the band played live shows, with Jarl Pierson leaving in 2000. Jarl left on very amicable terms, and is still considered a great friend of all concerned. In his place for about a year was John Pearson (Jarl rejoined for a short while but left after only one live performance with the group). John rejoined and left, and Russell Binder was replaced by Larry Unger in 2001. This group recorded the band's final album, "Suspended In Stone", at Morrisound studios in Tampa Bay, FL with Jim Morris. After the recording of the album, bassist Wade Wilson left the group, and was replaced by Carl Swanson. The group finally disbanded in 2003. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Detachment">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
