'The Red Coil project, a mix of metal, stoner, alternative, with a beer and whiskey flavour. Lots of influences (Down, Black Sabbath, Black Label Society, Kyuss, Pink Floyd, just to make few names) mixed with the idea of making rough music without frills. The name The Red Coil is related to the concept of Kundalini the energy that resides in the subtle body and it’s traditionally represented as a sleeping serpent coiled at the base of the spine The awakening of Kundalini is a kind of Dante's journey where we pass from hell to the heaven discovering heaven and hell are a mirror image and only facing its animal spirit, the man can reach liberation. The Red Coil’ sound is the soundtrack for this trip ...'
