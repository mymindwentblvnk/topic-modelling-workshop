SETH.ECTIndustrial - Death & Black Metal

Founded in 2008 by Aybars, Mert, Murat and Izmael, Seth.ECT pushes the limits of aggression and emotion through its musical symbiosis of extreme metal and industrial sounds.

Although Seth.ECT has been around for a relatively short while, it reunites some of Turkey's most experienced metal musicians. The band open up their souls on stage and the audience is always in for an energy-filled show. Seth.Ect has performed at Metalheads' Mission in Ukraine and has toured their homeland of Turkey alongside Canadians Quo Vadis.

Nowadays the guys from Seth.ECT are putting finishing touches on their first full-length album.

BE PREPARED AND STAY RESTLESS!
