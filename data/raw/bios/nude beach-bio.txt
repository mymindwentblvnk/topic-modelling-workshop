Nude Beach is a three-piece from Long Island, NY that plays power-pop / punk. They have a demo tape, and a self titled LP on Mandible Records that came out in 2010. They've toured the east and West coast, and have plans to release a 2nd Lp by the summer!

There was also another band called Nude beach from Pennsylvania that broke up.
