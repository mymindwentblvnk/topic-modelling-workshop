Started back in 2004 in Santa Ana, California as a crust/grind band by the name of Internal Disease, Goregatron's style has completely shifted and thus the new name was given. The band's lineup changed with the addition of guitarist, Lemon in 2005 and bassist Yarlz Fleshkreep later in 2008. A demo has been recorded and three of the tracks were released on the split album 3-Ways to Deprivation featuring tracks from Lord Piggy and Pigto as well.  As of 2009 the status on Goregatron is in a state of Limbo as not much has been done with the band since the release, however vocalist Mecos Mike and bassist Fleshkreep, have since become part of Erectile Dysfunction (ExD). Also guitarist FatxGrind has started a new band called Sinical Torment.
