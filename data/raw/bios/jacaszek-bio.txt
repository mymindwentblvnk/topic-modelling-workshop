In 2001 he recorded an album with songs of Miłka Malzahn, "Mapa". It was called a "trip hop sung poetry ". The album was released at 2003 (Offmusic Rec).

In 2003 a "Lem Konzept" project came to daylight. It has a form of broadcast play, but performed live with an actor reading texts of Stanisłam Lem and Jacaszek playing his music.

"Sequel" is a continuation in the line of joining together modern electronic music and "sung poetry".

The ambient masterpiece "Treny" was released in May of 2008.  Released under the Miasmah record label, it is Jacaszek's most mature record to date. By many it is believed to surpass the more recent "Pentral" - an experiment in field recording, wherein Jacaszek chose three cathedrals of Trójmiasto as sources for his samples.
