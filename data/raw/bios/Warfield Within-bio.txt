WARFIELD WITHIN from Mönchengladbach, Germany was formed in December 2005. The band consists of Sebastian Meisen (vocals), Christian Felauer (guitars), Thomas Felauer (bass), Spas (guitars) and Simon Heinen (drums).

In February 2007 the Demo “Worst Enemy” finds its way to Yonah Records who decide to cooperate with the aspiring band. A couple of months later ex Jack Slater guitarist Spas joins the band. The first album will be released on the 26th of March in 2010.

On the musical level WARFIELD WITHIN form a symbiosis between Death- and Thrash metal. Fast and aggressive drumming is combined with technical but catchy guitar riffs. The vocal spectrum ranges from deep growls to hysterical screams, thus enriching the musical variety. According to fans Warfield Within form a mixture between bands, such as Krisiun, Behemoth, Defleshed, The Haunted, Hatesphere etc, without losing their own sound.

At roughly 100 gigs in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium the band has given proof of their good reputation as an outstanding live-band. Until now they have supported bands, such as Mayhem, Sinister, Equilibrium, End of Green, Cataract, etc.

In contrast to other representatives of the genre, the lyrics have a very personal and reflective character, elaborating on themes of nihilism, pessimistic worldview and psychological illness. In this context the band’s name is to be seen literally, referring to the inner conflicts of human nature.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Warfield+Within">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
