1) Sedative is a grindcore band from Chamonix, France, formed in 2010.

2) Sedative, also known as Sedativ, was a Russian post-punk band formed by Roman Sidorov (also mastermind of Старуха Мха, Der Golem and Fatal) and his wife Alya. The music of Sedative is characterized by mid-tempo guitars, and an atmospheric, melancholic, sparse and hypnotic sound. Roman himself described his music as "psychedelic suicidal post-punk".
A first demo CD-R, simply titled "Sedative", was released in 1999. It features Evgeny Voronovsky (Cisfinitum) on synth.
A full-length album  was written and recorded sometime between 2002 and 2003, and reportedly the only copy was discovered in the wake of Roman's suicide on September 23, 2003. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sedative">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
