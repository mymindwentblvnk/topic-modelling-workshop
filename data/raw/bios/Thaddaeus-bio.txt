There are several acts with the name Thaddaeus;

1) An atmospheric funeral doom one man act from Perth, Western Australia. Formed by Theodore (a student at WAAPA studying a bachelor of music technology), and collaborated with Bartholemew Drake... Thaddaeus was created as a slow, symphonic funeral doom band expressing times of doom... However, recent developments has sent Thaddaeus into a more electronic realm, producing sounds from other, traditionally non-musical places yet still trying to express the doom that was initially intended. 

Released multiple albums and are freely downloadable from the link below.

2) A folk acoustic band from the USA. The track "alone i break" is a cover of a Korn song, done by a US acoustic artist. It is not a work of the funeral doom band from Australia. This song is off the album 'Rare Acoustic Crap'.
