Energy Of The Elements is an Italian symphonic power metal band, formed in 2008.

Their music has theatrical, orchestral, symphonic, classical and progressive inspiration, accompanied by fantasy epic and mythologic (mostly Greek and Christian) lyrics.

The band led by the Balliano brothers, Fabrizio and Riccardo (voice and guitar), created a work that shows their unconditional love for the power metal sounds from center / north Europe. Their music shows innate sense of melody with elements coming from symphonic metal that stand out while listening to the band’s debut promo entitled “Heavenly Force”.

Released in October 2009, the prelude to the full-length album entitled “Eternal Alliance” (concept album tells the epic saga of the Archangel Mikeal armed for the creation of the heavenly force against the devil) "Heavenly Force" immediately received good feedback from media (review / interview by Hard ‘n Heavy http://tinyurl.com/yjeujqy). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Energy+of+the+Elements">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
