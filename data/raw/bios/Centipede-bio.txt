There are 3 (at least) artists with the name Centipede:

1. Centipede was a jazz/progressive rock/Canterbury sound big band with more than 50 members, organized and led by the British free jazz pianist Keith Tippett, that brought together much of a generation of young British jazz and rock musicians, e.g. from the bands Soft Machine, King Crimson, Nucleus and Blossom Toes.

As well as performing some concerts (limited economically by the size of the band), they recorded one double-album, Septober Energy (produced by Robert Fripp), released in 1971.

2. Centipede is also a one-man electronic/experimental project (Shane DeYoung) with 7 releases spanning from 1996-2001.  Most of them are not formal releases on a record label.
