Hailing out of Northern Cascadia, Skagos brings forth Black Metal (in the vein of Leech and Wolves in the Throne Room). They self-released a demo in 2007, and recorded splits with Tomhet (Canada), Wake and Panopticon.
 
Skagos' first full length, titled √Åst, can be purchased through Pesanta Urfolk (vinyl). Now-discontinued editions were released through Eternal Warfare (cassette) and NHR records (CD). The band's second full-length, Anarchic, was released in 2013 through Eternal Warfare (cassette) and Flenser Records (CD). Vinyl editions of several of the band's releases and a split with Echtra remain forthcoming.

The band's name is derived from George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels, where it is the name of a northern island inhabited by a tribe of wildlings reputed to be cannibals. Several of the band's songs deal with the band's green anarchist sentiments.
