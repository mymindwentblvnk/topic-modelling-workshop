CHARING CROSS is a Swiss Heavy Metal / Hard Rock band from Lucerne. They lately gained some attention, as their song "Shout It Out" is one of the official tracks of the IIHF world championship 2009 in Switzerland.

While the history of CHARING CROSS goes back into the late eighties, the actual beginning of the band as we know them today, dates back to 1993, when Pascal Zwyssig, the longest member of the current line up, joined the group. During the following years, the history of the Swiss outfit was marked by many line-up changes. During all this time, the band played numerous concerts (club shows, festivals) with some renowned acts such as NAZARETH, SUZIE QUATTRO and SOUL SIRKUS, recorded 4 demos and one EP, until at last in 2009 the current line-up was completed. Peter Hochuli, singer and front man of CHARING CROSS, ensnares the audience with his performance and stage presence. The guitar section, consisting of Pascal Zwyssig and Andy Dormann, convinces with their powerful rhythm sound and virtuous solos. Riodi Halter (drums) and Markus Flury (bass) ensure the matching driving groove, which creates the rhythm fundament of CHARING CROSS.

„We are… CHARING CROSS“ – is the name for CHARING CROSS’ first full length album which was produced and mixed by the band itself with mastering done by Dave Ponzio (DPP Studio). Marked by a varied mix of stamping Hard Rock songs, melodious Heavy Metal tunes and one ballad, the new CD exactly represents what CHARING CROSS has been standing for through all these years.
