Grindcore band formed in the Australian town of Mt Gambier in 1996, with a line up largely unchanged since the addition of australian blast warlord Murray Ruse to the powerhouse combo of Rohan, Ben, Adrian and Annan, in 2001. Now residing in three separate states, Cleanoff has obliterated stages and festivals on all sides of Australia, from Metal for the Brain in Canberra 2003 to the massive Hellfest â€™13 in France. The last few years have also seen the 5 piece tour Europe and the US, playing Obscene Extreme, Cz  and Maryland Death Fest next to many bands about: grindcore, hardcore, metal, etc.
