Communions is a new young quartet, from the same four-wall rehearsal space as  Copenhagen contemporaries Iceage and Lower, and under the same roof as most of Copenhagen’s new punk, industrial and synth scene – at the studio and venue complex called Mayhem in Copenhagen.

Though Communions share a flame with the current Copenhagen wave, the torch is certainly their own. The four tracks that make up their debut EP entitled Cobblestones map out the aches and hopes of young hearts with remarkable precision and honesty, and is done with an unusual ear for melody and song writing.
