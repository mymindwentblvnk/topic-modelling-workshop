The Autumn League is an atmospheric death/black metal band from Sydney, Australia. Formed as a side project in 2012, the band commenced writing material for, what at the time, was to be a 5 track EP. In 2013 they released a preview track titled 'The Hour is at Hand', and months later, a second preview 'Homeward'. With a favourable response both at home and abroad, the band re-evaluated their plans for the maiden release, announcing their debut would be a full length album titled 'Concept of Irony'. If the preview tracks are anything to go by, the 'Concept of Irony' is sure to be an epic journey through an intense and atmospheric soundscape. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Autumn+League">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
