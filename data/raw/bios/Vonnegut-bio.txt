Voted Westword’s Best Modern Rock Band of 2008, and nominated again in 2009, Vonnegut has evolved considerably from it's humble beginning in late 2005. Known for energetic live shows and memorable hooks, Vonnegut celebrated the release of its debut E.P. “Fall into Place” with a sold out show, local radio play, and a couple regional tours. Vonnegut has had the opportunity to share the stage with artists such as Paper Route, Great Northern, Jeremy Enigk, VAST, Stars of Track and Field, Oh No Not Stereo, The Royal Heist and What Made Milwaukee Famous to name a few. Vonnegut is currently in the studio recording a brand new album slated for an June 2010 release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vonnegut">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
