From the catacombs of Vrondor’s revelations, Thronum Vrondor witnessed its first burning dawn in October 2005. The concept of “Vrondor I: Epitaph of Mass Destruction” was lyrically accomplished during this time and before the end of 2005, five hymns were created to reinforce the grim deathlike atmosphere. Drummer Crygh and Vrondor intensively rehearsed these demonic chants in order to release this masterpiece of horrifying glory.

In April 2006 the first album “Vrondor I: Epitaph of Mass Destruction” was recorded and Thronum Vrondor was ready to befoul mankind with this opus of misery and despair; a true masterpiece that will guide you to the darkest and eminent black metal regions of old.
