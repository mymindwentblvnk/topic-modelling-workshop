Sunglasses Kid is a British music producer who takes you out of the daily grind and into a world of pure nostalgia. His music is a mix of vocal driven pop and romantic electronic instrumentals, influenced by the music, movies, and fashion of the late 80s and early 90s.

Sunglasses Kid's music is known for being 'more 80s than the 80s', with his tracks often being fun, up-beat pop that definitely don't need any more cowbell.

His music has been featured on commercials, and his live shows attract a fun mix of break-dancers, cos-players and 80s movie fans. He has played at Amsterdam Dance Event alongside artists College and Timecop 1983, and has co-written tracks with synthwave artist Nina. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sunglasses+Kid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
