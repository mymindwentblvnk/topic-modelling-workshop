1) Aspid is a Mexican heavy metal band, formed in 1984.

2) Russia's Аспид, formed in 1988, were only together as a band for a few short years, recording their fantastic debut full-length (entitled 'Кровоизлияние' (or 'Krovoizliianie'), meaning 'Extravasation' in English) in 1992 at a prestigious studio. All the ingredients were there for a very successful career: Musicianship, production, vision, and songwriting as impressive as the abilities of its creators. Unfortunately, the album was released in very small numbers on vinyl, and later, tape, meanwhile Аспид disbanded, resulting in the album and band vanishing from the radar before having a chance to leave a mark.

The band reunited in 2012 and released a new song for the compilation album Monsters of Rock USSR: XX Years Later. Кровоизлияние has been reissued twice, in 2007 and then again in 2014. The 2007 version included English song titles and had a slightly sped-up sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aspid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
