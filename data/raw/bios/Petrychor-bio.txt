Petrychor is an atmospheric black metal project from USA, formed in 2009, and containing elements of folk, world, classical and noise music. A debut EP, Dryad, was released unceremoniously in February of 2010 and quickly gained a following on the internet through numerous reviews, filesharing, and radio play. In May of 2011, a full-length album, Effigies and Epitaphs, was released digitally with a physical release on Khrysanthoney following sometime thereafter. The 2CD set contains both releases in double-sided packaging, and is currently available for purchase through Aquarius Records.

In 2013, a split with Frozen Ocean entitled Autumn Bridges was released on Wolfsgrimm Records. The full-length album Makrokosmos followed in 2014. The 26-minute Apocalyptic Witchcraft was released as a single-track EP on Samhain 2015. Makrokosmos and Apocalyptic Witchcraft have since been released on CD together through Wolfspell Records.
