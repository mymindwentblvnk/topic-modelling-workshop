The male/female duo, I Break Horses, are the nom de plume of Maria Lind√©n and her musical partner Fredrik Balck. The pair named themselves after a Smog song.

Residing in Stockholm, Sweden, the duo quietly crafted the nine tracks that make up 2011's debut album Hearts throughout stolen moments gathered up since their formation in 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/I+Break+Horses">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
