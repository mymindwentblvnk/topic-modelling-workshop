German Death Metal Devastation

Hailing from the deepest south of Germany, this fourpiece stands for the perfect unity of uncompromisingly punishing blast attacks with neck-breaking mid-tempo banging groove and massive shredding sound-walls. L’ESTARD thus avoids being tainted by hyped modern metal traits and Core-elements.
Pure crushing Death Metal – That’s the banner of L’ESTARD!

Two years after the formation of the band and some line-up changes the TANKSAFE STUDIOS were entered and the first Album entitled "Baptized in Blood" was forged, which was released in Mai 2005.

The shows in 2005 and 2006 got L’ESTARD a monster recognition in southern Germany and Austria. The following two years bore witness to new killer songs and massive live devastation! Over 50 gigs in southern Germany and Austria were played, sharing the stages with bands like Nile, Belphegor, Six Feet Under, Fintroll, Sworn Enemy and many many more!

Backed up by a growing arsenal of devastating songs, L’ESTARD wreaked havoc on their way. The audiences’ reaction proved the band to be on the right way! 
In December 2007 the band entered the CHAINSAW SOLUTIONS STUDIOS to record their second album entitled "DRIVEN INTO SLAUGHTER" 

The album got good reactions all over Europe and further enhanced the band’s status in the Underground. 

Since the beginning of 2008, the line-up has changed once more and the band instantly continued to work on new songs.
