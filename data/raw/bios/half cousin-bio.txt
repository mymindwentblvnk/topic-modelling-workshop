Half Cousin are from The Orkney Islands, off the north-eastern tip of Scotland.
Their debut album "The Function Room" appeared in 2004 and was inspired by the islands' weather-beaten landscapes and off-beat characters. Sought after singles "Half Turn/Mrs Pilling", "Country Cassette" and "The Diary Fire EP" paved the way for acclaimed shows supporting the likes of Hot Chip, The Earlies and Boom Bip. A collaboration with Hans-Joachim Roedelius and contributions to the Blank Tape Spillage Fete cemented Half Cousin's reputation as something fresh and exciting. Main songwriter Kevin Cormack has teamed up with old Orcadian school friend Jimmy Hogarth to record "Iodine" - the follow up to "The Function Room". As before junk percussion, cheap electronics and family heirlooms prevail - but the results are far more beguiling, detailed and, at times, euphoric. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Half+Cousin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
