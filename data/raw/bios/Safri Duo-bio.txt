After being signed, a track mixing both tribal sound and modern electronica was set to be released in 2000 The result was the tremendously popular "Played-a-live (The Bongo Song)," that became one of the most popular songs in Europe that year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Safri+Duo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
