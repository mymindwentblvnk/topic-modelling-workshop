Malignant Inception is a progressive black/death metal band from Salt Lake City, UT. They were formed in 1992 by Ed Price and Chad Kasimatis with the intention of playing brutal death metal in the vein of Suffocation and Malevolent Creation. They made one album in this style, "Black Death", but have currently taken on much more influence from black metal and progressive metal. Their newest album "Path to Repression" showcases these influences, and their newer material seems to push even further into black metal territory.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malignant+Inception">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
