P.P.P. is an independent, all-female Heavy Metal unit founded in 2004 in Japan. The two members are Eto (guitars and bass) and Tane (vocals and keyboards). 

Their sound is rooted in fast and melodic Heavy Metal. The band name is said to be chosen because it resembles an upside-down version of '666'. They list their influences as Iron Maiden, Heavens Gate, Grim Reaper and Yngwie Malmsteen.

So far they have two self-published albums, Under Tombstone from 2005 and Made in Death Island from 2006. The band gives away all their album tracks and more unreleased tracks via their web site.
