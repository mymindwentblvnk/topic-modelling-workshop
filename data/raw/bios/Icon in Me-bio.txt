The Russian-European project ICON IN ME's history took its rise in August 2007.
After the Moscow band Hostile Breed's activity stopped, its inspirer the guitarist D.Frans had the idea to launch a new, longed-for international project. Within two months the band membership both from Russia and Europe was settled. At the start of November, the band began recording their debut fullsize album recorded under the authority of the widely-recognized producer Jacob Hansen (Destruction, Mercenary, Raunchy etc.) in the Danish studio Hansen records.

During six months of working in many various studios within Europe and Russia, the work on the album was in a full swing. To help work on this album, many guest musicians were invited, including Steve Smyth (ex. Nevermore, Testament), Flemming C.Lund (The Arcane Order, Invocator) and Andy Solvestrom (Within Y, Evildoer, Cipher System). Eventually the album returned to Jacob Hansen to be edited.

In early July 2008 ICON IN ME played their first show with original material opening the Moscow show of the legendary Machine Head. After the perfomance, fans realise that ICON IN ME was the last hope for the Russian Metal genre. At the same time, the video for their first single was being shot,  "That Day, That Sorrow".

Currently, the members of ICON IN ME are preparing for live shows while looking for a contract, which will enable their albums to be released all over the World.
