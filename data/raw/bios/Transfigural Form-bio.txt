Transfigural Form rose from the ashes of Eden in Ruins in late 2000.  Todd Pope was the one man behind all the music.  He recorded two full CD's and three Eps under the name Transfigural Form between 2001 and 2003.  Transfigural Form was introduced into the Christian metal scene with its mixing of thrash metal with death and black metal.  Todd debuted with his first album State of Decay in 2001 with its death and black influences and followed up with his very keyboard heavy Refusal album in 2002.  Proclaiming a very bold faith in Jesus Christ, Transfigural Form was destined for success within Christian metal, or was it?  Around the end of 2003 Todd's faith began to waiver and he fell away from Christ and the Christian community all the way until his birthday in 2004 when he rededicated his life to Jesus Christ.
