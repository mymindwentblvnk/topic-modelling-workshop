Hailing from NJ, Fight Amp have been chugging along for over 9 years spreading their own brand of genre-bending punk/noise-rock throughout the country and world. Having built a cult following throughout the underground, they have continued to tour and play to both small and large crowds coast to coast as headliners and as support for larger touring bands. Having released three full lengths and countless splits and EPs, Fight Amp has defined itself as one of the seminal current underground bands that blends multiple heavy genres and can exist in the underground while still appealing to audiences across the board of punk and metal. Much of what Fight Amp does calls on punk, hardcore, metal and rock sounds from the 70s, 80s, 90s and 00s while spinning it all into a sound that is their own and not dated or retro.
