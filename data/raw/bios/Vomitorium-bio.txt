1) Vomitorium is an performance art/improvised music collective based in Hialeah,FL. The collective was formed by all of the employees at "Substantials" ,a sandwich shop in Miami Lakes,FL, in early 2006. Since then they have added anyone interested to their line up which is ever changing. They don't consider themselves to be a band due to the fact that they don't rehearse, don't write songs, don't have a line up, are not comprised of musicians exclusively, or actually need to appear at their performances. 
"Hialeah is a bunch of kids from Hialeah making music together that is not always together".
