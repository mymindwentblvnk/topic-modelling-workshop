The Kolios Project was started in 2002 by guitarist and composer Ryan Denzer-King (ex-Vailala Madness). Frustrated by the lack of like-minded musicians at his university, he instead turned to internet forums to find other people with personal recording capabilities who were interested in his kind of music. Soon after the start of the project, Ryan found Manfred Dikkers (At War with Self, ATM Project), a capable jazz drummer with a set of V-drums and an interest in progressive music. Ryan and Manfred recorded the first two songs in the latter part of 2002, still looking for other musicians to join them. During this period Alan Goldstein (Aghora) recorded several tracks with them, but later dropped out due to his busy schedule. During 2003 keyboardist Matteo Borselli (Anthelion) recorded two tracks, but eventually had to dedicate himself solely to Anthelion. After lacking a full-time bassist since Alan's departure (during which time bassist Jan-Mikael Erakare contributed to one track, and Ryan recorded bass for another), the band finally found bassist Pablo Carrascosa (Tekne). Pablo's improvisatory style fit in well with the technical and experimental side of The Kolios Project. Joining in on one track for guest solos are Tymon Kruidenier (Exivious) and guitarist Andre Verholen. More recently, Santiago Dobles (Aghora) contributed a solo to the final song on the 2005 demo. Currently the band is working on their first full-length album, slated for release later this year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Kolios+Project">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
