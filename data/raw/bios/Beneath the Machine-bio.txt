From it's humble beginnings as three metal heads attending Northern Essex Community College, Beneath the Machine has always been about being the heaviest, most abrasive sounding metal band rising above the overwhelming abundance of hardcore bands that dominate the area. The catalyst for this band was the introduction of guitarist Vilhelm Inferno to an established act founded by vocalist Dionysus and pianist/violinist James Nightmare, The three started the group from the ground up and eventually tried out friend bassist Allen Zero, the last member to be added was drummer Joey Dead after former drummer Michael Ferrick decided to leave after a few months. Musical influences range from Death metal and Black metal, through onto various alternative styles of hard rock music. Lyrical focus is on concepts such as zombies, serial killers, and viking mythology to name a few.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beneath+The+Machine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
