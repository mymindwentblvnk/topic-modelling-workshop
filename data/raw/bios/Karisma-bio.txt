Very obscure is this band and LP. In 1983 they managed to release this independent album and played simple but good NWOBHM-ish metal. The lyrics are in English, which was very unusual at this time. Maybe guitar player Helmut Fritz and his crew had international ambitions. Sadly, after this LP (with a primitive painted walrus cover) they disappeared, and not more information could be found. The LP is hard to find. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Karisma">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
