Battle of Mice was a sludge / post-rock band founded in 2005 in New York, NY, United States. Formed by members of Neurot Recordings' label mates Red Sparowes and Made Out of Babies, Battle of Mice delivered a crushing heaviness you might expect, but at the same time created stunningly beautiful moments of lush guitars and elegant vocals, powered by slow, methodic drumming.

Battle of Mice was comprised of Julie Christmas (Made Out of Babies) on vocals; Josh Graham (Neurosis visuals, Red Sparowes, A Storm of Light) on guitars/keyboards; Tony Maimone on bass (The Book of Knots and previously of Pere Ubu) and Joel Hamilton on drums (who has worked with Sparklehorse, Unsane, Frank Black, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits and more).

They debuted with the 3-way split EP "Triad", shared with Red Sparowes and Made Out of Babies. In 2006 their first full-length album "A Day of Nights" was released on Neurot Recordings. Their last release, a split EP with Jesu, was released in 2008.

On September 3rd, 2009, a blog was posted on the band's Myspace page stating that the band was parting ways.
