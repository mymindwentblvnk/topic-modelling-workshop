Chlöe Howl (pronounced as standard klo-ee) is a British singer/songwriter. 

Born March 4th, 1995 as Chlöe Howells, she grew up in the small village of Holyport. As a child, she became interested in music through hip-hop mix CDs and artists like Alicia Keys. Howl left school at age 16, and signed a deal with Columbia Records shortly thereafter. 

In March 2013, she released her first EP, Rumour for free on Soundcloud, followed over the year by No Strings and Paper Heart. In March 2014, those titular songs were consolidated into one EP called Rumour EP. Working with Eg White to produce her debut album, she says that "all my songs are about being a bored teenager, 'cos I am one".

In 2014, she was nominated for the BBC Sound of 2014 and a BRIT Award for Critic's Choice.
