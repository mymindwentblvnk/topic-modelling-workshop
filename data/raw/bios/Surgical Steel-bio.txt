Surgical Steel were an LA based metal band in the mid 80s who achieved some success on the live gig circuit and befriended Rob Halford. They are perhaps best known as a former band of Jeff Martin (most notably of Racer X), whom recommended Racer X band-mate Scott Travis to Judas Priest when they were searching for a new drummer circa 1989. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Surgical+Steel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
