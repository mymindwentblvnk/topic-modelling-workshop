Pushing the boundaries of bass music with a sinister yet poignant sound is Parisian producer Fytch. With organic elements melded with tactful distortions, Fytch’s signature style continues to evolve to a more emotionally driven sound. Organic, Subliminal and Visceral are three words that illustrate Fytch’s philosophy and approach to production.
