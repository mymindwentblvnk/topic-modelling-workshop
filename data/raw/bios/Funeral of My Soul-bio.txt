Funeral Doom project from Trist (Trist, Life is Pain, ex Deep-Pression). The project was created only for a split album with "Mistress of the Dead", another Funeral Doom project from the Czech Republic. This release, called "Funeral Within Us", is limited to 100 handnumbered copies and comes on CD-R in an A5-DVD box. Both bands contributed one song to this split.

Trist has ended this project.
