The name of the band is the best calling card for these six angry metal heads. Carving the emotions of their audience with the most violent performance they could possibly deliver is, as a matter of fact, their most notable trait. The band made an impact with their 2010 three tracks EP, which was reviewed enthusiastically by many international extreme metal zines and attracted the interest of legendary black/thrashers Necrodeath, who consequently decided to take them on their 25th Anniversary European tour. Gigs with many others notable acts followed (Necrodeath, Schizo, Vexed, Bejelit, Mastercastle, Death Mechanism, Destrage, Doomraiser, GhostRider, Story of Jade.), cementing the band’s reputation and leading them to some new musical ideas for their debut full length release, ‘Dies Irae’, which was finally completed at the beginning of 2013.
Recorded and mixed in Italy and mastered at Chartmakers Studio (Rammstein, Volbeat, Apocalyptica), Finland, ‘Dies Irae’ mixes powerful guitar riffs, massive grooves and brutal vocals with beautiful melodies and refined classical passages. 
Dies Irae will be released on Bakerteam Records on March 26th, 2013 and will be followed by an intense live activity, including an European tour in April.
