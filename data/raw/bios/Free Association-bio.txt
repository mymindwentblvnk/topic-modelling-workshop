Cosmic / Balearic sounding club jams from Alister Johnson (AKA DJ Catalist) and Andrew Allsgood (History Clock, Rvng). The 12" kicks off with "Love Affair", an epic psychedelic club groover featuring a seriously funky bassline, dubbed-out clavinet, strings and big horns. Wow! Next up we get "River Stixx", a minimal percussive / tribal cut that worms its way round your hips. Flip it for "Goodie Goodie", a darker piece of electronic  disco with a serious swagger. Lastly we go upbeat with disco rocker "Live Sweaters". Essential for fans of History Clock, "Originals", Psychemagik etc. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Free+Association">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
