Severe Outburst biography.

After the split-up of three befriended bands, some members of Burning Soul (Melodic Metal with swedish influences), Depredation (Catchy old-school death metal) and Casual Victims (Hardcore) deceided to start a new band. In July 2005 Severe Outburst was founded from leftovers of these three bands. Because of the different backgrounds of the bandmembers a recognisable sound was easily created. Contagious drum anthems, supported by tight pumping guitar & bass riffs form a good base for great catchy metal songs, which vary from slow to insane. 

Severe Outburst is:
Arjan van Breugel - Vocals
Maikel Timmermans - Drums
Maurice van Dijck - Lead and Solo Guitars
Paul Berndsen - Lead Guitars
Roel van den Brand - Bass and Backing Vocals
