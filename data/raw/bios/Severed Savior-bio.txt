Severed Savior are a technical brutal death metal band from San Francisco, California. They formed in 1999 by Troy Fullerton (Drums, also in Carnivorous (US)). They play extremely technical brutal death metal with ripping guitars, harsh vocals and blasting technical drumming.

The band released their "Forced to Bleed" EP in 2001, which was widely acclaimed by underground magazines. This showed their grandiose technical skill on their instruments and progression for a label contract.

They got that contract with underground specialists Unique Leader Records and released their debut full-length album "Brutality is Law" which increased the progressive brutality and technicality of the band. They later released a one-song demo in 2006.

Their second full-length entitled "Servile Insurrection" was released through Willowtip records.
