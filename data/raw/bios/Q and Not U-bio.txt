Q and Not U was a Washington, D.C. post-hardcore band from 1998-2005, signed with Dischord Records. Their sound, with fractured guitar leads and disorganized and inventive percussion, was a direct tribute to DC post-hardcore forefathers like Fugazi and Rites of Spring, but added noticably more art-damaged and rhythmic elements to their chaotic and emotional music. Members John Davis, Harris Klahr, Christopher Richards, and Matt Borlik formed the band in 1998. After Borlik's departure following the release of their first album, the band went on to record two more critically lauded LPs as a three-piece, exploring aspects of post-hardcore, dance-punk, and other disparate musical styles. Q and Not U disbanded in September 2005 after completing their touring commitments and a short farewell stand in Washington, D.C. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Q+and+Not+U">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
