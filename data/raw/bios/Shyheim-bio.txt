Shyheim is a rapper from Staten Island, and is a member of the Wu-Tang Killa Beez. He shot straight onto the scene with his debut Single On & On in 1993. A year later, only 14 years of age, he released his debut album, AKA The Rugged Child. Lyrically, he impressed rappers with a skill level that would make any hip-hop fan forget about his age altogether. As a native of Staten Island, NY, Shyheim even spent time living with Wu-Tang member Ghostface Killah. Shyheim released his second LP, The Lost Generation, in 1996. The acclaimed Manchild followed in 1999.
