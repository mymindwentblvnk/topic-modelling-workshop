Hayden Calnin is an Australian singer-songwriter based in Melbourne.

The ink lines that would shape young, self-produced, singer/songwriter Hayden Calnin and his budding musical career were drawn in his teen years after his father gave him a guitar at age 14. He hasnâ€™t gone a day since without playing it.
Dabbling in bands through his teen years led him to add drums and piano to his repertoire, until at the age of 17 he finally decided to give singing a go. 

Calnin's guitar-driven sound is complemented by a selection of husky, honest harmonies and delicate folk-pop melodies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hayden+Calnin">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
