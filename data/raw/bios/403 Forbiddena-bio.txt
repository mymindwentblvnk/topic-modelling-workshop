403
403 Forbiddena is a J-Rock band that sings completely in English and appear to be heavily influenced by the power metal genre. The "403" part of their name refers to the radio station their music is regularly played on, while Forbiddena is the name of the group. It's also a play off the common "403 Forbidden" message displayed in internet browsers. Originally a small-time band composed of university students, they became quite popular as a local indie band.

The band reached internet fame because of the Japanese Flash movie Nightmare City  (and variation, 4chan City) and it's sequel, Nightmare City Catastrophe. Mostly because of Nightmare City, Southern Cross is their most downloaded song.

Several of their songs are titled after heavenly bodies and effects such as the Northern Lights, Polar Star(North Star), and the Southern Cross.

The band has a CD scheduled to be released in August 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/403+Forbiddena">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
