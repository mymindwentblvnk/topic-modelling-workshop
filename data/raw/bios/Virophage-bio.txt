Unknowable malice that lurks within the cracks of the cosmos… the void-black reaches of the starless abyss… devastation wrought upon a species devoid of worth… redemption through pain and destruction and utter annihilation… grinding the foundations of feeble belief systems into dust… thus the ways of Virophage are born. Havenless and The Watcher united at the commencement of anno MMX to render their message through sonic violence – searing, bleak black metal, a vortex of aggression, hatred and despair.

MMXI has seen the completion of the four-song ‘Endpoint’ EP. With the addition of Gno to our cause, our line up is complete so work will begin on a follow-up full-length album and live dates will commence in the Autumn.
