The Saints are a punk-rock band formed in 1974 in Brisbane, Australia. Their musical inspiration came from sources as diverse as 1950s rock 'n' roll and 1960s Detroit punk band The Stooges. The Saints music pioneered the fast tempos and buzzing guitars parallel to more widely-known punk acts like The Ramones and the Sex Pistols.

In mid-1977 the band moved to the UK, where it became apparent that they and their label had different ideas as to how they should be marketed. EMI planned to sell The Saints as a typical punk band complete with ripped clothes. The Saints insisted on wearing collared shirts and sweaters, and left their hair long. The original line-up consisted of vocalist Chris Bailey, guitarist Ed Kuepper and Ivor Hay on drums with Kym Bradshaw and later Algy Ward on bass.

Kuepper, Hay and Ward left the band in 1978, but Chris Bailey continued touring and recording as The Saints with a revolving line-up of musicians throughout the 80's including the late Janine Hall on bass. The Saints' commercial breakthrough into the US came in 1986 with the album "All Fools Day", with the video for "Just Like Fire Would" receiving airplay on MTV. 

After releasing a couple of records under his own name, Bailey reformed The Saints in 1996. Once again without any of the other founding members but they have reunited occasionally to perform live. The Saints music could often be heard in the background during episodes of Neighbours in the 1990's!

Chris Bailey - Guitar and vocals
Caspar Wijnberg - Bass
Peter Wilkinson - Drums
