Mediaskare Records is proud to announce the signing of Phoenix, AZ based band REDEEMER. Formed in 2009, REDEEMER started as the means for its members to express their passion for hardcore music and share the everlasting love of Jesus Christ to a music scene where “God Free” is becoming a trend. “We want people to know that there is hope,” commented the band. “We've all had bad experiences within churches and felt betrayed, but it's important that we not blame God or turn from His love because of this.”

For further insight on their music, the band offered the following “We write songs about struggle and about pain because we all know about that. Our relationship with Jesus Christ is our focus, not religion or the dividing walls of a hierarchy. We have to come back to the heart of worship. Our songs are written mostly about things that we've all struggled with individually or as a whole such as our own pride, our struggle at times to keep praising through the storm, struggles with being hurt by church communities, and spiritual battles that have torn all of us apart in our own respect.”

When it came time to choosing a label to release their debut album, the band decided on Mediaskare Records, stating “Mediaskare's roster is full of amazing bands that we'd love to be able to associate ourselves with in the future.”

The band will enter the studio to begin recording their debut full-length album this fall, in the meantime you can check out tracks from the band’s self-released EP on their official Facebook page located at http://www.facebook.com/redeemerhc <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Redeemer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
