Major Capture were originally an one-man-band from Uusikaupunki, Finland, which played death/thrash, and was founded in the beginning of 2006. The project had no name when the first versions of "Ikuinen talvi" and "Betrayed" were made. But in the summer of 2006, the band had finally name, "Death Groove".

As Death Groove, they released one demo in Mikseri.net,
called "This Bullet In Your Skull...".
It contained 4 songs.

In the beginning of 2007, Jarno gave up with the project. But then he started to have new ideas.

In the summer 2007 Jarno changed the name of the project to "Major Capture". He also started to create a line-up.

In autumn 2007, few sessions with a real band were held. But soon all had to split-up because lack of time.

Major Capture was now again a one-man-band.

In the beginning of February, first demo (actually democompilation) were finally released.

The first track "Welcome To The Garden of Hate" were the most downloaded from Major Capture.

There have been many members included so far, but Major Capture is still an one-man band. In the summer 2008, Major Capture had second demo out, called "Deep Inside".
It was also a success, and many thought that it was better than the first demo.

In the autumn 2008, "Kill" had been released. Jarno thinks, that the demo sounds like Major Capture, for real. This is the sound, that he had been looking for two years. 

In the beginning of 2009, when the 4th demo "The Revelation" was released, Jarno was thinking that it wasn't as good as "Kill". So Jarno started to think that it'd be better to end it now.

In 2011 Jarno decided to record again the songs from "Garden of Hate", since it has been 5 years from the first notes of Major Capture. Some previously unreleased songs were included. It was released in 2012.

Maybe for the last time, in the end of 2012, Jarno decided to do a one more release since he had some new "Major Capture" -style songs up his sleeve. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Major+Capture">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
