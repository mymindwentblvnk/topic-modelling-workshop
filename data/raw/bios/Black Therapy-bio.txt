Black Therapy was formed in Rome in 2009. After a first demo tape (Through This Path) they publicized three studio albums. The style of music is somewhat like the well known Scandinavian Melodic Death Metal. Currently they are signed by Black Lion Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Therapy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
