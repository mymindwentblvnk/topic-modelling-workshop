Bryce Dessner (b. 1976 in Cincinnati, Ohio) is one of the guitarists of The National. He is also one of the most sought-after composers of his generation, with a rapidly expanding catalog of works commissioned by leading ensembles and organisations, including the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Kronos Quartet, BAM Next Wave Festival, Barbican Centre, Edinburgh International Festival, Sydney Festival, BBC Symphony Orchestra, eighth blackbird, Sō Percussion, New York City Ballet, and many others.

After early training on the flute, Dessner switched to classical guitar and then composition. He earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Yale University. In the late 90's, he formed the instrumental quartet Clogs, and in 2001, co-founded the acclaimed indie-rock band The National. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bryce+Dessner">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
