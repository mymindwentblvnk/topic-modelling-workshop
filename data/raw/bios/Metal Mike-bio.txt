Mike Saunders (born May 1952), better known as "Metal Mike" Saunders, is a rock critic and the singer of the Californian punk band Angry Samoans. He is credited with coining the music genre label "heavy metal" in a record review for Humble Pie's As Safe As Yesterday Is in the November 12, 1970 issue of Rolling Stone. (The original text is shown in the VH1 Classic documentary Heavy: The Story of Metal [1] from 2007). Six months later, he used the phrase again while reviewing Sir Lord Baltimore's first album, Kingdom Come, in the pages of Creem magazine in 1971. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Metal+Mike">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
