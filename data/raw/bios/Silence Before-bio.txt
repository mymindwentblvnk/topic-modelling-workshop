Silence Before (SB) is a 5-piece hardcore/metal band from Maribor, Slovenia. The band originally started up in year 2009 as a 4-piece band. SB represents a mixture of hardcore and metal. From blast beats and heavy riffing to powerful breakdowns with intense moments...this is Silence Before.

It's all about having fun, playing instruments, playing gigs, smiling, moshing, fucking ripping your head off, enjoying life, enjoying extreme awesome music, being yourself and having the time off your life...

There are only two originally members of the band. Mitja (guitar) and Miha (drums) were playing together as little kids. They wanted to have a band with melodic sound and powerful riffing. Soon David (vocals) came, who later became a very good friend and companion. They were looking for a bass player and they thought of Črtomir (bass), who later also became a very good friend and colleague. The band was ready to attack. Mitja and David started to write songs and lyrics. After a few shows the band found out they need another guitar player, so Davor (guitar) came along. Davor is a great guitar player and a trustworthy person. 

Current line-up:

David Valh - Vocals
Mitja Levašič - Guitars
Davor Krueger - Guitars
Črtomir Lorenčič - Bass Guitar
Miha Vučko - Drums
