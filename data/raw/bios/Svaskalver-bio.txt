Svaskalver is a new folk-metal band from Saint Petersburg, Russia formed in 2012. The musicians enjoy combining original neofolk motives with a variety of modern metal riffs and strong female vocals into a distinctive melodic sound. The music is influenced to a certain extent by some of the iconic European metal bands including In Flames, Eluveitie, Before the Dawn, Korpiklaani and Nightwish. Most of the songs are inspired by ancient mythology of Northern Europe, fantasy literature and other corresponding themes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Svaskalver">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
