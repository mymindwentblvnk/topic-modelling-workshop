Influenced by modern Metal - from melodic to death - as well as early synth pioneers like Jean-Michel Jarre, voXager is an attempt at putting music to the words of the sci-fi novel "Farnham's Legend".

Beyond The Heliosheath, the in-production album, tells the epic story of a voYage far beyond our sun, a story of friendship, love, wartime, and also of great bravery where none was expected.
