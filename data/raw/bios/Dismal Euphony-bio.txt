In 1992 Ole K. Helgesen and Kristoffer Austrheim formed a death-metal band called "The Headless Children". Through various member and band name changes the so called "Dismal Euphony" (depressing melody) was born around 1994, and their first demo Spellbound was released is 1995, followed by a self-titled single in 1996. 

During the next two years, Dismal Euphony released two full-length albums, Soria Moria Slott and Autumn Leaves - The Rebellion of Tides. The latter included the song Splendid Horror, which is more industrial-like, as well as a 'hidden' part at the end of that track.
In 1998, both vocalist Linn Achre Tveit and keyboardist Elin Overskott (who died of an heroin overdose in 2004) left the band. They were replaced by Anja Natasha (vocals) and Svenn-Aksel Henriksen (keyboards). 

With the new line-up, the band recorderd and released the album All Little Devils and the EP Lady Ablaze. Dismal Euphony's last full-length Python Zero saw the light of day in 2001. After that, the band split up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dismal+Euphony">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
