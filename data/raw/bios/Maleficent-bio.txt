Maleficent is an alternative band from London, U.K. Formed in 2006 by Maleficent Martini, the beautiful lead vocalist and Mortimer Cain, singer, the band got to the present outfit when Vincent M. Sickx joined, taking care of the music production. The music ranges from upbeat synth driven industrial to progressive metal, going through sleazy R’n’R and dirty soundscapes, with antagonizing double vocals, creating a very unique contraposition between beauty and evil. 
The debut Cd Demize was self released in January 2009. Not to be mistaken with the metal band with the same name from Texas, U.S. (The record listed "Bleedover", is not from Maleficent UK)
