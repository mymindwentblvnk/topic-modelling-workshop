"Snake Oil was formed in June of 2012 when Juho and Ville started looking people to join their band and Timo was found through Muusikoiden.net and he was asked to join the band to play drums. A meeting was scheduled with the new drummer and by accident they also met Eemeli who was with Timo at the meeting. After two months of rehearsing Timo and Juho switched instruments. The band rehearsed without a bassist until January 2013 when Antti joined the band to take place as the bass player."
