The band played mostly in the Texas and California area, sharing the same stages acts such as Pantera, Helstar, Vicious Rumors, Lizzy Borden, Doro, D’Priest, Leatherwolf, Biohazard, Anihilator and Coroner, among others. Decadence’s music was regularly played on Z-Rock, the defunct national metal radio network which was very popular in the late 80’s and early 90’s. Decadence’s sound was classified somewhere between Metallica and Iron Maiden, with some hints of early progressive metal acts such as Fates Warning. Many demos were recorded, including a recording of a show in LA’s the Roxy Club while the band were invited to showcase for major labels Sony Music, Hollywood Records and Universal. The band disbanded in 1993. Dennis went on to work in the music industry, with artists such as Shakira and being nominated for 3 Latin Grammy’s as executive producer and engineering. Diego, a physicist, never left music aside either, accumulating an enviable guitar and amp collection.
