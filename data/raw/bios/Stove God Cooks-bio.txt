Syracuse-bred rapper Stove God Cooks is among the leading voices of hip-hop’s gritty, lyrically-inclined resurgence, earning him critical and fan acclaim. Ushering in the next chapter of his career, Cooks has recently announced signing with the New York-based independent label, Babygrande Records.
 
Stove God Cooks has become a fixture on respected tastemakers’ radars. Having earned a feature on Westside Gunn’s 2019 Flygod Is An Awesome God 2 project, Cooks’ allure in this modern-nostalgic sound was further realized upon collaborating with Roc Marciano on their standout album, Reasonable Drought. The joint effort has received unanimous praise, landing a spot on Complex’s coveted 2020 year-end best albums list. Cooks was also named one of Billboard’s top-15 2021 Hip-Hop and R&B artists-to-watch.
 
After his successful collaboration with French Montana on his first single of this year, “Dope,” the Babygrande artist has returned with his latest track and video, “That’s The Game,” which premiered on HipHopDX. Cooks shows that he won’t be confined to one style; rather, he’s experimenting sonically and embarks on a new journey with “That’s The Game.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stove+God+Cooks">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
