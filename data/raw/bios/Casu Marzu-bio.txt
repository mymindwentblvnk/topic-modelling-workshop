Hailing from Madison, Wisconsin and taking their namesake from the most metal of all cheeses  (which notably contains maggots), Casu Marzu uses progressive elements to push the limits of Black Metal and Death Metal in an attempt to cultivate atmospheric soundscapes that blast into monolithic rhythms. Each song is designed to tell a story, drawing on creative influences from the poetry of word smith Alexander Monday.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Casu+Marzu">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
