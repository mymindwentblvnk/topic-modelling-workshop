Second Impact is a metalcore band from Echt, a small town in Limburg, the Netherlands. Limburg already has as rich history of hardcore bands, like Born from Pain and Backfire. Second Impact was founded at the summer of 2006, when four young people decided to join forces to blow everyone’s ears off with their music. They met each other at local festivals and concerts where bands as Born from Pain played. This is where it began. After becoming close friends, they decided to go to concerts from bands like As I Lay Dying and Hatebreed together. They felt heavily inspired by that music and by bands like Trivium, Caliban, Killswitch Engage and Neaera, but they decided to do it a little bit different. The four friends already played in other bands, but when they came together as Second Impact, they knew this was what they were all waiting for. That’s why they decided to call their band Second Impact. It means that this is their second adventure in the big world of music and that they’re ready to leave behind an enormous impact on the metalcore scene. With burning lead guitar parts from Sjir Schoenmakers which’ll engulf you in flames, heavy rhythmic parts by Boy Claessen you’ll become addicted to, thumping bass lines from Koen Vaessen which’ll change the whole crowd into one big moshpit and earth splitting drum riffs by Timo Stevens (they even needed to reinforce the walls because of him), they started to create their own music. But what about the vocals? After a short while tormenting their own throats, they discovered the unrefined voice of Patrick Göbbels, a inspiring musician from Landgraaf. With him joining the band their dream was finally reality. Since then the musical performances improved a lot. The ingredients named above mixed with talent and originality formed a unique sound. This sound was used to write their own songs, and now they’ve completed a whole set list. So it’s obvious that this band is ready to take on whatever crosses their path.
