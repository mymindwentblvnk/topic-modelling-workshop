Crack Up are a metal band from Huenxe, Germany. Their earlier albums, such as "From The Ground", place the band's style mostly in the death metal camp, although with a more midpaced power metal tempo rather than the faster old-school death style. On later material, the band have introduced a "death rock" or "death 'n' roll" style - a mixture cocktail of "Entombed meets Turbonegro" (recorded by Andy Claasen of Holy Moses), a genre similar to Entombed, or Swansong by Carcass.

The band announced their breakup in November 2003, stating that their musical progression had come to an end. As goodbye gift for all fans they've released a vinyl special split together with the High- Speed- Grind- Punk- Death- Metal band The Now Noise! on their buddy label Wanker Records.

Crack Up haved support many european tours together with Death, Benediction, Dismember, Pro-Pain or Unleashed.
