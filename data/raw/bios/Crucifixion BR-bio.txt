Crucifixion BR, Brazilian Black Metal band formed in 1996 in Rio Grande, in the south of Brazil by Lord Grave War a.k.a. Márcio Guterres and DarkMoon a.k.a. Juliana Novo, renewed the brazilian metal scene with the aim of creating an original, diabolic and brutal Black Metal, having various influences of 80's thrash metal, death metal and having as their essence the black metal roots. The band's name 'Crucifixion' was chosen by Lord Grave War, inspired by the name of a SEPULTURA song.
  In 2004 they’ve moved to Porto Alegre, constructing since then a big experience in concerts  through the southern area in Brazil, taking part of diverse festivals as the headliners, and even supported KRISIUN in their last show of the ASSASSINATION Tour in 2007. The band has previously released in their hometown, Rio Grande, two demo-CD’s in 2002, named ‘In The Shadows Of The Obscurity’ and ‘Diabolical Profecies’, having swedish musician Jan Felipe Queiroz a.k.a. Den Rode Med Horn (x-bassist of swedish dark ambient band ‘MZ.412’) as their bassist. These demos have received good reviews in metal mags around the world. Still in 2002 they took part on the national compilation ‘Metal Crusader’ by Radio Muda from Campinas/SP, being the spotlight in other metal radios and reaching the audience outside southern american boundaries.
  Crucifixion BR keeps expanding their horizons in the extreme metal scene, and the year of 2011 comes as a great year for the band, taking part on the compilation "Most Unholy Convergence II" produced by Satanica Productions from New Zealand which soon is going to be released worldwide, and recently they've finished their first official full-length album, called "Destroying The Fucking Disciples Of Christ", containing 13 tracks. Samples can be listened on the band’s Official Myspace: www.myspace.com/crucifixionbr.
  This first official album has been mixed and mastered at Hurricane Studio, a renowned studio  on the southern metal scene in Brazil, and it presents Crucifixion BR following their path in the Obscure Art without leaving their spirit and roots from their very beginning. The band is preparing to release in July an EP entitled "War Against Christian Souls", containing three tracks from their upcoming album, which will be marking their new step on the global extreme scene.
