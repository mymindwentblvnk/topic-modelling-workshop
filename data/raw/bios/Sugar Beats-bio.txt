Sugar Beats are Birmingham-based Octet - Leo Altarelli (trumpet, vocals), Mike Adlington (trumpet), Mike Fletcher (alto), Alan Gardiner (drums and percussion), Lewis Hornsby (drums), Chris Mapp (upright and electric bass), Colin Mills (Baritone) and Rob Norman (keys), with occasional, very special guest Ed Johnston (tenor). The band came about through a desire to make good quality music using real musicians whilst, at the same time, moving jazz forwards.

After putting on a series of club nights at Birmingham's Medicine Bar, which consisted of a set by a live "jazz" band with DJs playing Sun Ra and Roy Ayers alongside Madlib and Bugz in the Attic, Chris and Leo put a band together to combine these diverse influences into a single live unit.

3 years of refining and gigging later, and the second album is on the way. Recent highlights include gigs in Edinburgh, London, Oxford and Birmingham playing alongside the likes of Dom Servini, Phil Asher and Dego (4 Hero). The band has also recently been awarded a Musicians Benevolent Fund development award.
