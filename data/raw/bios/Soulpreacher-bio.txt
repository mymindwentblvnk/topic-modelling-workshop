Driven from the ashes of the sludge band Forsaken, Michael Avery (Guitar), Anthony Staton (Vokills), Mark Schindler (Drums), and Robb Hewlett (Bass) went on to form the band Soulpreacher. Their early sound focused primarily on hateful psychedelic doom metal. Mark Schindler parted ways early on, and Brian Watson was added to the lineup taking over on drums.

Soulpreacher then signed with Frank Kozik's label Man's Ruin, and soon released their debut album "Sonic Witchcraft" in 1999. The response was powerful in the doom and heavy metal scene and the band went on to release the follow-up "When the Black Sunn Rises...the Holy Men Burn" in 2000 on the Colorado label Game Two/Berserker Records.

Following Michael Avery's departure to law school in 2004, the band decided to add the double guitar talents of Chris Hill (Gods in Waiting, Sorrow Bequest (now Widow)) and Trent Giardino (Shadowlore). With the addition of the two new guitarists, the band's sound grew darker, and more melancholic. 

In 2004, the band released the "Lost Words" demo showcasing their growth and songwriting skills. With influences ranging from Pink Floyd to Slayer to My Dying Bride and Anathema, Soulpreacher continues to transcend the Doom and Heavy metal genres.

Update 2006: Soulpreacher have entered Shadowlore Studios to begin the pre-production process for an upcoming full-length album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soulpreacher">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
