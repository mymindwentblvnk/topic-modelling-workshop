Kerri grew up in the New Jersey area during the days of the infamous Zanzibar club with resident DJ Tony Humpries. Kerri's father was a DJ as well, which gave Kerri a rich background in the origins of the New York Underground Sound (known also as "Garage" music).

Kerri eventually found himself intrigued with the production element in dance music and soon began to create his own grooves on his self-label, Express Records. In 1991, Atlantic Records signed his debut single, "SuperLover/Get It Off."

In the expanses of his breaks the odd counter rhythm will inexplicably appear for a second and then disappear, creating fleshy excitement, not mechanical repetition. His basslines go from heavy and heady to playful and quirky--always deliriously intoxicating.
