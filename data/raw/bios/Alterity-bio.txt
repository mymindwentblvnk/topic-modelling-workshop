Alterity is a Darkwave/Goth Rock project, with the only consistent member being founding member Drearia from Sterling Heights, Michigan. Alterity initially began as a solo project producing EDM, but eventually Drearia wanted to pursue a new direction. Serbian Electronic producer Skveezy collaborated with Drearia alongside Sandra Bullet to form the new face of Alterity and resulted in two projects, The Life After and Afterlife. However, Skveezy left not long after Afterlife due to creative differences. American vocalist Maverick of Flight of Fire worked with the group more extensively, however, leading up to the singles Damage and Too Far Gone. Following the introduction of new member and Finnish Witch House producer LiQ, Alterity announced their album "A Sinister Night Out" to drop in June, and dropped the A Sinister Night Out single in April. Soon after, Alterity re-packaged their earlier albums as Alterwave and Neon Monsters. This set Alterity on course for a much darker image, inspired by horror films and taking influence from 90's Goth bands like Paralysed Age and Midnight Configuration.

Alterity is currently Drearia and L!Q, with Sandra Bullet and Maverick not being official members but contributing to most records and being credited without a feature in the credits of their releases. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alterity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
