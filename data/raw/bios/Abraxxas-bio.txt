It was reported on Abraxxas' now deleted MySpace profile that the artist's studio (along with the master tracks) was robbed sometime in late 2006.  More work is suspected to emerge after an hiatus, though there is no word on whether the artist will continue to produce music under the same name.  The collection of unfinished audio clips given the provisional title of "Breadwinner" is the only known document of work credited to Abraxxas. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abraxxas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
