There is more than one band by this name.

1) Scottish alternative rock quartet, The Void (now known as THE WINTER TRADITION) formed in 2003. After searching and finding a sound they all loved, they take influences from fellow Scots, Biffy Clyro, Idlewild and transatlantic Death Cab For Cutie. Each note and rhythm is carefully pieced together to bond with emotional and connectable lyrics. Each member has a strong passion towards everything they do. 

Their energetic live performances are emphasised by a variety of calm and loud sections mixed with unique timing and epic pauses. The band have journeyed all over Scotland building a following in each city that grows with each return. With the band having set up their home studio, they are constantly recording tracks to unleash to the public through their own label. With 3 Scottish tours under their belt, they have played with some of the best signed and unsigned bands in Scottish music.
