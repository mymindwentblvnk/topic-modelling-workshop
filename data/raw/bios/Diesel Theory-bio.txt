Diesel Theory is a metal band from Union City, New Jersey. The band doesn't fit into any mold whatsoever and has no preconceived notions for what it will produce. Diesel Theory writes honest, brutally heavy and trend free music. Formed in 2001, Diesel Theory has always combined the elements of heaviness, melody, and timing in their songwriting process. Tom Jack destroys both vocally and on guitar, with the inspiration of other guitarist/vocalists like Max Cavalera and Tommy Victor. Andy Hendrickson is one of the most intimidating bassists vocalists in the Metal Scene Today. Joining in the lineage of insanity which includes Lamb of God and Today is the Day, Diesel Theory recorded their first full-length effort at Austin Enterprises in Clinton, Massachusetts. Diesel Theory was the last band to record at the prestigious High Street studio that was responsible for cranking out The New American Gospel. The self-titled album was released in March 2005 and the band is currently supporting the record. Diesel Theory is one of the first bands to sign with Steve Austin's label, SuperNova Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diesel+Theory">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
