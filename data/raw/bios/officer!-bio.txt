Officer! was a french/english pop/jazz/electronic band in the mid to late 80's. They were quite unusual in the fact that they incorporated a couple orchestral instruments like the bassoon, cello, viola and harp in their instrument line up. These instruments were certainly not typical of an experimental band, nonetheless the band being members of the underground music scene blooming at this time. They have released approximately 5 or more albums. Ossification (which basically means bone tissue formation) might be their first album. It was recorded and released by Ayaa in 1984.
