Belle and Sebastian is a band from Glasgow, Scotland. Led by guitarist/vocalist Stuart Murdoch, the seven-piece band has an intimate, majestic sound that is equal parts folk-rock and '60s pop. Murdoch has a gift for not only whimsy and surrealism, but also for odd, unsettling lyrical detail which keeps the songs grounded in a tangible reality. 

Based in Glasgow, Scotland, Belle and Sebastian released their first two albums in 1996 at the peak of the chamber pop movement. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Belle+&+Sebastian">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
