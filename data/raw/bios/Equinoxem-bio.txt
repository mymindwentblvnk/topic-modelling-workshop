Equinoxem was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The idea of Matt Tallón was to seek to fuse of goth metal with differents styles like celtic music, atmospheric and symphonic metal with some pieces of melodic black metal, looking for a special own sound to give enough space to the esoteric and goth lyrics.

The band was officially born on September 21st of 2008, spring equinox for the south hemisphere.
Ashe Alder (vocals) and Nahuel Blade (Bass), with Matt Tallón (guitar/vocals) formed this project. In January 2009, they started to record the first demo/EP called "Noscete Ipsum". After that, the band completed its line up with Marina Fortino (keyboard) and Pablo Pompa (drums). During the year of 2009, Equinoxem focused on gaining more solid sound and got some interesting public reviews.

In the end of 2009 and after the last gig of the year, Marina Fortino decided to leave the band for personal reasons, but the keyboard occupation was taken by Francisco Roldán who joined the band and marked the new line-up. 

During 2010, the band worked on its debut full-lenght album, Prophecies of Soul, released on a CD in Argentina in 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Equinoxem">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
