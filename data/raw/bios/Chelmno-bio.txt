Obscure and tenebrous Dark Italian Black Metal, performed with great skills and sound! 
Chelmno is paying tribute to the old spirit, combining the austerity of BM with dark & misty visions. 
Entering the world of Chelmno you are entering the world of sinister and gloom! 

Featuring Vidharr ((Tenebrae in Perpetuum, Beatr√¨k, Near, Profezia) on drums!
