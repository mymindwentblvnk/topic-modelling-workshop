Thrawsunblat  is a "Raw Folk & Melodic Black Metal" band from Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, fronted by Woods of Ypres' final guitarist, Joel Violette. The first album, "Canada 2010", was released in late 2009 and featured Woods of Ypres frontman David Gold on drums.

Following Gold's death in December 2011 as a result of an automobile accident, Woods of Ypres disbanded and Thrawsunblat became Violette's main project. He recruited Brendan Hayter (bass) and Rae Amitay (drums) - who were set to join Woods' touring lineup in 2012 - to fill out a new lineup in preparation for Thrawsunblat II: Wanderer On The Continent Of Saplings.
