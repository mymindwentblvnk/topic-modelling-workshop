DC4 is a hard rock band based out of Los Angeles, CA. The band's current lineup consists of singer/guitarist Jeff Duncan alongside brothers Shawn Duncan on drums and Matt Duncan on bass, with Rowan Robertson on guitar. Jeff is also a member of the metal band Armored Saint and Rowan is best known for taking the lead guitar spot in the metal band Dio at the age of seventeen. 

The original lineup featured guitarist Hyland Church, but personal issues forced him to leave LA and the band. Rather than taking an ad out searching for an immediate replacement, DC4 decided to wait for the right person to come along. That person would come in the form of Rowan Robertson, who Jeff met while playing shows with Happenin' Harry, a local musician who often jams with other musicians at his club. The two hit it off and Rowan was eventually invited to come jam with the Duncan brothers in the summer of 2006. Shortly thereafter, Rowan was offered a spot in the band and he joined. In the late summer of 2006, Rowan and Jeff began writing new music together.

As 2006 came to a close, the band had enough songs to record an album and enlisted Joey Vera (Armored Saint, Fates Warning) to produce and mix the album, which began with the working title "Explode". The recording and mixing of the album took some time, since Joey and Jeff both had commitments with other bands, but the album was finally completed and "Explode" was released on October 31, 2007. 

Latest update: DC4 signed with Metal Blade and released "Electric Ministry" in 2011.
