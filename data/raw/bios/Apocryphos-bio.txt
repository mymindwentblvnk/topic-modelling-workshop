There are two different projects called Apocryphos: one dark ambient project and a defunct heavy metal band.

The dark ambient project Apocryphos is a continuation of the dissolved Psychomanteum, now including the sole member Robert. His debut album  The Prisoner's Cinema was released on Cyclic Law in January 2015.  After The Prisoner's Cinema, he teamed up with Kammarheit and Atrium Carceri to release the collaboration album Onyx.  This lead to Apocryphos joining the Cryo Chamber roster and the albums Stone Speak (2016), a follow up to Onyx titled Echo (2017) and Against Civilization (2020) were released. In 2022, the 4th album Phantoms Received was released, again through Cryo Chamber.  Apocryphos is known for its dark and melancholic sound, created mostly with manipulated guitarwork.  

The heavy metal band Apocryphos formed and started writing songs in the summer of 2003. Writing songs with time and dedication, Apocryphos brought work back into song writing and with it a style that is all their own. With three guitarists, rumbling bass, ear piercing vocals, heavy drum beats, and influence from bands all over the world, Apocryphos dominated the Solano area and many others to come. Apocryphos had influences from metal bands such as Amon Amarth, Children of Bodom, Kalmah, Norther, Moonsorrow, Blind Guardian, Kreator, Iced Earth, In Flames, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Rhapsody, Dark Tranquility, and many more. Sadly, the band played their, supposedly, farewell show on July 6, 2006, however, the break up of this band did not last. On Sep 1, 2007 they have opened for Kamelot at the Galaxy Theater in Santa Ana and on Oct 4, 2007 they opened for Folk Metallers Finntroll. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Apocryphos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
