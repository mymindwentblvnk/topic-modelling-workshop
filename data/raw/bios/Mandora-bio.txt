Formed in 2003 in Oxford, UK by lead vocalist, Katrina Bray (a New Zealander), Mandora brings a new level of gutsy female fronted rock onto the scene.

Claiming influences such as Skunk Anansie, Lacuna Coil, Evanescence, Metallica and Finch, Mandora combines aggressive driving guitars and catchy melodic hook lines with devastating vocal technique. Together with raw, energetic passion this creates a sound that is uniquely Mandora.

As no stranger to the rock scene, Katrina has toured extensively throughout the UK and Europe and has also performed live on National TV (at MTV studios, London).
