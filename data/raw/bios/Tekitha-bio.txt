Female vocalist who appeared to take the role of Wu-Tang in-house singer (previously filled by Blue Raspberry) for Wu-Tang Forever, on which she also got a solo track titled "Second Coming". Also filled in for the unavailable Mary J. Blige in the video for Ghostface Killah's "All I Got Is You". Initially signed to RZA's Razor Sharp Records and then to Ghostface's Starks Enterprise. Believed to have completed a solo album, but like many other affiliates, has not had it released. Continues to make guest appearances on Wu-Tang projects such as Raekwon's The Lex Diamonds Story (though the role of in-house singer was filled by Madame D on 2001's Iron Flag) and has also collaborated with other non-Wu artists including KRS-One and Armand Van Helden. Can rap as well as sing, as heard on Cappadonna's "Pump Your Fist" and RZA's "Mantis".
