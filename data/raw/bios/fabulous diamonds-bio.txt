Fabulous Diamonds are Melbourne duo, Nisa Venerosa and Jarrod Zlatic. Nisa plays drums and sings, Jarrod plays sax, electric organ, keys, and synthesizer through time-lag accumulators to make their unique avant-garde music humbly disguised as pop minimalism. Truly experimental, defiant of glib categorization, advanced and yet totally stoned-sounding. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fabulous+Diamonds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
