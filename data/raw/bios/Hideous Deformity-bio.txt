Hideous Deformity is a brutal death metal band from Norway. They formed in early 2006 by JÃ¸rgen (Vocals) and Robin (Guitar). The music here is very chugging form of slam death metal, but with spoils of thrash riffing and agressive drumming to make it that technically advanced than old slam death metal of the mid 1990's.

In a couple of months of forming the band were joined by Erik the band as a second guitar player, but after a little while Erik chose to leave the band because of musical differences. The plans to make their first demo started to take shape, and three songs were created that was initially going to be featured on the demo. This was self-released on cd around their local area and put on their official myspace.

The band is now working hard with sevard records who signed them shortly after the demo was released for their debut full-length album, due in late 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hideous+Deformity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
