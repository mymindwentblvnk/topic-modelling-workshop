No, P:407 is not in for mass popularity. No, P:407 is not for the emotional empty folks. And no, P:407 isn’t something for you when you’re thinking about hearing some fine tunes. 

For several years Timmermans and Dupont shared each other’s side when playing in The Quiescent (°1993 †2004). It must have been somewhere in 2002 they both felt they needed something different, something more unique than the other activities they were doing. One year later Project 407 released "Seven Days And Seven Songs" of which the few reviews made were quite positive. In contrary with both the musical and lyrical approach. After some years of absence and other priorities Timmermans and Dupont got back together to write "The Post Dagger Experience". Even more dark and more moody than it’s predecessor. Together with the new release Project 407 is officially reborn as P:407 (pronounce as [pE | for | O | se-v&n]). Again, after a long period being on ice - the 407 planned their return with "Themes For The Coming Apokalypse", set for release through ConSouling Sounds October 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/P:407">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
