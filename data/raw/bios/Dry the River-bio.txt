Dry the River were a folk rock band from Stratford, London, UK, formed in spring 2009. Frontman Peter Liddle decribes their sound as "folky gospel music played by a post-punk band". Currently, the band consists of Peter Liddle (vocals, guitar), Matthew Taylor (guitar, keys, vocals), Scott Miller (bass, percussion, vocals) and Jon Warren (drums, percussion). The original lineup also included Will Harvey (violin, viola, keys, mandolin); however, he left the band in early 2014. 
After two EPs ("The Chambers and the Valves" and "Bible Belt"), the band were signed to Transgressive Records in 2010. "No Rest", their first single on the label, was released in March 2011. They recorded their debut full-length album, "Shallow Bed", in Connecticut with Peter Katis (producer for The National, JÃ³nsi and Interpol), and released it on March 5, 2012. An acoustic version of "Shallow Bed" was released by download only on 17 December 2012. 
The band's projects also include creating a charity t-shirt for the Yellow Bird Project to raise money for Asylum Aid (in March 2011) and designing "Mammoth", a limited edition beer brewed with Signature Brew (in November 2012).
Their second album, "Alarms in the Heart", was released on August 25th, 2014. 
They announced their split on their Facebook page on 12 November 2015, along with the release of their final EP, Hooves of Doubt.

Peter Liddle crafted a solo album 'Casual Labour' released 13 July 2018, with a gang of his musical friends, including several from the Dry the River family bassist Scott Miller, keys player Patrick Pearson, string-player Will Harvey, writer Matthew Reynolds along with producer Pete Miles. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dry+the+River">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
