Houndmouth is a collaborative folk rock four-member band, formed in 2011 from the lowland plains and farmlands of Indiana, USA. The band's lyrics emphasize their foolhardiness, and their soulful harmonies carry far. Houndmouth consists of Matt Myers (guitar, vocals), Katie Toupin (keyboard, vocals), Zak Appleby (bass, vocals) and Shane Cody(drums, vocals). Folk duo Katie Toupin and Matt Myers (formerly of the Saint James Hotel) joined up with Shane Cody (Riffraff Revival) and Zak Appleby to create a colossal electric sound with bouncy half-time beats, punchy guitar riffs, and a bit of facial hair. They performed at SXSW in 2012 to promote their self-titled EP, and then were signed up by Rough Trade Records. The band have appeared on several major television shows, including Letterman and Conan.
