In spring 2000 Immortal Remains was formed by Hubert and Guido Dürr. A set of seven songs was composed in September 2001, so they could present them to the fans at the Metal Rulez 6 Underground Festival in Eubigheim. After two successful concerts Immortal Remains decided to record a promotional CD in March 2002. The first official promo-CD “Porta Ad Tenebras” was recorded in November 2003 by Kraftstrom Music Productions in Würzburg and was published in December 2003. At the end of the year 2005 Immortal Remains concentrated its efforts on composing new songs. The new records were also made in collaboration with Kraftstrom Music Productions and after a hard and intensive period of work they could present their new album “Seelenfeuer” in July 2006. After a line up change and a lot of great shows in Germany, eight new songs were composed. It meant that the time for a new CD had come so one again during summer 2008 a new CD titled “Everlasting Night” was recorded at Kraftstrom Musikproduktionen. It is a journey to their deepest inner, walking through the corridors of a lifetime with atmospheric moments versus infernal blasphemy! High pitching screams, deep growls, melodic moments silent parts create a dramatic tribute to the darkest of the nights!!! Just a few months later the band signs a deal with the label MY KINGDOM MUSIC thanks to the great interest that his boss Francesco Palumbo has shown and on March 2009 the album sees the light worldwidely.
