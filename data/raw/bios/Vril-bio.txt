Vril is a German techno producer from Hannover, Germany. He gained widespread attention in 2011 with his track “UV” on Marcel Fengler’s Berghain 05 compilation. In the following years since then, he made a name himself in contemporary techno with his unique productions on Dystopian, Giegling, and Semantica and also with his especially stunning live set. If you listening to his highly recommended album Torus from 2014, you will hear his deep and hypnotic interpretation of dub techno with experimental and ambient touches, sometimes club-focused for a dancefloor, sometimes the perfect soundtrack for getting lost or sometimes both.
