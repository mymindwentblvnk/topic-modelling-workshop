Bloody Panda was birthed in the cold sub-chambers of grim New York City, United States in 2003.
A thirst for new musical perversions besieged guitarist/firebreather Rothenberger and 4-string undulationist Camphire and the Doom Gods answered by bestowing upon them the Archpriestess of Doom, Yoshiko Ohara. Vokillist Ohara's demo ("Spiral") became the basis for early musical collaboration. Songs were composed strictly on the last day of the Earth's existence, and high peaks of scorn were exhibited thusly. Keymaster/Necromancer Black McDowell further fortified the project and the undying funeral that is Bloody Panda was hence born. Battleskins are being provided by Dan Weiss, renowned tabla and drum master of depths unknown. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bloody+Panda">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
