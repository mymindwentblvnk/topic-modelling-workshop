Formed in 2002, Unleash The Fury manages to create a unique, ferocious brutal sound. Heavy breakdowns are combined with modern agressive influences from today’s leading progressive, metal bands. Many important gigs were played during the years of their path of destruction such as Wacken Open Air 2005, the Underworld Camden (UK), Biebob, Blackbox Tour Package, Tears Of Metal 2006, Face Your Underground fest, support gigs for The Haunted, In-Quest, Gorefest, Zuul FX, Prong and many more… Unleash The Fury is now in 2012 back with a new fresh line-up and is doing shows everywhere to show their energy and dedication still. At this moment of speaking the band is writing new material possibly for an e.p.release later on. But first things first, the long long awaited debut full length record "Superior Race: Human"! All the recordings are ready and shiny! The last bits of work on the amazing artwork! This record will be released on Belgian imprint Sonic Death Metal records. You'll be the first to know when it's out!! Stay tuned! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Unleash+The+Fury">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
