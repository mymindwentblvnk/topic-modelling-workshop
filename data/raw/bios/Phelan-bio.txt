Phelan is an electronic side project based out of Manchester, UK conceived by Richard A Ingram aka Gambler formerly from Oceansize. 

Phelan touches base with Ingram's electronic and IDM influence as opposed to his work in Oceansize showcasing a more progressive rock sound and solo efforts under 'Richard A Ingram' - the minimalist "Consolamentum".
