Chooga - Dmitry Chugaev - born in 1980 in a family of cultural workers in the Far North of Russia. Polar lights, ample quantity of pure white snow, sky with billions of shining stars - everything made great impression and influenced his future life. He was always excited about creative work in all of its aspects. Studying in the music school was the first step in a desire to become a musician. Playing in the orchestra developed special understanding of the both the listener and the stage. Devotion to music was strengthened and became even more outstanding. Among those who influence a lot to his personal music visions were: Pink Floyd, Metallica later The Prodigy, Moby, Goldie and many others. He was self-teaching how to play the guitar and drums. While constantly looking for his sphere of action he suddenly realized that his path led through creating his own music. Studying the composing programs, searching for his own music style (with preference given to drum&bass), studying the basis of how to work with the sound and team-work with different musicians â€“ all this led to a firm and obvious concept of his style. Later appeared a very personalised view of music and the emotions which it should evoke. This resulted in some web releases in Russia and Ukraine: Intelligent Recordings (UA), Sub Level One Recordings (RU), One Size Recordings (RU), Soul Limited Recordings (UA). Chooga is often played on Bassdrive, Ipswich Community Radio and other radio stations all over the internet by DJ such as Stunna and DJ Fusion. His releases are heavily supported by Russian and Ukrainian DJs and musicians the likes of: Phisical Illusion, Sequent Industry, DJ Mage and many others. He claims: "I am constantly working on new ideas how the music should sound and in the near future I expect to present new releases." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chooga">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
