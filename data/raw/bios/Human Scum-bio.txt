There are two bands called Human Scum.

1) Tunisian Grindcore band.

From the guys' myspace page: The first Tunisian Grindcore band!!! Human Scum is a project between two freaks living in different countries: Mahdi from Tunisia and Nidhal, Tunisian, living in Germany.
We had connection via internet before we have been meeting each other, we spoke about different kinds of music, and we had the same opinions. As Nidhal turned back home for a holiday, we used the occasion to make the first EP, some kind of Brutal Death Metal, Grindcore, and some Crust influences... Our lyrics are mostly social. Critiques about our actual life, results from globalisation and economic wars. People forgot the real reasons of life, which became an insane battle, without taking a step back just to think about what we really are as persons, and what the reasons are that we're fighting for. As such, Grind is the way to break the social, political, ethical, and all the other kind of domination...

Line up:

Nidhal Mahmoud - bass, vocals
Mahdi Riahi - guitar, vocals, drum programming
