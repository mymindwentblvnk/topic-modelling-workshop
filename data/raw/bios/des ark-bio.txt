Des Ark originally started with Aimee Argote and Tim Herzog. With the release of "Loose Lips Sink Ships," Des Ark created itself a loyal fan base. When Tim left, Aimee decided to continue with Des Ark with a changing cast to fill in. In Early 2007 "Battle of the Beards" was released and Ashley Arnwine and Welch Canavan joined the band. Since then members have come and gone. 

Now, brand spankin' new, the trio consists of Aimee Argote, Noah Howard, and newly inducted drummer, Joshua Nee. A little bit Southern Twang, a lot of punk, Des Ark continues to carry a unique sound. 

“Des Ark is a whole different animal. Aimée Argote’s work is backwoods hippy stuff that is profane and vulgar as any lady has ever been. Her compositions are organic songs that are driven by her soulful voice holding strongly to its southern accent and are driven by acoustic guitars and pianos. If it was not for the grotesquely vulgar and overtly bi-sexual nature of her songs, they would be among the most gorgeous ever composed.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Des+Ark">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
