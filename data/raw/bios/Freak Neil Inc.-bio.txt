Freak Neil inc. is Rob Van Der Loo's solo project. Rob Van Der Loo is a great bass and chapman stick player from Netherlands .

"The album (produced by Joost van den Broek, who also plays keys in this album.) tells the story of several different characters who have to deal with their own frustrations in life.
Since each character is unique the album contains several different musical styles to reflect their personalities.
In a few words the music can be described as : Dark, raw, loud and most of all weird!"**

Even this is Rob's solo album there are also many guest musician playing on this, including some "legends" so I think they are worth mentioning here also. So, the main band in this album is Rob van der Loo: Basses, Chapman Stick, and Roel van Helden: Drums and the guests...
