Rehearsal began in spring of 2014 with intentions of creating a cohesive sound consisting of traditional and modern influences in the doom and metal genre including blues and heavy 70's rock. Our goal was not to reinvent the wheel, rather to create the music we wanted to hear. Hence the name Cruthu, Gaelic for creation.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cruthu">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
