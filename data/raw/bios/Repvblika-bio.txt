Repvblika is a metal band from Mexico City. They label themselves as black metal, and it's a definite influence in their guitar work and syncopation, but the blasts, tempo changes, and vocals have a definite death metal edge. Industrial influences are also apparent. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Repvblika">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
