Young Estonian DJ and producer Syn Cole is tipped to reach the higher degrees of EDM
stardom after being snapped up by Avicii’s record label. With a debut(!) appearance
at mammoth UK dance festival Creamfields imminent on August Bank Holiday
weekend, Cole is poised to follow through with an arsenal of electronic rockets on
the Swedish imprint.

Born Rene Pais in 1988, in the small Estonian town of Pärnu, Cole attended music
school for seven years where he studied piano. Dabbling with his first hardware
synth, the young student soon became intrigued with electronic dance music.
Experimenting further, and inspired by Roger Sanchez, Mauro Picotto and Ferry
Corsten, the inquisitive kid played around with numerous soft synths just for fun
before discovering Steinberg’s Cubase SX3, progressing onto version 6.5 and so his
tentative steps into production took on a more polished approach.

With initial forays into trance, tech-trance and progressive house under various
monikers, the young Estonian also ventured out of his homeland and into Canada,
the UK, Ireland, Russia and the Netherlands honing his DJing skills.

His raw talent and unbridled energy has attracted label manager Ash Pournouri,
readying the 24-year-old Rene for the world on another level. On his signing to Le7els, 
Cole declared: “It’s amazing to be joining such a great label. My music can flourish as 
part of the Avicii family and I can’t wait for the world to hear my first LE7ELS release.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Syn+Cole">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
