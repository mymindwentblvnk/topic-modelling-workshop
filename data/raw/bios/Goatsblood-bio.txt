Goatsblood is a Vancouver-based sludge band. The band's debut was released in 2000. A US tour in the middle of 2001 was cut short when the band's van lost its engine.
The follow-up was three years in the coming and finally hit the stores in the autumn of 2003. Drull was recorded by Steve Austin of Today Is The Day, a band with which Goatsblood had toured before. The band assembled a number of live and unreleased songs and was looking for a label to release the material come 2004.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Goatsblood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
