Mighty Oaks is the Berlin-based folk project of Claudio Donzelli, Ian Hooper, and Craig Saunders. The name is a byproduct of the group's affinity for nature, and their notion that the saying "mighty oaks from little acorns grow" is a reflection of their development together. The band has released four EPs since their formation in 2010: "Mighty Oaks" (2011), "Driftwood Seat" (2011), "Just One Day" (2012) and "Brother" (2014). Their first LP, "Howl", was released in early 2014 on Universal Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mighty+Oaks">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
