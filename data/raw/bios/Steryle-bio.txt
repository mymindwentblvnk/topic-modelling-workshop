STERyLE formed in the small town of Roxboro, NC in early 2002. And have shared the stage with such acts as The Autumn Offering (Victory Records), Hell Within (Lifeforce Records), On Broken Wings (Eulogy Records), Sworn Enemy (Abacus Records), Gretchen (MD Records), Nights Like These (Victory Records), Alesana (Fearless Records), Silent Civilian (Mediaskare Records), Joshua's Whisper(Attack/Universal Records), Knives Exchanging Hands (Tragic Hero Records),Black My Heart (Eulogy Records), Suicide City (featuring members of Kittie and Biohazard), Unearth, 36 Crazyfists, Bleeding Through, In This Moment, Bury Your Dead and more. STERyLE is the sound of five friends who got together and decided to play what they wanted to play. Even with the variety of influences, the band still continues to have it's own unique sound.

Steryle recorded an album with Jaimie King (Between the Buried and Me, Through the Eyes of the Dead, and For Today), and are trying to get the record out to labels before releasing it.  Album was finished in Summer of 2011 and will hopefully be fully released by the beginning of 2012. The album features a guest appearance from Dustie (Between the Buried and Me).
