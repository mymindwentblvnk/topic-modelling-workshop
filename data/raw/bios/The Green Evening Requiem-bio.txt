The Green Evening Requiem is from Philadelphia, USA.  Their first album, Bastards of Atlas, is now available for download at greenevening.com, and  a s/t demo CD is available from The End Records on-line via Krankenhaus Records.

Their music has been compared to Katatonia, Enslaved, Anathema, Amorphis, and High on Fire.

"Storming with a ballsy but graceful air of Viking metal meshed with Americanized prog, thrash and even folk influences, The Green Evening Requiemâ€™s melodic rock and black/death derivation is a near perfect meld of styles."  -Dave Brenner, Metal Maniacs, December 2005
