Burning Hatred comes from the east of Holland and started in the fall of 2002. After several line-up changes, a steady line-up was achieved in the end of 2004. The music is influenced by bands like Hypocrisy, Dismember, Grave and Bolt Thrower. Death metal with an old school touch, bottom heaviness and mind penetrating riffs. 

In the spring of 2005 a self-titled 4 track demo was recorded and unleashed on to the world. In the summer of 2007 a new 3 track demo “Apocalypse Of The Dead” was born. The gigs of the band are know for their energetic performance, which brought their an ever growing fan-base and positive reactions from the press.

Arnold Oudenmiddendorp - Vocals
Edwin Koldenhof - Bass
Rien Waanders - Drums
