In the summer of 2010, the band formerly known as Blinded Colony reformed as "The Blinded" with two new singers.

Joel, a long time friend to members of the band, took on the clean vocals
and brought growler Johnny with him.

The band recorded an EP with six brand new songs over the summer to show
off the new line-up.

The sound is familiar to the bands earlier work, but heavier, more
powerful and with a stronger sense of melody.

More determined than ever, The Blinded is currently writing new tracks and looking
for a suitable home for their upcoming third album.
