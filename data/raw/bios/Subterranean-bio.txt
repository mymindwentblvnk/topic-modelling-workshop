Subterranean was one of the first Icelandic hip-hop bands back in 1997. Their first album Central Magnetizm was well received by the public and sold out quickly. In the same year the band was voted the most promising band at the Icelandic Music Awards. Subterranean opened for several artists such as: The Fugees, De La Soul and The Gravediggaz, just to name a few. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Subterranean">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
