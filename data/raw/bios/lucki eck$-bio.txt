Lucki Eck$ or Lucki (real name: Lucki Camel Jr., born 30 May 1996 in Chicago, IL, United States) is an American rapper who has been frequently compared to fellow Chicagoan, Chance the Rapper. After a string of mixtapes (since 2013) and EPs (since 2015) he released his full-length studio album, Freewave 3, in 2019. His sophomore studio album, Flawless Like Me, followed in 2022. 

Lucki released much of his early work as Lucki Eck$, but is now professionally known as Lucki. However, scrobbles for Lucki get auto-corrected by Last.fm to Swedish artist Lucky Twice, so it may be a good idea to scrobble all of Lucki's work as Lucki Eck$ instead (at least it's the same artist...). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lucki+Eck$">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
