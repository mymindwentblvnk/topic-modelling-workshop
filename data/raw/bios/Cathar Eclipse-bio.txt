Native from Santiago, Chile, the two-member band Cathar Eclipse creates blackened death metal in a way never heard before in that region. The band consists of Morte and Daemoth, both former members of the legendary Maleficarium, but they reinvented their music since those days, as they became enlightened by occultism and the wise trace of history.

Formed in 2009 after years of silence, Cathar Eclipse developed a concept about the connection between mankind and their several deities, and they worked on it until a dark, brutal, yet elaborate 8-track album was born. This full lenght is called Deus Ex Hominis and it was officially released in May, 2012.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cathar+Eclipse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
