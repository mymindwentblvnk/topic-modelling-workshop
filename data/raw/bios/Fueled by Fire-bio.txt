Fueled By Fire is a Los Angeles thrash metal band. They are influenced extremely by thrash metal bands of the 1980s. Coming from the early albums and 1980s albums of bands like Exodus, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Testament and even Death Angel. They are also influenced by bands like Metal Church, Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. They are known for their appearance of tight blue or black jeans, black leather jackets, denim vests, black t-shirts of metal bands and really long hair. Their first album cover represents the Bay Area Thrash Scene of a metalhead in black clothes, black leather jacket and pants and a denim vest and long hair killing metalhead fakers which the lead singer Gio said was put there to symbolize the rivalry and war with the glam metal bands and stereotypical hair metal fans who were posers and did not know what metal was about and could not take a sound that was too metal, but yet called themselves a metalhead.
