Warp Spasm were a three piece progressive death thrash band from Hull, UK. Formed in 1990 and influenced by thrash, hardcore, death, grind & progressive rock. The line up was guitar Tommy Concrete, bass and vocals Paddy Tobin & drums Mike Shepard, 

In January 1991 they recorded a 2 track demo at The Warren and began to play gigs locally. The sound at this point was very Slayer/Venom/Motorhead. Very primitive riffs and arrangements for the most part. Psychedelic lead guitar was prevelant. 

Six months later they recorded a new demo. This was recorded at Animal Tracks studios. It was a lot heavier than the previous demo. However at the same time a strong psychedelic influence was now prevelant within the music. 

For the next year they played more gigs around Yorkshire and eventually around the UK with some of them being great. Most of the gigs came from contacts gained from reviews in fanzines. 

In summer 1992 a new demo was recorded. This was wasn't as heavy as previous releases. The technicality and musical ability was considerably higher to make up for it. The psychedelic elements were now quite firmly in place. 

They played more gigs and eventually when writing new material it became clear that the progressive elements within the music were getting stronger. Also a real desire to play slow instead of fast led to a decision to end the band. In Jan 1993 they changed the name of the band to Cosmic Juggernaut, and added Franko on keyboards.
