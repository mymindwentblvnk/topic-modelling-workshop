Logic1000 is the reclusive, Sydney-born, Melbourne-based Australian producer of electronic music, Samantha Poulter. In her making process, Logic1000 conjures concepts, genres, samples, rhythms and tempos that coalesce into a tough, stark sound that will appeal to working DJs and listeners alike. Her sound is a combination of UK-centric dance rhythms, vocal samples, hyper-accurate digital synths and disembodied textures. Her d√©but EP, Logic1000, came out in 2019. She has produced a steady stream of singles and EPs since. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Logic1000">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
