1. Catharsis was an influential American metalcore band from Chapel Hill, North Carolina that was active from 1994 to 2002. Catharsis were known for writing extremely lengthy songs (sometimes broken into multiple parts) with complex title names and unusual time signatures. They were related to anarchist collective Crimethinc..
After a couple of releases, vocalist and studio guitarist Brian D began releasing the band's albums through the anarchist decentralized collective [http://www.crimethinc.com]Crimethinc., with which he was heavily involved. Several members of the band went on to join or form other notable bands such as Zegota, Paint It Black, Requiem, 3 Inches Of Blood, Trial, Neptune, Undying, Walls of Jericho and Cathode.
Catharsis briefly reunited in January of 2013 for a series of four shows and to issue the definitive Catharsis box-set "Light from a Dead Star".
Catharsis took appreciable influence from Integrity, Neurosis, His Hero Is Gone, Breakdown, Starkweather, Amebix, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Diamanda Gal√°s, GISM, Refused and the early demo recordings of Belgian hardcore band, Negate. The dark, reggae-styled song, 'Deserts Without Mirages' on the album, Passion, is perhaps a reflection of the singer's appreciation for Peter Tosh. The song's lyrics borrow from the spoken word passages in the Godspeed You! Black Emperor song 'The Dead Flag Blues'. Passion album also samples from Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man.
