Zamboni is a three piece Thrash Crossover band from the New York Tri-State Area.  Bassist/Vocalist Chris Butera founded the band in 2010, and was soon joined by Robert Orr on lead guitar and Nathan Wolff on drums.  The band released it's first demo, "Blood on the Ice", in January of 2011, and an EP, "Mother of the Resistance" followed in April.  Although the band's first two releases were of poor quality, they began building a following thanks to their energy and attitude.  Zamboni played its first show June 15th, 2011 at the Meatlocker in Montclair, NJ, supporting a reformed Midian, as well as Terrorist and Insinnerator from Texas.  Another show followed in August, but the band was forced to put more shows on hold as the members attended their respective colleges.  Work began in November of 2011 on a new EP, then untitled.  Scheduling conflicts continued to plague the band, however, and it took over a year and a half to finish tracking all instruments for "Zamboni SUCKS!: The Stupid EP".  In the summer of 2012, Zamboni announced they would hold a Thrash Bash/ BBQ at Rob's house in Sussex County, NJ.  Nathan, no longer able to fulfill his role as drummer due to work conflicts amicably departed, and Steve Pro of local NY thrashers Bomb Scare filled in for the BBQ show and another show at the Blue Room Lounge in September of 2012.  In December, Chris met Roger Padilla, and after a couple of jam sessions, Padilla joined the band in January of 2013 on drums. Padilla's first show with Zamboni was on January 21st at the Stanhope House in Stanhope, NJ, sharing the bill with local Crust/Grindcore band Toxicology, Six in Line from Sweden and Sonic Pulse from Massachusetts.  The band is getting ready to release its second EP, "Zamboni SUCKS!: The Stupid EP" on February 8th.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zamboni">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
