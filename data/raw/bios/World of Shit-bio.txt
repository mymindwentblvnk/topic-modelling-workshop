The origins of WOS can be traced back to 1995.. A mutual bond of heavy music, weed and LSD. Eric a guitar player, Mat a vocalist/drummer. The seeds were planted then and have been slowly but steadily cultivated to create what World of Shit represents today, a project that holds true to the original creation. After a few poorly recorded demo's in 2000 and 2001, [they] finally recorded the first definitive WOS demo in 2002.  It received quite a few great reviews from countless Webzines and some major metal magazines. This demo was also released in a split with Absent/WOS on Polish label Redrum666.  Since Mat lives in Germany, Eric in Chicago-area, the next demo didn't come until 2005, pretty much negating any name recognition/momentum the 2002 demo gave them. Unfortunately Mat(Who was usually making the trip to the US for a month or 2) couldn't make it to the USA anytime soon. To avoid waiting longer Eric took on recording the drums as he also plays drums in Chicago Death/Grind'ers Morgue Supplier.. This demo while boasting a much improved recording garnered mostly positive reviews but wasn't circulated as much. Mat (meta) during this time between demo's joined Berlin-based The Ocean Collective as vocalist and recorded 3 albums: Fluxion/Aeolian and new release Precambrian, being released on Metal Blade. Today [they] present [their] third demo effort ‘World of Shit’.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/World+Of+Shit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
