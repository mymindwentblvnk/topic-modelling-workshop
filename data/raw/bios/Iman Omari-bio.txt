Singer and producer Omari grew up "all over" Los Angeles, the son of a Somalian mother and a Jamaican father, whose Temptations, Don Blackman, George Duke, and Joe Sample albums he got into. "They showed me a video of myself at my second birthday. I was holding a microphone up to my mouth. Just jibberish, of course, but my family points to it like, 'That's how I knew you were gonna sing.'"

Not only has Omari produced for Gia Scott-Heron, but also Kendrick Lamar, TiRon and Ayomari, and OverDoz. He's talented and has an impressive pedigree: His mother is Tracey Patrick of the '80s group Klymaxx, his father is a musician, and Leimberg is a trumpet player and producer for Snoop Dogg. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Iman+Omari">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
