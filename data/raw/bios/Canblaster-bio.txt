Canblaster is the prodigious child from Douai. Ultra active producer and confirmed Dj, Canblaster is the Wild Card of Club Cheval. Legendary artists such as Underground Resistance, Basement Jaxx or Yellow Magic Orchestra made him fall in love with Electronic Music. Obsessed with vintage Synthesizers, Canblaster is producing massive tracks, using Detroit pads, UK Broken rhythms, French chords and that Japanese mystical sense of melody. His tunes are quickly playlisted by Sinden, Diplo, Brodinski, Douster or Teki Latex. and his remixes for Style of Eye & Slagmasklubben, Crystal Fighters or Spoek Mathambo are here to confirm his great talent.
