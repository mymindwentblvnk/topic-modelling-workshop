Runes of the Evening are for real. This is a band that has some incredible riffs that hooked me almost immediately. This guitar sound along with the blast beats and the drummer having a fuck fest with the cymbals is that sound metal heads crave. But, then this growl-brutal delivery on vocals hits you like a ton of bricks that really make this band something really worth bragging about. This is a band that by the time you read this, should be all over that metal map. What an impressive as all fuck record.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Runes+of+the+Evening">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
