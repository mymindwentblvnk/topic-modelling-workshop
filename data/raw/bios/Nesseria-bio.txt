Beginning in 2004, Nesseria's members work with passion to create their own uncompromising extreme music, keeping intensity and energy as their only prerogatives. Nesseria always considered live performances as their main goal and form - up to today, more than 100 shows in France, Japan, Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Poland, CZ Republic, UK. 3 split CDs, one split vinyl and one album, testify their continual sonic mutation, the will to keep questioning their sound. Nesseria is more eager than ever to express its rage and disgust through creation and dedication.
