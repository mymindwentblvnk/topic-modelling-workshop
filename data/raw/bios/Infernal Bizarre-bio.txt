The roots of the band reach back to the end of nineties. After few concerts and changes in staff members, the project slowly lost momentum (private and professional life). Proper reactivation occurred in mid of 2012 - in changed crew and with new material, the Infernal Bizarre takes decision to attack again. The band operates in widely understood climates of metal - of melodic motives for heavy riffs. In 2013 they play on Ursynalia and Lemon Festival and give few club gigs. In 2014 the band still plays concerts visiting several cities and performs at Rock in Szczecin. After summer break they decide to organize something on their own, and so it’s formed in the first edition of Infernal Night in Łowicz that hosted the befriended bands from metal mainstream. After Infernal Night the band agrees to record their first professional demo. The choice is on Hz Studio from Zielonka near Warsaw, where at the beginning of November they register four tracks. Still in November the band visits Radom in order to play at Polmetal Fest 2014. In March 2015 they release the demo titled „Prometeusz”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Infernal+Bizarre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
