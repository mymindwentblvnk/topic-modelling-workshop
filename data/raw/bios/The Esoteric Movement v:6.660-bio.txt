2007 - This band came to life ( or death ) when Blackarth recorded all the instruments for this sideproject and then had to get somebody to express words on it, so Synder came along and offered a scream or two and then ... here it is, the soundtrack to our demise.

2009 - new songs being recorded for new mcd coming out soon with a new vocalist ...
