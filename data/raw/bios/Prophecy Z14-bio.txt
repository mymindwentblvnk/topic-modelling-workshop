Extreme Tech-Death Hardcore Metal band from Melbourne Florida for fans of Despised Icon, Beneath the Massacre, Necrophagist, Dying Fetus, Suffocation, Cynic, Obscura, etc. Technically proficient 7 string guitarists, and extreme metal drumming, topped with insane bass and brutal vocals. All the speed and brutality of any band in this genre but with well thought out song structures that keep you listening to see what they will do next. They were formed in 2008 as Algorithm, played some shows in Florida, recorded a couple demos, and started to build a reputation as a band who will impress you with technique, then shock you with how heavy they remain while playing the odd metered, polyrythmic stuff while still retaining an actual song with something to say. In Dec. of 2009 they started work on their full length debut CD due out in mid 2010, changed their name to Prophecy Z14 and altered the bands lineup. 

Prophecy Z14 is: 
Dan Cannon on guitars / vocals 
Damien Elder on drums
Justin Buell on guitars / vocals
(Dan Cannon played most the bass on the CD)

Prophecy Z14 exclusively plays D'addario strings, Planet Waves cables, Evans drum heads, and Line 6 amplifiers.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Prophecy+Z14">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
