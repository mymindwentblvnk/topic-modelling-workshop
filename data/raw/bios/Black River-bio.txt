Black River is a new formation from  Poland made by people from different music worlds and in Black River they have allowed everything what in their first groups was not possible. They have made really explosive mixture which gives energy injection. Black River is a return to roots, homage for tradition and analogous tone. Here is no place for cheap trash and plastic. Garage, filth and true vibration. And this is exactly what you hear on their first(self-titled) and secondBlack'N'Roll(since September 21 in Mystic Production).
