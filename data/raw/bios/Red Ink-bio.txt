RED INK are so hot right now! - After their 2009 debut “Audrey” received rotation on Triple J, Channel V, MTV and good ol’fashion Community Radio the four youngsters from Melbourne’s Mornington Peninsula have been flat stick gigging across the country with the addition to Pyramid Rock Festival, Stereosonic, Playground Weekender, One Movement & Festival of the Sun. 

With a rapidly growing reputation for their infectious tunes and sex-on-the-dancefloor live shows, the hype comes as no surprise with an increasing fan base nationwide as well as sold out venues in their hometown of Melbourne. After eagerly awaiting the lads’ second release, 2010 is setting up to be an even greater year for RED INK with their follow up coming in the form of the single “Battlescars”. 

On first listen, “Battlescars” is one of those tracks that entices the ‘fist in the air’, ‘shout out loud’ response guaranteed to set itself as a festival favourite for 2010.. But diving deeper into the musicianship and lyrical content of the track, there is a depth found in this Frankston 4 piece that far outshines their youth. 

With this single, it seems inevitable that that Red Ink will continue to succeed where others have failed. So, turn up your stereo, kick off your shoes and get ready for the most enjoyable two and a half minutes you’ve had in a long time!
