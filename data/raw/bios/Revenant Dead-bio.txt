Revenant Dead formed in a derelict Birmingham lockup in 2004 with the aim of creating the band they always wanted to see and hear.

Revenant Dead have defined their sound by combining a vast range of elements including rock ’n’ roll, progressive-rock, thrash and death metal. In a nutshell, the sound of Revenant Dead can be described as heavy, ferocious, technical and catchy.

The band started gigging the local scene under a pseudonym and rapidly increased their status. Their intense stage performances caught the attention of regional promoters; soon thereafter, the band were performing festivals and headlining events.

Revenant Dead released their full-length debut album ‘Imperial Rape March’ on the 18th September 2007. The album features ten exclusive tracks, including the first single ‘Jailhouse’.

Revenant Dead are currently working on their second album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Revenant+Dead">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
