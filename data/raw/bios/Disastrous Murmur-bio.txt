Austrian death metal band, formed in July 1988 by ex-guitarist and vocalist of Disharmonic Orchestra Harald Bezdek, drummer Manfred Perack and Manfred Fülöp. After the recording of their first 7" "Extra Uterine Pregnancy" in 1989, Manfred Fülöp left the band and was replaced by bassist Walter Schweiger.

In 1992, after the release of the band's first album "Rhapsodies In Red" Bezdek began studying in Vienna, which kept band activity to a minimum. Following the release of the band's second album "Folter" in 1994 the band split up.

in 1998 Manfred Perack, Manfred Fülöp, Walter Schweiger and Elmar Warmuth got back together, and after rehearsing old Disastrous Murmur material, decided to reform the band. This line-up lasted until 2000 when both Walter Schweiger and Manfred Fülöp left the band; shortly after, Last Dawn drummer Oliver Neussel joined on bass, second guitarist Michael Unterweger joined in 2003.
