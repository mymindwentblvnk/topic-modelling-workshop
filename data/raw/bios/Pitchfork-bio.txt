Pitchfork was a post-hardcore band, formed in 1986 in San Diego, California by Rick Froberg (vocals), John Reis (guitar), Don Ankrom (bass) and Joey Piro (drums). The bands that influenced the guys included Mission of Burma, Honor Role, Sonic Youth, Squirrelbait and more.

Compared to Froberg and Reis' later band Drive Like Jehu, Pitchfork's music was much more melodic, as well as less complex; though Froberg (then known as Rick Farr) can easily be recognized by his highly-metaphoric lyrics and screaming but melodic vocals, and Reis' guitar riffs would sound somewhat familiar to DLJ and Hot Snakes fans.

Both Pitchfork albums, Saturn Outhouse and Eucalyptus, were recorded at Radio Tokyo in 1988 and 1989 respectively and released in 1989 and 1990 on Nemesis Records. Don left the band when recording Eucalyptus to be replaced by Nick Frederick.

Eucalyptus release also featured the Saturn Outhouse 7" songs.

The Eucalyptus cover, designed by Rick, caused a little confusion for interpreting the band's name, as there was a little gap between "pitch" and "fork", so the name could be read as Pitch Fork; however, according to the most of the sources, the correct band name is Pitchfork.

Pitchfork broke up in 1990, leaving the duo of Reis and Froberg to form Drive Like Jehu and then Hot Snakes.

In 2003, Eucalyptus was re-released on Reis' own label Swami Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pitchfork">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
