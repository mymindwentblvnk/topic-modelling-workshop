The 5.6.7.8's are a Japanese all-female rock and roll group with a heavily surf-influenced garage rock sound. The band was formed in Tokyo, Japan in 1986; its current lineup consists of founding members Yoshiko 'Ronnie' Fujiyama (vocals, guitar) and her sister Sachiko Fujiyama (drums), and long-time bassist Akiko Omo. The derivation for the group's name is their sizable repertoire of rock and roll covers from the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s. Already well known in their homeland, the group first achieved international cult fame as a result of an appearance in the 2003 film Kill Bill Volume 1.

The 5.6.7.8's first started performing as a quartet in Tokyo, Japan, the fourth spot being held by a second guitarist. During a tour of Australia, the group recruited a number of guest performers, among them their only male member, "Eddie." They would become a power trio in 1992 prior to another tour of Australia, where they would play many independent venues throughout the early '90s.

Their appearance in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Volume 1 was as themselves, performing three songs -- "I Walk Like Jayne Mansfield", "I'm Blue", and "Woo Hoo" -- live at a Tokyo nightclub and sushi bar (ironically, the sequence was filmed in China). Tarantino had discovered them while in Japan, and decided to include them in the film itself. Only "Woo Hoo" was included on the film's original soundtrack.

"Woo Hoo" (a cover of the Rock-a-Teens' original hit) would achieve further fame through its usage in an advertisement for the voice over IP service Vonage in Canada and the United States. In the United Kingdom, it was used to advertise Carling brand beer. As a result of this exposure it reached #28 on the UK Singles Chart in 2004, eight years after it was originally released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+5.6.7.8%27s">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
