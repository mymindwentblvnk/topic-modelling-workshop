Born from the loin of the birthplace of metal, five Birmingham metallers came together and created a musical storm, enough to raise merry hell and judgement day itself... all whilst having a laugh and not taking themselves 'too' seriously... this is Under Blackened Skies. 

In December 2008, the last two members of the line up were determined, completing a five piece band who's extreme musical influences create an exciting explosion of metal that, combined with an electrifying and captivating live performance, has seen the reputation of UBS rapidly rise as a serious band of the future. Highlights of the flourishing career of UBS include being featured in an international magazine about Birmingham, the birthplace of heavy metal, alongside Black Sabbath, Ozzy and Led Zepp; being picked to play the first Terrorizer Grindhouse showcase in London; vocalist Manu fronting the screams for Daniel Lioneye for the Finnish, US and Canadian tour with Cradle of Filth; headlining Basementfest 2011 and playing well over a hundred gigs with truly inspirational musicians since their first in April 2009. 

Under Blackened Skies aim to break your soul with their brutality then fix it with their unique melodies, whilst entertaining you at the same time. Is that fucking possible? Now it is.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Under+Blackened+Skies">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
