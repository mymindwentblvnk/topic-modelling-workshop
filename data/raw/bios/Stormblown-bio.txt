Stormblown is a "progressive black metal" band. Their music contains several influences, such as doom metal, folk metal, death metal and classical music. 

Stormblown was founded by Alex Melching a.k.a. Skyggesang, after his first band fell apart. At first, Stormblown was the name he gave to his home-made recordings, where a sort of one-man coverband started to take form. After he recorded all tracks of Dimmu Borgir’s Stormblåst album (which is where the band’s name comes from; “stormblåst” = “storm blown”), Alex decided it was time to forge a line-up and write his own songs.

The drummer from the previous band Tjerk Hoekstra immediately joined in and a few weeks later the first rehearsal took place, with their quickly found guitarist, Jens de Vries. It was remarkable how easily songs were written and how well the new band members got along with each other, without Jens even knowing the other two prior to this first rehearsal. They still needed a bass player though, and this position was taken by an acquaintance to Jens, Ate de Vries. Again, he fitted in perfectly and the band started activities really fanatically.

Not much is there to be told right now, from this point on… More shows will be played, more songs will be written. Also, the band has released a demo, and is looking for a record label.
