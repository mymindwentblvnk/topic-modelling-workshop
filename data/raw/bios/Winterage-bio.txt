Winterage is a project born in the early 2008 from a common idea of violinist Gabriele and keyboardist Dario; they immediately enlist Riccardo, Darioâ€™s cousin, as guitarist, and they start writing the very first tracks, while searching for permanent drummer and bassist.
Between 2009 and the beginning of 2010 Davide and Matteo join the band, completing the line-up for the first local gigs, characterized by the use of the violin in place of the voice. The band develops a Power Metal sound, influenced by baroque, medieval and celtic music as well as by epic and progressive metal. After composing several instrumental songs, the band starts adding vocals and choirs, obtaining a full and powerful sound, until getting to tracks with a complete vocal line. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Winterage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
