Dark metal band from Tampere, Finland, Withered Garden started as Halls Of Mandos and released one demo under that monicker. As Withered Garden their first release was a demo tape "Watcher in the Nightsky" in 1997, followed by a MCD "Exhausted Eden" in 1998 released by the underground label Dark Moon Records, known in the Finnish undeground for a fanzine of the same name.

The sound started to change further into death metal direction after the release of the 3 song promo in 1999. As their style fully evolved into death metal and the line-up changed again, the band changed name into Sightless.

The band had recorded a full-lenght album "Heaven Raped" around 2001, before changing their name to Sightless. This album was never officially released but was available for download for a while on Sightless' website. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Withered+Garden">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
