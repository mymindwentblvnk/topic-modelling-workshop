An oft-lauded Swedish thrash metal band. Their only release LP is "Then Came the Killing" (1990, Active Records), which could be described as a mixture of Testament and Vio-Lence. Before that, they produced two demos (Frozen Soul (1988), Cross of Tormention (1989)), an untitled demo in '91 and a DVD featuring various live gigs, demo material, etc. The band has been defunct since the early 90's.

There is another German band called Mezzrow, playing rock-n-roll and Chicago-style blues. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mezzrow">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
