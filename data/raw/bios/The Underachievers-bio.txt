2. Punk band from Manasquan, NJ.
1986 - "Skip The Salad" demo cassette
One-sided demo cassette from 1986 of pretty basic 4-chord hardcore punk songs. Has kind of a Ramones vibe in the riffing. This sounds like something that would have came out much earlier than '86, but it's refreshing to hear such straight-forward punk coming out of NJ at that time. Oh, and they cover the most covered song in the history of hardcore, "Stepping Stone". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Underachievers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
