Malz Monday is rapidly emerging as a force to be reckoned with in modern hip hop. With lyrics that delve into his complex upbringing and the dark side of modern society, he is establishing himself as a compelling artist with a vital story to tell. 

A native of Ossining, NY, Malz started rapping while attending school in Yonkers, home of the legendary DMX. He would later attend high school in Atlanta, where he continued to develop his unique voice. He started his career dropping new freestyles every Monday, which eventually led to him acquiring his stage name. Eventually, he made his official debut with ‘Baby Boy,’ which firmly established him as an important new talent. 

Malz Monday went on to make his full length debut in 2020 with the self produced, “Thank God It’s Monday.” With its brutally honest lyricism and ultimately hopeful outlook, the album is a glimpse into the mind of a natural-born storyteller. With new releases scheduled for 2021 and beyond, Malz Monday is poised to be a fixture of the hip hop scene for years to come. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malz+Monday">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
