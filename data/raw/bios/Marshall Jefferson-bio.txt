Marshall Jefferson (born September 19, 1959) is widely regarded as one of the leading innovators of the genre of music now known as house music, in particular the subgenre of Chicago house. Born in Chicago, Illinois he was originally a producer in the Universal recording studios in Chicago it is here that he met owner of Trax Records, Larry Sherman. He may be best known for inventing the squelchy acid house sound on tracks like "Dream Girl" and "Acid Tracks". However he was also very influential in the more soulful or "deeper" end of the house spectrum where he produced great music by the likes of Ce Ce Rogers, Sterling Void as well as the first two albums of Ten City.

In October 2004 Move Your Body appeared in popular videogame Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, playing on House Music radio station SF-UR. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Marshall+Jefferson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
