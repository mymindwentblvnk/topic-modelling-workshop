Edge of Chaos conducted by knd-1(born in Japan - guitars/programming/producing) started in 2000. After releasing some informal tracks, they dropped their first album "Spinnenseide" in 2008 through only digital distribution. This album contains 10 instrumental rock tasted tracks. Their music taste covers all over the genres. We can see the large influence from progressive rock (Frank Zappa, Björk, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Art of Noise, and so on), experimental jazz (Miles Davis, Medeski,Martin and Wood, Marc Ribot, Bill Frisell, Henry Threadgill, Tim Berne, and so on), contemporary music (John Zorn, György Ligeti, Steve Reich, Nino Rota, and so on), ambient, techno groove, Indian classical, Latin groove, avant-garde, noise. After several months from first album releasing, they dropped their second album "Axis of Evil" through digital distribution. This is a chaotic hardcore avant-garde digital or guitar noise flood. At the end of 2009, they dropped two albums "Skin" and "Flesh" as a pair, and these albums are released also as physical CDs (different masters are used between each of digital versions and physical versions of these two albums). Currently they are working with RanDallk (he is also the producer of "Skin" and "Flesh") on his new album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Edge+of+Chaos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
