PawPaw Rod is Rodney Hulsey, a singer and rapper hailing from Oklahoma City.  Rod debuted at the end of 2020 with “HIT EM WHERE IT HURTS”, which blended 60s soul with the cadence of hiphop – like a woozier Bill Withers or Gil Scott-Heron. The record quickly found its way to the top of global viral charts and in an Apple commercial too, with not much information out there about Rod except that he was a Capricorn who loved cowboy boots.  “A PawPaw Rod EP”, released 17 September 2021 on LA's Godmode (Channel Tres, Yaeji, JPEGMAFIA), intended to fill in the gaps. Musically, it's a focused four-song offering that follows the contours of "HIT EM", co-written and produced entirely by Godmode head honcho Nick Sylvester with help from longtime collaborator Adam Moerder. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/PawPaw+Rod">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
