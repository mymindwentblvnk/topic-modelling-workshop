There are two American rock bands with this name:

1. The Go is a band from Detroit, that began as a garage punk band in 1998. It is notable in part for original lead guitarist Jack White, whose sloppy, overdriven distortion-laden and sometimes blistering solos were early echoes of the type of minimalist, raw, lo-fi sound with which he would achieve fame in his other band, The White Stripes. Upon White's departure in early '99, The Go has evolved in recent years to a neo-classic rock blend of 60's and 70's influences. The Go is composed primarily of Robert "Bobby" Harlow (vocals), John Krautner (guitar, bass), Marc Fellis (drums), James McConnell (lead guitar), and a rotating cast of other band members. The Go now play as Conspiracy of Owls.

2. The Go was a punk and power pop influenced rock group from Yonkers, New York. It was active from about 1979 to 1982. They played in the famous CBGBs club, they and later released their sole EP in 1980 with the help of Rob Freeman (the same engineer often used by the Ramones). They are currently perhaps best known for the song "Don't Take Her Away" from said EP. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Go">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
