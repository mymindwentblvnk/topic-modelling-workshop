Transylvanian Black Metal band with influences from first and second generation Black Metal, Thrash Metal, Doom Metal and Punk.

Formed in 2003.
Their name was taken after a massacre of January 1764.
The events remained vivid in the Székely collective memory: in 1905, an obelisk was erected at Madéfalva, on its top carrying a Turul-bird with the wings spread. At the bottom of the stone-pyramid there is a plate with the word SICVLICIDIVM on it (oddly enough, adding up the values of the letters as Roman numerals, the result is exactly the year of the massacre).

The band is consisted of Pestifer (guitars, bass, keys, music) and Lugosi Béla (vocals, lyrics, concept), always helped by Khrul (drums), Nekroführer (additional guitars, bass, engineering, mix and mastering) and Fred (trumpet).

Sometimes the band uses trumpets, jew's harp, acoustic guitars for generating eerie and atmospheric musical landscapes.
