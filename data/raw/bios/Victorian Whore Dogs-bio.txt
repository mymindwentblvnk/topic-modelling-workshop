Steve is a terrible experiment gone wrong. Half man, half fig roll, he stalks the streets of Victorian London devouring his own kind (human/figs) like some kind of cannibalistic bummer.
 
Andy once saw a goat in a field once. He laughed. Then it kicked his ass. It totally had robot legs though, so fair dues. After this he vowed to never mock livestock again incase it possesses bionic augmentation.
 
Adam is the youngest member of the band and therefore has to be spoon fed all his meals. His favourite food is Cow & Gate Parsnip and Vindaloo. mmm yum yum, nom it all up. And beer.
 
Barney likes rubbing shoulders with celebs and once appeared on Dancing with the Stars. Unfortunately he misunderstood the premise and bought a massive, luminous ball of plasma held together by gravity as his dancing partner. The audience was incinerated but Bruce Forsyth escaped with minimal burns.
 
Newest recruit to the band Steve Emerson is in some ways a lot like Wolverine, except rather than having an adamantium skeleton, Steve's bones were actually replaced with seaside rock candy. If you were to take a cross section from these candy bones you would see the words "Living La Vida Loca" engrained within. an adage that he hopes to live up to throughout his life.
 
VWD are fronted by former Zero Cipher decksman Barnaby ‘DJ Force-X’ Whattingham and completed by Steve Emerson, Andy Nuttall, Adam Crawley & Stephen More. They have already shared the stage with such bands as Bloodloss, Karn8, Primitai, & Illuminatus. 

Described as a cross between Iron Monkey & Will Haven put this band in a dark, dirty place where they will thrive, spinning vivid tales of an undead apocalypse, obsession, sex and violence.
 
Their debut V.W.D. CD is available now from http://vwdstore.bigcartel.com/
