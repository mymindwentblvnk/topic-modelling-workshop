The Advisory Circle is Cate Brooks (formerly of King of Woolworths), a part of the Ghost Box label. Her music reflects the electronic soundtracks of the Public Information Films and Programmes for Schools and Colleges of British 70s TV.

Three records have been released so far: the EP Mind How You Go and the full-length CDs Other Channels and As The Crow Flies. An expanded edition of the Mind How You Go CD was released on 3/3/10 on 12" and mp3 download. This included reworkings of tracks by Belbury Poly and Seeland as well as 2 new tracks. It was the first Ghost Box release on vinyl.

In 2011, the third album, As the Crow Flies was released, which saw the introduction of acoustic instrumentation into the usual stylings of The Advisory Circle while 2014's From Out Here would see a darker shift. The most recent release is 2018's Ways Of Seeing.
