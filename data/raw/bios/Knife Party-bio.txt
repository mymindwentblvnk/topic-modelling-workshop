Knife Party is the electro house duo founded by Rob Swire and Gareth McGrillen, members of Australian drum & bass band Pendulum.

To date, they have released four EPs: 100% No Modern Talking, Rage Valley, Haunted House, and Trigger Warning EP. They have also collaborated with Swedish House Mafia on their single, Antidote.

Their debut studio album, Abandon Ship, was released in November of 2014. Abandon Ship saw a deviation in sound from the heavier dubstep sound Knife Party had become known for on their earlier EP's, incorporating elements of more mainstream electro house. Originally scheduled for 27th October, unforeseen circumstances caused the album's release to be pushed back to 24th November. However, an accidental iTunes leak on 7th November made it available for download more than two weeks early to those who had pre-ordered it. 

In March of 2015, at Miami's Ultra Music Festival, they debuted three new tracks, including a collaboration with Tom Staar, and later teased at a collaboration featuring Tom Morello of Rage Against The Machine. On 24th July 2015, Knife Party announced via their official Twitter that fans could expect their next release, entitled Trigger Warning, to be released within the next 6-8 weeks. However, due to difficulties clearing samples, it was delayed until 20th November.
