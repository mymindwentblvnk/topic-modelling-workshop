Trench Warfare is hatred and violence from the wasteland of West Texas. The Midland, Texas-based musicians are heavily influenced by bestial black metal, Florida death metal and war metal. There are no beautiful melodies, no grooves, no slams, no fucking breakdowns. Just pure HATE, VIOLENCE, AND WAR. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trench+Warfare">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
