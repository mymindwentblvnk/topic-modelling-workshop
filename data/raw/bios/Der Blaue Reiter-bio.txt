Der Blaue Reiter are a Catalan/Swedish neoclassical darkwave / martial industrial project founded in Barcelona, Spain by Sathorys Elenorth and Lady Nott. Both are known for the medieval neofolk project Narsilion. However, Der Blaue Reiter is darker in atmosphere and musically has more resemblances to the apocalyptic and martial side of post-industrial music. In 2014 Lady Nott handed over her part in DBR to Cecilia Bjärgö Arcana / Sophia. 

They have released 7 albums: "Le paradise funèbre, l'envers du tristesse" (2006), "Silencis" (2008), "Nuclear Sun" (2009), "Le paradis funèbre II" (2014), "Fragments of life, love and war" (2016), "Contaminated" (2107) and United yet Divided (2019)
