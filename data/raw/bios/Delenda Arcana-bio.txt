Formed in the beginning of 2003 by Orath and Fenrisulfr in the city of Jundiai/SP, the band Delenda Arcana, makes a Pagan Metal very qualified, looking for in your sonority the originality and escaping from the current clich√©s. The melody of your music is outstanding and in spite of the influences that the band possesses, it is impossible to confuse Delenda Arcana with other names of the extreme metal. Finally, Delenda Arcana does a glorious chaos of the music perpetuating an infinite holocaust in the world of Metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Delenda+Arcana">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
