The "Cleaners from Venus" started as a home-produced D.I.Y.-ethic combo in 1980 in Wivenhoe, England, United Kingdom featuring the songs of Martin Newell and the drumming of his friend Lawrence Elliot.  Lol later left, and a number of people passed through the ranks, including Giles Smith, who subsequently wrote about his time in the Cleaners in his book "Lost In Music".

Pressures of touring lead Newell to leave the band, which struggled briefly on without him.  Newell later teamed up with bassist Nel, to form "The Brotherhood of Lizards", releasing one home-made tape and one album on Captain Sensible's Deltic records, and most famously undertaking a promotional tour by bicycle. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cleaners+From+Venus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
