Forestfather began in mid-1998 under the name of Eternal Winter as a one-man band created by Kveldulf Bjalfason, as a death/ black metal band. From 1998 to 2005 Kveldulf composed many songs just for himself, without any need nor desire to keep records of them, let alone publishing them, excepting raw recordings whose goal was to hear the compositions as a whole so far.

In late 2006 He decided to record some material to show his musical work, especially to his closest friends. Finally in early 2007, Kveldulf started to record some songs at home with the help of a friend who made the grim vocals. On that occasion were recorded 2 songs, which resulted the first untitled demo. In 2008 he recorded the instrumental 'Nostalgia' along with other songs that will be probably released at some point under different name, since it does not match the current direction of the project.

In 2010, Alwentraru joined the project, as vocalist. With his collaboration, the EP 'A Tale of Memories' was recorded, which is still unreleased due production issues. His release date has not been decided yet. Due the aforementioned production problems and a new set of songs composed during the recording sessions of 'A Taleâ€¦', Forestfather decided to work on a full length album, which is currently being recorded with a new line-up, with Michael Rumple (Desiderium, Sul ad Astral) as vocalist and Jared Moran (54R, Filtheater, Uzumaki, etc) as drummer. The album - untitled yet -  will be released within the next months.
