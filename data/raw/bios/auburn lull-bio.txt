Auburn Lull create lush space-rock and ethereal, Brian Eno-inspired soundscapes, at once filmic and pastoral. Despite the fact that the once-thriving Michigan space-rock scene has all but faded out, Auburn Lull continues to evolve their brand of technicolor sound, steadily attracting critical acclaim and an ever-growing fan base. Auburn Lull formed in Lansing, MI in 1994 by Jason Kolb (guitars), Eli Wekenman (guitars), Sean Heenan (guitars, vocals), and Jason Weisinger (drums).

The band instantly became associated with other like-minded bands from south-east MI, particularly Mahogany, with whom they released the Dual Group EP in 1997, which received airplay on the John Peel show and was called "drop-trousers gorgeous" by the Ptolemaic Terrascope.

In 1999, Mahogany's Andrew Prinz produced and designed the sleeve for Auburn Lull's debut full-length, Alone I Admire; a second long-player is expected in 2002. Alone I Admire is also slated for re-release by the Sacramento-based label Darla Records.

Auburn Lull's 7" release for Zealrecords, Behind All Curses of Thought Lies the Ability to Focus on Vacant Spaces, was also designed and produced by Prinz, and features two new compositions tinged with antique synth and subdued drum machine.
