Insentient is a Los Angeles, USA based blackened death metal band formed in 2009 by guitarist/vocalist Leslie Medina, who now joined by Kimberly Orellano on guitars, William Palacios-Toledo on bass, and James Coppolino on drums. Now complete, the band looks to unleash its assault on the metal masses with its unique metal stylings.

The style we have has drawn comparisons to bands like Death, Dissection, Hypocrisy, and Necrophobic, to name a few. Expect to hear some melodic guitar riffs, guttural vocals, intense blast beats, with a touch of shred guitar. Audio samples can be found on www.facebook.com/insentientofficial
