Screaming out of ISTANBUL; metallers SOUL SACRIFICE have spent over a decade tirelessly working to make a name for themselves, something they could easily succeed with on new opus “CARPE MORTEM”. Leading on from “STRANDED HATE” the band employed the talents of the legendary DAN SWANÖ, a well known producer in metal genre, to produce their greatly anticipated follow up “CARPE MORTEM”, a rousing album filled with the scathing riffage, soaring vocals and pneumatic drumming that will whet the appetite of any budding metal lover.

Hard working, musically dextrous and incredibly ambitious; ISTANBUL’s SOUL SACRIFICE are ready to make huge waves throughout the world and with “CARPE MORTEM” they’re more than capable.
