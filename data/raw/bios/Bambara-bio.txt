Recalling the brooding filth of early Swans, The Birthday Party, and the pummeling energy of The Jesus Lizard or Iceage, Bambara create an unsettling, visceral experience. Bambara formed in Athens, Georgia in 2008 and is comprised of twin brothers Reid and Blaze Bateh, and childhood friend William Brookshire. The band moved to Brooklyn in 2011 to further pursue making music.

With a minimal recording set-up and little sunlight, the band was able to completely capture the dark, grimy, noisy sound they are known for while maintaining the lush beauty that glues it all together. Reid’s voice croons and snarls the fragmented images of the city. Blaze and William’s driving rhythm section plows and swings through the dirge of vocal noise with furious power. BAMBARA doesn’t want you to get comfortable in Dreamviolence. They prefer to send you through vortexes of haunting noise before you reach the dreamy euphoria waiting in the wreckage.
 
BAMBARA toured Europe with A Place to Bury Strangers and again with METZ in the fall of 2013.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bambara">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
