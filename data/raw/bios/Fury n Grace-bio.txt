Fury 'n' Grace
- in the persons of Christian Grillo, Gabriele Grilli, Matteo Carnio and Emiliano "Kiske" Bertossi - outlived our expectations.  

Started in 1994 like a dream of mirrors and childhoods, it turned out to be a lucid nightmare - that involved also, in its early years, Lorenzo Bassignani, Alessandro Del Vecchio and Stefano Di Garbo; a project in which our musical research was proportional to our sinking.

Being involved in such (aesthetical and ethical) process meant that our "moving" choices in Art had to coincide with our lives. Drawing nourishment from our more intimate cracks and personal disorders, we eventually reached a point of no return.  

Blessed with twelve years of mortifications (a couple of unpublished albums -"Madrigal - Mephisto's Waltz" 1998, "Inferno" 2003-, psychophysical health-threatening side projects -that ironically reached publication-, dealing with producers and anti-aesthetical gentlemen who agreed with existence and handle its "sense" as if they're very comfortable with it) Fury 'n' Grace is now ready to shape (in both live and studio contexts) into a new monster its scariest incarnation.  

A twisted experience of Unheimliche where we hide to disappear, for a moment, through fury, to the grace of  Inorganic.
