For millennia humanity has wasted its time trying to determine what is real. We have nothing to show for these ages of collective thought. Nothing. We have failed for one simple reason: nothing is real, save the worm.

The worm does what it will, and we are all its passengers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wormrider">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
