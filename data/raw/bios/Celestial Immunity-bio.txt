Celestial Immunity were formed in Alexandroupolis - Greece, in 2006 by George (vocals) and Mike (drums) with the vision of delivering extreme metal which over the years evolved into a music mostly influenced by bands of the Gothenburg Metal scene, like At the Gates, Dark Tranquillity and early In Flames. In 2009 they released a 5-track demo CD entitled "Lost in Shades" which gave them the boost that allowed them to perform live on several gigs sharing the same stage with well known and respected bands like Rotting Christ, Septicflesh, Nightrage and Sodom. In 2011 they recorded their debut full-length album "Beyond Oblivion" produced by Marios Iliopoulos, guitarist and founder of Nightrage. However, it was independently released 3 years later in 2014 due to financial difficulties. The band is currently in search of session musicians to fill the empty guitar spots, allowing a return on stage hopefully in the months to come. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Celestial+Immunity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
