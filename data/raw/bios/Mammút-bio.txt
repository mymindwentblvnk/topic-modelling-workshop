MAMMÚT is a band from Reykjavik, Iceland consisting of three women and two men in their 20's. The band was founded in late 2003 by (ex) bass player Gunna, vocalist Kata and guitarist Alexandra. Early in 2004 drummer Andri, and guitarist Arnar joined, making the band multi-gendered.

March 2004 saw Mammút winning the annual Icelandic battle of the bands, Músíktilraunir. This competition has been the springboard for some of the most promising bands and artists in Iceland. Their prize was a free studio session in Sigur Rós's recording studio, Sundlaugin. 

Mammút's self-titled debut, was released on the 3rd of April, 2006. Soon after, the bass player Gunna quit and Vilborg Ása took her place, just as Mammút's follow-up album, Karkari was being released in Iceland on Record Records. The album's track Svefnsýkt", was well-received in Iceland, maintaining top popularity at a popular radio station three consecutive weeks.

Both Rolling Stone and Music Week have predicted Mammút to be a rising star. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Mamm%C3%BAt">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
