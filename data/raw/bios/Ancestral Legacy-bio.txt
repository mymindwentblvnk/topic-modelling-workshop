Ancestral Legacy is a continuation of the original band Permafrost that saw it's birth the last days in 1995. Around 1998/99 and the inclusion of keyboardist Øyvind Rosseland to the original line-up of Eddie Risdal (Guitars, vocals) and Kjell-Ivar Aarli (Bass, vocals) the band changed their name to the slightly more sophisticated Ancestral Legacy.

A couple of demos were cut in 2000 and 2002 before both Rosseland and Aarli left the band. Risdal took the opportunity to lead the band in an new direction, letting out the keyboards and instead include female vocals, adding Elin Anita Omholt behind the microphone. The other new additions were Børre Iversen (drums), Tor Arvid Larsen (guitars) and Anton Dead, aka Atle Johansen (bass). Three more demos were cut in 2003 and 2004 before the band shoot their first music video for the song "Crash Of Silence" in late 2004. On the live scene there has been less activity than prefered, but the highlight stands as the participation on the biggest showcase/festival in Norway, by:Larm, in Stavanger, February 2005. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ancestral+Legacy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
