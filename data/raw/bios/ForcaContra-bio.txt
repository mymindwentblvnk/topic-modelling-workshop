ForcaContra are a Metal band with Psychedelic feel and energetic riffs. Started in November 2004 by students; Alban& Daniel, both friends and influenced by Metal bands. They shared the same dream, which is starting a band and express their thoughts to the world. Soon to be joined by Shuster a student from the same college as Alban and Daniel, who's interests were the same, of making this dream happen. The guys worked as a 3 piece band and surely needed a good drummer for their style, in June 2005 Stephan, a guy they met through a friend in his birthday he joined the band and the guys were impressed with his performance. The band had a break in Summer 2005 but Alban was still composing and working on new songs. The band got back into work in September and started working on the new song. The band struggled finding the right bassist until October 2005 when Kris rehearsed with the band and they were pleased with him. Many changes have happened to the band including the roles in the band and their developing style. But ForcaContra sticked to their favourite style which is Metal. The band played their first gig downstairs at the Garage in London. Since then the band's been playing more gigs and attracting attention and building a stronger fan base.ForcaContra have been working on new material by adding different elements to their sound...new songs are coming out soon...here are few you should watch out for:
