Rawhide was formed in 1977 and has been the premier bluegrass band in Belgium. Over the years, Rawhide won several contests and awards in Belgium, Holland and at a prestigious international bluegrass festival in Toulouse, France. 
Rawhide’s strength is their high level of musical talents as well their vocal abilities. This allows the group to perform a broad range of musical styles. This album boasts a wide variety of material from contemporary bluegrass such as Kathy Kallick’s “Broken Hearted Lover,” Tim O’Brien’s “The Highroad” to the Lennon and McCartney composition “I Will,” and the swing classic “It’s Too Hot for Words.” Instrumentals include the traditional “Red Haired Boy” and the medley “Old Mother Flanagan / Green Fields of America,” the band’s original “Lassie” and a sprightly and humorous version of Leroy Anderson’s “The Typewriter.” A capella close harmony songs include Doyle Lawson’s arrangement of “Sweet Chariot,” the African-style version of “Shut De Do” and the classic “Tie A Yellow Ribbon ‘Round The Old Oak Tree.” 
This debut album “Not Too Strictly” gives a good overview of Rawhide’s broad repertoire. The group also delivers a very entertaining and humorous stage performance.
