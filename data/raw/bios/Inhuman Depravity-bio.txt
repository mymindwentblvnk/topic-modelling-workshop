Inhuman Depravity is a music band from Kadiköy-Istanbul, formed in late 2013 to do some piece of death metal. During the next months they made a 3 track demo, based on the theme that gives band’s name: ‘depravity’. Not so long after, band started to work for the debut album. Mixed & mastered by Ünsal Özata, the band's 9 track debut album Nocturnal Carnage By The Unholy Desecrator is going to be released in the beginning of May 2015 by Coyote Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inhuman+Depravity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
