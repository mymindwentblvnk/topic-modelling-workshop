Poppy Seed Grinder is a brutal death metal band, since it's foundation in the 
late 90'. We play in an uncompromising way- partly with HC influences. Our goal is to perform perfect gigs: BDM with HC influences, based on strong guitars and extreme vocals. We always want to continue moving forward and make sure that every album we record and every show we play is as perfect as possible.

Poppy Seed Grinder is an experienced band, having played nearly 400 shows, 
3 European tours, 3 albums (2002 Talk Evolution, 2004 Oppressed Reality, 2008 Humanophobia) + various compilations and demos.. We have played alongside such legends as: Avulsed, Cannibal Corpse, Kataklysm, Hypocrisy, Dying Fetus, Misery Index, Mastic Scum, Sinister, Macabre, Krisiun, Immolation, Inhumate, Napal Death, Vader, Rompemprop, Cock And Ball Torture and many more.
