Ken Licks Barbie is a  three piece hungarian sludge/stoner metal band with the main influence of the 90's stoner metal bands. Their songs were created with the use of a shitload of alcohol and stuff. The band was formed in 2012 when the singer/bassist Gergő and the guitarist György drank their "játszunmárvalamit" beer. Their first release came out in September 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ken+Licks+Barbie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
