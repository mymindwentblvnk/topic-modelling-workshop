Power metal super group The Ring emerged from Stockholm, Sweeden in early 2004 and consists of  three musicians ( Pontus, Jakob and Marcus) who started the band in order to remind themselves of why they started making music in the first place. This drive leads them as a band to combine heaviness found of Dio-era Black Sabbath, riffery of early Metallica, twin guitar lines of Judas Priest and then to work it all into a flowing concept album. Being Swedish, they also supplement Nordic harmonies that are sometimes reminiscent of folk music and old classical masters of Scandinavia (Grieg, Sibelius).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Ring">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
