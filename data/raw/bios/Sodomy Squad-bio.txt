This Australian band doesn't take itself too seriously. Formed in 2007, Sodomy Squad's major aim was to punish anuses with both phallus and music. The band claims their sound as "sloppy, insulting, blackened punk metal". Influences mainly come from Nattefrost, Toxic Holocaust and Municipal Waste. Songs include Run For Your Life, Leper Fetish, Semen Thief, Beer and Metal, Could You Lend Me Some Thrash Mate?, and Gangraped by the Holy Trinity.
