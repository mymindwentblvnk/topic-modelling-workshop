Evil Drive from Finland was founded in January 2013, with the final group coming together by spring 2013. The band was created to sound like something that the band members wanted to see in live performances and hear on records themselves; melodic metal with a hint of thrash combined with shout-like female vocals along with occasional clean singing. The songs are easy to adopt, and the most effort shows in the chorus-parts. The bass players skills bring the song more alive in the easy parts. The players have over 10 years experience of recording bands and hundreds of gigs behind them. Evil Drive is aiming for success already having enough material for a full length album. The making of their first music video starts in September 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Evil+Drive">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
