Allegory were a short-lived American goth band from Stone Mountain, GA.  They released one three song demo in 1995 and then the band broke up, never delivering the much anticipated studio album Manforgot. They opened for such bands as Attrition and Thanatos.

Band Members:
Vocals: Kain Kyy Zazas
Guitar: Lokin
Synth & Percussion: Avis
Bass Guitar: Stephanie (Kala)

They also had a track called "Score" on The Pink & The Black 2 CD set.

Avis is currently in the band Sunday Munich.

They were interviewed in the Summer 96 issue of Permission magazine.  On the back of the magazine are instructions for ordering Manforgot, but the CD is still unavailable.
