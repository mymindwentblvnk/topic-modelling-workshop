Born in 1951, Montego Bay, Jamaica, Winston "Niney" Holness, or "Niney the Observer," was one of the premiere Jamaican producers of the 1970s. Under the tutelage of producer Bunny Lee, and later Lee "Scratch" Perry, Niney crafted what would become his signature "Observer" sound. His studio band, The Observers, furnished a raw, yet robust sound that often featured plucky guitar riffs. He shaped the reggae soundscape of the 70s working with artists like Dennis Brown, Gregory Isaacs, Dillinger, Leroy Smart, Max Romeo, the Heptones, the Mighty Diamonds, and Tommy McCook (to name a few). Niney's baritone vocal stylings appear on the tracks "Aily and Ailaloo," "You Can't Enter Zion With Your Big Checkbook," and "Blood & Fire (12" Disco Mix)." Having taken some breaks in the late 70s and early 80s, Niney has managed to stay relatively active in the music industry since his breakthrough in 1970.
