Ice Howl is the solo project of ex-Thorr-Axe drummer Jason Roach. The band's music is a blend of traditional, stoner and Power metal characterised by Roach's trademark catchy hooks and choruses.
To date Ice Howl has released two albums, two EP's and a number of singles, including the 2020 Christmas song 'Santa's Slay'. The latest release is Cadence of the Cursed (2020).
The debut album, Crack the Earth (2020) is notable for being the only Ice Howl release to feature other musicians. These are Tucker Thomasson (Throne of Iron)  on bass and Niko Albanese (Avakr) on drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ice+Howl">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
