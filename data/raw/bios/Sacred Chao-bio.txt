In 1989, a split between members of Living Death generated two different bands with the same name.  One with the Kelch Brothers (Dieter Kelch and Riener Kelch), and the other with Toto, Fred and Atomic Steif.  The Kelch brothers kept the original name Living Death, the other band changed its name to Sacred Chao.   Sacred Chao only released a 4 song EP in 1989 and disbanded in 1990. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sacred+Chao">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
