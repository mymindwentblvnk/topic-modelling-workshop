Escapetor was originally established in 1999 by Ragnar A. Nord-Varhaug and Leif-Ove Haugstad as a Thrash/Heavy metal band. Their goal was to write and perform their own material which is recorded and produced in their own studio. A total of 4 Demos, 2 LP, and 2 EP's have released between 1999 and 2014 with various changes to the line-up, and then in 2014 Escapetor's latest creation 'Fear' was recorded and released.

The current line-up representing Escapetor is: 

    * Ragnar and Leif-Ove are the only original members today.
    * Claudius Bormuth joined in 2012 on vocals
    * Dan Gundersen joined the band as bassist in 2014.
    * Axel Feller joined as lead guitar  in 2010

Ole Egeli (previously k[nine], Imprint, Gehenna) joined in May 2008 on lead-guitar and stayed with the band until September 2009.

Escapetor is a band with stylistic references to metal music from the 80ies heavy-metal to the contemporary metal scene with influences across many genres. Escapetor's music is fast and heavy; Thrash Metal is the easiest label to use. Metallica, Annihilator, Anthrax, Kreator, Testament, Pantera and Slipknot are names used to describe Escapetors influences.

Escapetor has traditionally created all their music during rehearsals in studio where a number of influences are brought together from the different members of the band, creating a distinct style & sound. Honorable mentions goes to Escapetor's interpretation of the Norwegian folk-song "The Crow Song", which by the most eager fans has been proclaimed a true local metal legend.

Escapetor releases Misanthropia in April 2009. This recording reflects a slight change of Escapetor shape, form and content. The core element of old-school thrash metal is retained whilst elements of progressive and more melodic metal are thrown into the mix to demonstrate Escapetor's capabilities as a band with a future and an attitude that will continue to build a bigger audience.

Escapetor's members are currently managing, producing and distributing their music without dedicated management or administration. Since the new line-up got together in 2008 Escapetor has had a number of successful concerts, with the highlight being Sandnes Rock Fest in May 2009 and Southern Discomfort in September 2009.
