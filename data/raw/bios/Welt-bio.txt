Formed in 1993, punk rockers Welt hail from Sacramento, CA. Despite numerous lineup changes over the years, founding member and main songwriter Jason Cooper (bass/vocals) has remained a constant fixture. Signing with the independent (and now defunct) Dr. Dream label shortly after Welt's formation, a series of singles were issued, as well as the full-lengths Better Days in 1995, Kicked in the Teeth in 1996, and Broke Down in 1998, during which time the band relocated to Orange County, CA. By the late '90s, Welt's permanent lineup became solidified, consisting of the ever-present Cooper, guitarists Tobe Bean and Todd Harper, plus drummer Marc Harrismendy. 2001 saw Welt's first release for the Better Youth Record Co., Brand New Dream. 

Welt was also a prelimenary name for a solo project by skinny puppy frontman nivek ogre. The project was swiftly renamed ohgr, but the debut album was named Welt. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/WELT">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
