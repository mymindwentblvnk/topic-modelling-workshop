88rising (stylized as 88â¬†), formerly known as CXSHXNLY, is an American mass media company that founder Sean Miyashiro describes as a "hybrid management, record label, video production and marketing company". The company has gained popularity as a musical platform and label for Asian artists such as Rich Brian (formerly known as Rich Chigga), Joji, Niki, and Higher Brothers. Miyashiro said that the record label is "not a core part of our business, but it's part of it" and that they are "really a media/video content focused company at heart".  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/88Rising">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
