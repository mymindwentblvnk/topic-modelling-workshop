There are multiple artists named Ov:

1) Ov marks the first duo recording collaboration between longtime collaborators and partners Christine Boepple (Whysp, Softwar, The Franciscan Hobbies, The Skygreen Leopards Skyband, Kyrgyz) and Jewelled Antler's Loren Chasse (Thuja, The Child Readers, The Franciscan Hobbies, Softwar, The Blithe Sons, Coelacanth), both from San Francisco, California, United States.
Building off of Chasse’s recent solo recordings as Of, the duo’s Ov project features loop-based compositions that incorporate strummed strings and otherworldly sounds.  The atmosphere achieved is dense and the compositions mesmorizing, recalling Marcus Popp at his most transcendental.

2) Ov is a duo of bass and drums playing raw blackened punk and hailing from Jacksonville, Florida, United States. The first demo, "Pleasure", was released by Primal Vomit Records in 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ov">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
