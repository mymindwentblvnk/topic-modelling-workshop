The Aperture Science Psychoacoustics Laboratory is the moniker of Mike Morasky, a composer for Valve. The laboratory is part of the Aperture Science Laboratory, researching psychoacoustics to enhance the immersive and multidimensional experience generated by Valve's most widely lauded game, Portal and its successor Portal 2.

According to Aperture, "Whether you’re a mega-science corporation with decades of test experience, or a young start-up liberating your first test subject from non-testing with a chloroform-soaked rag, Aperture guarantees results. Wake up your test subject, open the chamber door, and press play—let Aperture’s patent-pending rhythmic compliance enhancers do the rest."
