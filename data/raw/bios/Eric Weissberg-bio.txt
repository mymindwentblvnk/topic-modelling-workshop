Eric Weissberg (August 16, 1939 â€“ March 22, 2020) was an American singer, banjo player, and multi-instrumentalist, best known for playing solo in "Dueling Banjos," featured as the theme of the 1973 film Deliverance and released as a single that reached number 2 in the United States and Canada in 1973.

Weissberg attended the University of Wisconsin, then the Juilliard School of Music. He joined an early version of the Greenbriar Boys (1958-59), but left before they made any recordings. He then joined The Tarriers, replacing Eric Darling. The Tarriers had recently had a hit with "Banana Boat Song", though Harry Belafonte had the bigger hit soon afterwards. The group soon made use of his multi-instrumental talents as banjo player, guitarist, mandolin player and singer. At that time he was still a student at Juilliard. His first album with The Tarriers, Tell The World About This (1960) has a much more rustic feel than the smoother produced sound of The Weavers or The Kingston Trio. In 1964 he had to do one year of duty with the National Guard, but on returning, the group re-formed. In 1965 the group accompanied Judy Collins on a tour of Poland and Russia, but split up soon after. Judy Collins was  impressed to use him as a session musician on Fifth Album (1965) and several later albums.

Playing on albums by Doc Watson, Melanie, Billy Joel, Bob Dylan, Loudon Wainwright III, Talking Heads, Tom Paxton, Jim Croce, Art Garfunkel, John Denver and others. He is most famously known for the hit single "Dueling Banjos", the theme from the film Deliverance, produced by Joe Boyd and directed by John Boorman. There was also a hit album named Dueling Banjos: From the Original Movie Soundtrack 'Deliverance' in 1973, but the album was not all it seemed to be. Back in 1963, Weissberg had recorded an album named New Dimensions in Banjo and Bluegrass with Marshall Brickman. The 1963 album was hauled out of the archives, and two tracks were removed. They where replaced with the hit single, and thus a new album was born. One of the original tracks, "Shuckin' The Corn" was later sampled by The Beastie Boys. 

Continuing to play folk festivals, Weissberg was nearly as well known on that circuit for his dobro guitar as for his bluegrass banjo playing. He also recorded with jazz musicians Herbie Mann and Bob James. In 1998, he joined Richard Thompson and dozens of other folk musicians on Nanci Griffith's album, Other Voices Too.

He often toured with Tom Paxton. They frequently played a variant of "Dueling Banjos" in the set, in addition to Paxton's material.
