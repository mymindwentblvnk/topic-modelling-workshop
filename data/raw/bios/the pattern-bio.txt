Oakland Ca based rock band that recorded for Lookout in the late early millennium prior to frontman Christopher Appelgren driving the venerable indie label into bankruptcy. Other member's included guitarists Andy Asp ( formerly of Nuisance), Jason Rosenberg (formerly of Saint James Infirmary) , bassist Carson Bell (formerly of the Cuts), and drummer Nastic Anderson (formerly of Black Fork).

One example of the nepotism and fiscal excesses driving Lookout's bankruptcy was hiring "Andre The Giant Has A Posse / Obey" artist Shepard Fairey to direct the band's debut video, using royalties generated by Op Ivy and Green Day back catalog sales. The band also flew itself out to the UK to appear at The Reading Festival, but despite touring with many high profile acts, failed to gain any commercial traction before finally dissolving in 2004.
