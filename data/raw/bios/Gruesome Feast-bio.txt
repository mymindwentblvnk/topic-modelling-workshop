Gruesome Feast was an old-school brutal death metal band from Summerside, Prince Edward Island, Canada that was formed in 2003. As per the information in Metal Archives, they recorded a full-length album namely Gorchestral Blasphemy in 2004 but never released the album because of the band members being unhappy with the overall production on the album. The album has a very Immolation-esque old-school feel and atmosphere.

Their overall discography as given in Metal Archives is :
The First Supper  (Demo, 2003)
Gorchestral Blasphemy  (Full-length, 2006)
Gruesome History  (Video/VHS, 2009)
