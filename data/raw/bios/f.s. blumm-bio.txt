F.S. Blumm is a pseudonym of Frank Sch√ºltge (b. 1968, Bremen, Germany), who lives and works in Berlin, as a musician and a producer for radio-plays.

He has previously released albums with Cologne's Staubgold, Tomlab, and Berlin's Morr Music, and Lichten on Audio Dregs for his first stateside release. Besides his contributions to the Sack & Blumm project (together with Harald Sack Ziegler) he is involved in the production of radioplays with Rininat Rebresch ("Rebresch & Blumm") and with an instrumental chamber-postrock trio from Berlin called kinn. Though his music often finds a welcome ear with adventurous electronic listeners his songs are spun entirely with live instruments in real-time. The sound is naturalistic and free in a way that often leaves people hard pressed to find modern comparisons.
