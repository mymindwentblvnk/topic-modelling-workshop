BEAST CONJURATOR (Ancient Death Metal) - Recife/PE - Brazil
 -- Four Cultists of Cthulhu in service of the Unholy Metal of Death! -- 

2009 - Now

Beast Conjurator’s musickal purpose is always to play Death Metal in its most primitive and rough root. Element which combined with a bewitching and energetic Speed Metal sensibility, works on the Qliphotic Plains to create an obscure, sick and morbid black aura.

The lyrics follow the musical vein and focuses in themes like: occultism, mysticism, left hand paths, Cthulhu Mythos, lovecraftian works, smic horror and ancient mythology.

The coven influences are vast and numerous. Some of the main entities and masters can be recognized by names as: H.P. Lovecraft, Aleister Crowley, and Clark Ashton Smith. Almighty Hellhammer and Possessed, as well as Poison (Ger), Massacre, Pestilence, Mortuary Drape and Exorcist.
