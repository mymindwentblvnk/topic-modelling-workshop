Orange Can was formed in 1999 by brothers James and Jason Aslett in London, UK. Their first record Entrance High Rise was recorded in their home studio and released by independent label Regal.

After signing the brothers recruited bassist Lee Catlin and a drummer, who would later be replaced by Rory Clarke.

The quartet recorded The Engine House, and EP that was released just prior to Entrance High Rise. Both the album and EP enjoyed positive comparisons to the Stone Roses and early Pink Floyd, showing strength in atmospherics without dipping into pretense.

After four years of inactivity, the band will release a new album, Exit Chasing in the Summer of 2007.

The album comes out after a lengthy hiatus in which they "negotiated disaster and heartache, overcoming a serious back injury and a battle against prescription drugs." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Orange+Can">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
