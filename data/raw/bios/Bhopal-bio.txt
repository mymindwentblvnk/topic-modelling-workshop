BHOPAL is a blackened crust band from Piemonte (Northern Italy) with members or ex members of many HARDCORE bands (Jilted, Insult, Drunkards, Eyeless, PDM...), BLACK METAL bands (Mortuary Drape, Enthroning Silence, Dead and Forgotten) and DEATH METAL bands (Eroded).

BHOPAL was formed during the fall of 2004 in Alessandria(north/west of Italy) by 5 old friends, members of many hardcore punk bands of the town(as JILTED, INSULT, EYELESS, EXECUCAO, PDM, BIGOZ, DRUNKARDS...). During 2006 Paz(guitar) decided to leave the band. In few days Gianoz, old friend, joined the band. After a few shows, Bhopal recorded the first EP "Where Morality Fails": 3 songs for 11 minutes. During autumn 2007, Gianoz was replaced by Nicola(Mortuary Drape, Eroded, Enthorning Silence).
Bhopal recorded 7 new tracks during the summer of 2009 released by Shove records on LP in 2010 with the old 3 remastered tracks as bonus tracks. The LP is called AGE OF DARKNESS.
