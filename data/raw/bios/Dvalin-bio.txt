Vision and tradition unite to bring new life into the world. That‘s how in 2010 Dvalin
were born in the Southern German town of Würzburg – an auspicious alliance of
various influences, named after one of the legendary dwarves in Norse mythology
but rather resembling a slumbering giant whose imminent awakening is going to
make the metal scene shake in the most massive tremor it has felt in years! Seven
passionate souls, expressing their love for traditionally played pagan metal with
virtuosity, weaving it together with brutal melodic death- and black metal while visionarily incorporating
progressive elements, breaking new ground and expanding the genre‘s
boundaries. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dvalin">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
