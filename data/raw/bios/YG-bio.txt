Keenon Daequan Ray Jackson (born March 9, 1990), is an American rapper better known by the stage name YG (an initialism for Young Gangsta). In 2009, he released his debut single, "Toot It and Boot It", featuring Ty Dolla Sign, which peaked at number 67 on the Billboard Hot 100.[1] The single's success resulted in him signing to Def Jam Recordings.[2] In the following years, YG released various mixtapes such as The Real 4Fingaz and Just Re'd Up 2 among others.

In June 2013, YG signed to Young Jeezy's CTE World. His 2013 single "My Nigga" featuring Jeezy and Rich Homie Quan has peaked at number 19 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming the highest charting song of his career. He then released the singles "Left, Right" and "Who Do You Love?" featuring Drake leading up to the release of his debut studio album. His debut album, My Krazy Life was released on March 18, 2014, by Pu$haz Ink, CTE World and Def Jam.

YG came up with the idea for Pu$haz Ink in September 2008 with friends Ace and PC. He later officially co-founded the record label with DJ Mustard.[20] Originally the "label" was used as a promotional tool and a brand for YG and DJ Mustard's group of rap collaborators they had grown up with. Then as YG, Ty Dolla Sign and DJ Mustard grew in popularity, they decided to officially form a record label for Pushaz Ink, including rappers RJ, Reem Riches, Tee Cee, and Slim 400. In June 2014 YG signed music producer Kidd Cole sources say.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/YG">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
