Coldair is the work of a multi-instrumentalist Tobiasz Biliński, currently considered one of the most talented independent artists in Poland. Coldair is Bilinski’s solo effort - he writes music and lyrics, arranges and produces most of it by himself. His one-man-shows fuse the experimental-folk background with newly-developed love for modern electronic and pop music.

Starting out as a founder and drummer of the experimental band Kyst (which released 2 critically acclaimed albums and performed at such festivals as SXSW, Primavera Sound & Eurosonic), Biliński later decided to let his love for weird pop music take control. What came out of the experimental background and the exploration of song concept was his solo project Coldair. 

He self-released "Persephone", a collection of home-recorded, semi-demo songs in September 2010 and toured Poland and Europe extensively while promoting the release. Coldair’s first official album, "Far South", was released by a Polish indie-label Antena Krzyku in October 2011. Increasing popularity in his niche and critical acclaim led Biliński to national radio and television appearances, as well as performances at renowned festivals like SXSW in Austin, TX, Culture Collide in Los Angeles, CA, Open’er Festival in Gdynia, OFF Festival in Katowice, Canadian Music Week in Toronto, ON and more. In September 2013 he released his latest album called "Whose Blood". Shortly after, he surprised his fans by recording a cover of Justin Timberlake’s hit song “Strawberry Bubblegum”.

At the moment Coldair is working on a new record, which he will record in August. US & EU tours are scheduled for Autumn. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Coldair">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
