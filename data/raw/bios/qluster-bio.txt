Qluster is a new formation to follow Cluster. Its two main members Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Onnen Bock will continue to work under the concept of improvised music with electro-acoustic sound sources that in 1969 Conrad Schnitzler started to realise as Kluster in a Trio along with Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius. Qluster will perform with visuals of luma.launisch. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Qluster">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
