Today was formed in 1988 as Motown's attempt at promoting a new Four Tops. The group comprised Frederick Lee "Big Bub" Drakeford, Larry Singletary, Wesley Adams, and Larry McCain, childhood friends from Englewood, New Jersey.

The group started in 1984 as The Gents and comprised Drakeford, McCain, William McNeir, Ronald Scruggs, and Bernard Belle. During an anti-drug benefit, the group received a meeting with the producer Teddy Riley who renamed the group Today and melded them into the current lineup. Riley helped them receive a deal with MCA Records.

As the head of MCA records urban department, Jheryl Busby, moved into Motown, he brought several acts with him, including Today, The Boys and The Good Girls. While touring the country, the groups were highly successful.

When Today released their self-titled debut album in 1988, things started off looking pretty good. The single "Him Or Me" reached #3 on the R&B charts and was followed by "Girl I Got My Eyes On You" which reached #1. Yet the album's later singles did not do as well as their early showings, and they began to resent the way they were being produced and promoted.

Riley did not help the group with their second album, The New Formula, and it showed. Released in 1991, the album had one hit single, "Why You Get Funky on Me", which reached #2 on the R&B charts.

After the group broke up, Drakeford started a solo career while Singletary, Adams, and McCain wrote songs and tried to get a deal as a trio.

In October 2004 I Got The Feeling appeared in the popular videogame Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, playing on radio station CSR 103.9.
