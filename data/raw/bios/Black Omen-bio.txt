Black Omen is a black metal band from Eskişehir/Turkey

•  Originally formed in the year 2000 in Eskişehir by current guitar player Baran. 
•  While Baran was dealing with the production of songs, Serkan (bass) and Gökhan (vocals) joined the band. 
•  After the formation of musician line up, the band recorded a demo in 2003 that includes the compositions until that time. A limited number of copies was distributed to many magazines and radio broadcasts in Turkey. Finally, Black Omen had a good press from the audience and demo
•  In April of 2004, the band entered to the Midas'ın Kulaklığı Studios in Ankara for the records of the debut album, "When Pure Darkness Covers False World of Light". During the record session, keyboards were played by Kadir Yavuz. Mixing and mastering of the 10 tracks were assumed by Erkan Tatoğlu and Cüneyt Cağlayan. 
•  There were permanent line-up troubles particularly on drums and keyboard since the band founded. Fortunately, the band compensated with the addition of Onur (drums) in 2004. After the addition of Onur, they continued live performances later on the recording session. 
•  The debut album that is entitled "When Pure Darkness Covers False World of Light" was released in May of 2005 by Poem Productions that is a Turkish record company. Tracklist of the first album

•  Black Omen comes to head-to-head comparisions with the major acts of the genre, such as Dimmu Borgir, Graveworm, Agathodaimon, etc. The basic sound of the band is filled with deep and intense use of keyboards as of the Scadinavian forefathers of atmospheric and melodic black metal. 
•  In lyrics, the band deals with everything about humanity, decadent human relationships, melancholy and misanthrophy with a perspective based upon gothic and natural fancies and revolt towards the world that is symbolized by the light which they deeply abhor. 
•  The band played in many gigs and festivals in Turkey. On 22nd October 2005, Black Omen played as the local support of Swedish black metal legend "Marduk" in İzmir Rock Festival, on their Turkey tour. 
•  On 4th February 2006, the band again entered to the studio for the records of their second full-length album that is entitled "Sinphony". This time the band has arranged 13 dark and melodic songs for their audience. Mixing-mastering processes of these songs were completed by Erkan Tatoğlu and Cedric Teubl in Midas'ın Kulaklığı Studios within the same month. In the meantime, the band had broken with Kadir Yavuz since he started to work and could not have enough time as a musician. 
•  Recent line up of the band has formed after Tolga (keyboard) joined in 2006 summer. This addition also brought Black Omen to a new level of aggressivity and intensivity.
