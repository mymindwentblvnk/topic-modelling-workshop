The German metal band Cast in Silence from the Harz Mountains was founded in May 2006 by ex-Dark at Dawn drummer/guitarist Torsten Sauerbrey.
They serve modern metal with a pinch of melancholy and a peppery portion of hit suspicion.

After jamming a while with Stefan Cabanus on drums (ex-The Atmosfear) a unique singer (Michael Lowin, ex-Dark at Dawn-bassist) and a bassist full of rock´n´roll (Mario Thiel, ex-Buttercup) joined the band and completed the line-up. They played several shows in Germany including the Rockharz Open Air with bands like Gamma Ray, Subway to Sally, Paul Di´Anno and so on.

In October 2006, the band won the first "battle of the bands" judged by a jury of the music business consisting of people from Rock Hard, Metal Hammer, Drakkar etc. More than 100 bands applied to this contest.

In January/February 2007, the band recorded their debut album called "First". The reactions from the press so far were overwhelming. So they finally decided to found their own label called "EMPTY RIVER RECORDS" which released the album on 7th of July 2007.

Just after the release of the album drummer Stefan Cabanus left the band due to personal reasons and was replaced by Niklas Kahl. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cast+in+Silence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
