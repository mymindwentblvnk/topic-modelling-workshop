Chicago's Lesser Birds of Paradise formed in the winter of 1998 around the beautifully sparse acoustic songs of singer-songwriter Mark Janka. There are four main guys now: Mark Janka as Mark Janka, Tim Joyce as The Wizard, Greg Thomas as "Drummer," and Ben Schulman as The New Guy.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Lesser+Birds+of+Paradise">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
