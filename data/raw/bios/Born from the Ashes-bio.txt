"Making their live debut in November 2007 in front of a large crowd at Brisbane's Step Inn, Born From The Ashes have moved from strength to strength. Their unique combination of melody, technicality, dynamics and aggression continues to impress Brisbane audiences. BFTA have played shows such as The Black Crusade: Machinehead/Trivium/Arch Enemy tour. Pre PArty and The Soundwave Festival Afterparty." - From their MySpace
