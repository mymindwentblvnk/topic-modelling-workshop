There are several bands with the name Red Moon:

(1)The recently most popular artist with the name Red Moon is Norwegian-Swiss singer Joanna Deborah Bussinger, also known as Debrah Scarlett. She won Melodi Grand Prix 2015 together with Kjetil Mørland with the awardwinning* dramatic ballad "A Monster Like Me", and came 8th in the Eurovision Song Contest later that year. 
*Mørland won the Marcel Bezençon Composer Award for A Monster Like Me, an annual award where all the composers of that year's songs get to vote for the best composition amoungst all the entries. 

(2) Red Moon is Eva and Katarina Thulin. We are sisters living i Gothenburg, Sweden. Our music combines simple and direct melodies with complex soundscapes. The musical expression and sound are key elements. All music is created, produced and mixed by us, but in rare cases we use other musicians. As for today, Red Moon is not a live band. Most of the music is created in the studio. Nevertheless, we are currently discussing ways of performing our music live. 

PS
The other Red Moon album on this site called "lucky" is not made by Red Moon, Gothenburg. 

(3) RED MOON is a percussive acoustic group delivering a new sound of music.

Based in Indianapolis, IN, RED MOON emerged on the scene in 2005 with original music and a passionate blend of musical sophistication.
