Marshmello wears a custom helmet for public appearances. His identity was unknown, but was confirmed to be Chris Comstock in late 2017 by Forbes.

Marshmello's stage name, an alternative spelling of "marshmallow", and his marshmallow mascot head were both inspired by Canadian electro house music producer and DJ deadmau5, who also notably uses an alternate spelling for his stage name and performs wearing a "dead mouse" mascot head. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Marshmello">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
