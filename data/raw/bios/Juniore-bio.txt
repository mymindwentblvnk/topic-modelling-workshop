The French band Juniore was formed by Anna Jean (daughter of French writer JMG Le Clézio), a singer who lent her voice to songs of Parisian electro acts like Jackson, Jérôme ''Tacteel” Echenoz and Bot'Ox. Juniore, in which Anna Jean is joined by four other female musicians, is something completely different: surf, psychedelica, sixties Yé-Yé pop and space age music are all blended together by producer Samy Osta (Rover, La Femme, Louis Chedid), while Anna Jean sings stories about being sleep deprived, restless or falling out of love. Anna's mysterious voice is reminiscent of 60s muses, think Nico meets Françoise Hardy.

Juniore's debut album Ouh Là Là was released in 2017, followed by the mini-album Magnifique in 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Juniore">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
