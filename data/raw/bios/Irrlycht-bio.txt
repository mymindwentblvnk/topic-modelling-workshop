In the year 2004, short time after the warriors of GEWEIH had split up, the time had come for a new formation to rise from the mist, called IRRLYCHT (German for ghost light). Isegrimm (vocals & wolfish screams) and Nordger (guitars) still felt the inner urge to produce mystical and misanthropic music.
