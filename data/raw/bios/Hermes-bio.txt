3) Hermes 

Hermes is a rock band formed in Brussels, Belgium. Their first album “Hear & Know” released in 2011, features 12 songs going from the easy listening “Hear & Know”, to the more aggressive “Experience”, the incredible “Sex”, and the rest who doesn't  really fit any category... 
But the album was meant to be listened as a whole, for it is a journey. The artists takes us through an harmonica liftoff, a piano storm, an orgy of guitar, the drums anchoring the rhythm in a debauchery of excellence. And before long, the album is finished. The journey has ended; it was short, intense, but mostly f***ing good. Sweet success, that's what it is.
