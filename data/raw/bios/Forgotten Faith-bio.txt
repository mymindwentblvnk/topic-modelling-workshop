The journey of Forgotten Faith began in 2007 through the creative efforts of Ed and Chris. Not happy with some of the current trends in music, they set out to do something different; something they hoped would stand out from the rest. After months of writing and recording, and numerous auditions, the band finally completed its lineup with the additions of a bassist, Adam, and a drummer, Rob.

The band has spent countless hours working on their material in preparation to hit the stage and share their music with the masses. In December of 2009, the band began recording a 3-song demo, which they plan to use to promote their music. As of yet, no release date has been set for this demo.
