Taken from their myspace music profile (http://www.myspace.com/FallenEmbersmusic):

Taking influences from Progressive Metal, Jazz, Classical and Ambience - We are forming our own mold of Metal that takes all four genres into account to create a passionate form of music that has solid structure, beauty and depth.

We have plans to release 3 albums. The first and main album will be alike the MP3s on this MySpace, including vocals, guitars, drums, bass and the occassional keyboard. The second album will be acoustic renditions of the same songs, in the same layout, but with heavy reverb, a lot more atmospherics and a slower tempo. The third album will be classical and symphonic renditions of the same songs, in the same layout and with a reduced tempo.
