Mad God is a doom metal band from Johannesburg, South Africa that blends the sounds of stoner and traditional doom together. 
Within our lyrics and music you will discover themes of horror, madness, drugs and inter-dimensional beings as we pay homage to the great horror writer H.P Lovecraft. We also draw on both famous and South African true crime stories for our  lyrical content.
If you like your music slow and heavy then check us out.
