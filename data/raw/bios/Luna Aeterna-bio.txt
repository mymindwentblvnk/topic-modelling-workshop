The history of Luna Aeterna began in July, 2001 when Mihail Kalmykov and Lia decided to play music together.  Later Alexandr Salnikov (guitars) joined them. The band's initial name, 'Fullmoon' was designed to express the mystical and romantic mood of their music and lyrics.

Their music is considered to be influenced by popular female fronted bands like Nightwish, Within Temptation and Epica. However, Luna Aeterna has less epic and symphonic elements, their music has its own features. Some of the song lyrics are written in Romanian. 

In 2003 Lia left the band. Olga Salihova became the new singer. At last they found a drummer, Denis “MoTLEY” Matujzo. The band released a single and an EP, and then was ready to release the first album. In autumn 2005 the band changed its name for 'Luna Aeterna' because a band called Fullmoon already existed.

In the beginning of 2007 the first album called 'Tajna' ("Mystery") was released. It was met with approval and the band became well-known. 
The new band vocalist, Alexandra Komarova, sang in the second part of russian metal opera project, The Elven Manuscript by Epidemia.
