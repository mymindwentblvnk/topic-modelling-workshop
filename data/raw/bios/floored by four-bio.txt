Floored By Four is the eponymous debut from mike watt's "New York project," a quartet of renowned musicians comprising Dougie Bowne on drums, guitarist Nels Cline, Yuka Honda on keys, and bass, spiel and compositions by watt. 

All of the Four are gifted musicians but more importantly original, idiosyncratic, and unpredictable musicians. Their playing is bursting with undeniable character and imagination. Each have extensive histories playing diverse types of music and the results of this collaboration defy categorization. Floored By Four shifts effortlessly and unexpectedly between dark and mysterious jazz, avant-punk, exotic otherworldly sounds, strutting Memphis soul… echoes of Sun Ra, Booker T, Bitches Brew, Can, Funkadelic, Sonic Youth, Beefheart, Xenakis… 

Their debut studio album was recorded by Matt Vertaray, then mixed by Dougie, Yuka and Matt at Bowne’s basement studio on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. Floored By Four is being released September 28, 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Floored+By+Four">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
