Heaving Mass is a three piece Heavy Metal band from Chicago (although heavy doesn't really describe them well enough, maybe a Heaving Metal band). They are comprised from member of other currently active chicago area bands.

Members:
Adam Norden (American Heritage)
Chris Avgerin (Blood of the Tyrant)
John Sheehan (Cunting Whoreliquor)

I as described the show to a friend last night:
"I'm at the Empty Bottle watching Heaving Mass, not so much watching but more witnesses the flesh being ripped from the skulls of those brave enough to stand in front from their pure raw power"

If you are ever lucky enough to get the chance to see them ... run don't walk.... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heaving+Mass">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
