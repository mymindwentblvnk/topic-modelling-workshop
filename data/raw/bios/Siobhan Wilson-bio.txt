Siobhan Wilson is a Scottish singer-songwriter from Glasgow.

Wilson's EP, Glorified Demons, was an independent release. It was recorded in the bedroom of Gordon Skene (Frightened Rabbit, The Moth and the Mirror), who produced and plays on the record. 

Wilson’s story begins in Scotland, whilst studying classical music at school by day and prying apart her father’s record collection by night. The likes of Joni Mitchell, John Martyn and Nina Simone informed her inquisitive young ears, and the likes of Regina Spektor and Madeline Peyroux inspired the music you can hear today. A well travelled and manifold artist, she has led a musical life in various places: In France, where she relinquished the classical world for a burgeoning interest in jazz, immersing herself in the music of Thelonious Monk and Ella Fitzgerald, and the United States, where she recorded her first record in the musically fertile ground of Woodstock. 

Subsequently basing herself in Glasgow where she has established herself an independent artist, Wilson continues to display and develop her craft before audiences throughout the country, whom the Scottish media described as “falling under her charm.” As well as supporting such established names as Friendly Fires, Benjamin Biolay and Ben E. King, Wilson has become a part of the flourishing Glasgow music scene as well as playing to audiences throughout the UK.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Siobhan+Wilson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
