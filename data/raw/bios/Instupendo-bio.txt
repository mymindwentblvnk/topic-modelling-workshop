Philadelphia electronic artist and producer Instupendo blends downtempo beats with dreamy ambient textures and gentle melodies. Beginning in his teens, Aidan Peterson shared his early experiments via SoundCloud, honing his material before introducing Instupendo to bigger commercial platforms in 2016. Beginning with the woozy and deeply mellow "Six Forty Seven," he issued a barrage of singles and the EP An Instupendo Collection by year's end. One track, "Beauty Unit," found wider digital-streaming exposure, opening the door for subsequent songs to earn spots on additional high-profile playlists. His 2017 EP, Friend of a Friend, featured collaborations with Benny Sings and Lontalius. Later that year he was asked to remix RAC's track "Unusual." Early 2018 brought the sunny "Boy" and the Teen Daze-assisted "Fleur," both of which appeared on his Faces I Know EP. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Instupendo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
