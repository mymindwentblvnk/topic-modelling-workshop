The Heir spawned this dirge for Sophia therein late 2005. 

Currently based on a progressive musical approach, the project engages in their allegoric poetry an insight relatively on various issues concerning the collective unconsciousness – the cosmos we share. 

As a musical group in 2007, Darkside of Innocence commenced some studio activity by recording a demo entitled Bloody Mistress, only to be listened via myspace. 

In 2009 after 4 years since its beginning, the project records its first full length entitled “Infernum Liberus EST” with the participation of Dmitry Rishko – Dominia’s violinist. Later in 2010, Darkside of Innocence inked a record deal with the “Grailight Productions”, to release Infernum Liberus EST. 

As for 2011, the heirs started composing their second full length titled Xenogenesis and Cerberus – a single taken from it - is released throughout the net. The artistic evolution of the band also led Pedro Remiz to create a philosophical movement entitled "Sophia's Heirs" which aims to address through all kinds of art, some cultural biases that affect the human social relations. 

Nowadays as one man band since its members decided to part ways with the project to focus on their personal issues, Darkside of Innocence signs a record deal with "Infektion Records" to release Xenogenesis - the second full-lenght - due to be released on january the 10th, 2012.
