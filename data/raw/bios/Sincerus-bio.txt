Composer/songwriter Methilde Bouma decided to pick up a guitar in march 2007. Loving to write music but wanting to use a real guitar instead of a sampled one. After fondling and practicing around a bit, a number of songs began to emerge and thus it was time to record them. Armed with a Line 6 pocket pod, a microphone, Ibanez RG 7420, vocals, Sibelius 4 and Cubase SX it seems like the songs had become a bit more listenable. 

It was all fun and games until - like in every life - things began to get tough. (winter 2008) There was a lot of anger and frustration and henceforth the songs, audible mirrors of the darkened mind, began to adopt a more obscure, vicious character. A character less likely to symphonic metal, but more towards the deathmetal direction. The feelings proved to be a great inspiration for the six songs that are featured on "Conspire" They are honest, straightforward and definitely brutal: an accurate translation of the feelings one has at times like that. Something everyone can relate to at some point, and if not, it's still kickass music! 

Tom de Wit's versatile voice proved to be the perfect fit and so he became the vocalist of the band. On the side, melody is still occurring in the music and there are influences of many musical styles involved: classical, world music and industrial. This is made possible by Ruben Wijga (Sephyros, Insomnia), who does magic works with keys and orchestration on Katharsis. Sander Gommans (HDK, After Forever) will make an awesome guitar solo on Karma! 

Listeners of Sincerus have made comparisons with bands like Machine Head, Arch Enemy, Gojira, Soilwork, Bloodbath, Arcturus and Zyklon.
