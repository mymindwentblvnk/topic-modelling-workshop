Malpraxis is a a Romanian Death Metal band.

Malpraxis was formed in September 2009 at the initiative of Cristi (ex Skullp - vocals) and Florin (Necroville - drums) when they decided to form a Brutal Death Metal band fated to enforce the autochtonous scene, quite impercipient at the time. Shortly after, the Malpraxis concept started evolving through the co-operation of the young and talented guitarist  Vali (Raven of Darkness - guitarist), who immediately accepts the idea of bringing his contribution to what is meant to be a legion of Death Metal maniacs. The challange was also accepted by second guitarist Dan (ex Skullp - guitars) and bass player Ionut (Loudrage, ex Suffer, ex R.I.P) both have vast experience in the extreme metal area. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malpraxis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
