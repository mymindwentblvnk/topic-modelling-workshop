Titans Eve came together when brothers Brian (guitar/vocals) and Kyle Gamblin (guitar/backup vocals) decided to start their own musical project in 2008 after the departure of previous projects. The line up of Titans Eve was completed with the recruitment of Jesse Hord (bass) and Casey Ory (drums), from there the Vancouver-based band have set out to create honest, powerful modern metal and have repeatedly piled into the “Titan Train” (i.e. their 2007 Ford E-350 van) and traveled across Canada, bringing their music to as great an audience as possible. They’ve played over 80 shows in the past year and a half and shared the stage with, Ensiferum, Fintroll, Holy Grail and Exodus to name a few.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Titans+Eve">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
