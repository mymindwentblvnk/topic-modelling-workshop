The best beers and metal bands are unfiltered. The thing is neither is immediately palatable; complex alcohol and music require patience. Robust, nuanced tastes espouse flakes of sediment and yeast—elements that appear out of place, but are essential for greatness. Fayetteville, Arkansas’ Queen Beast is the paradigmatic musical example. The quintet’s eclectic punk and sludge is peppered with spurts of blast beats, hammer-ons, and audio samples. It’s jarring on first listen. It’s jarring on second listen too. Every time a groove begins to lock in, Queen Beast taps the clutch and shifts gears. It’s an endless Monty Python episode ('and now for something completely different'). The vocals range from low whispers to all manner of rasps and screams, heralding all things sex, drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll.  There seems to be a fair amount of politics and doom and gloom thrown in as well. Songs like 'It’s Okay if You Don’t Like It' transition seamlessly from death metal to Southern fried riff rock and back again over the course of ten and half minutes. Equally epic tracks include oases of psychedelic guitar solos, moody samples from movies, comedians, and speeches, and even an occasional smooth saxophone line. It’s best to hear them in context; the end result is a complex tapestry that’s more intricate than individual threads. The most straightforward number is 'The Fires of Judgment Will Cleanse Creation,' a twelve and a half minute oozing monolith. These guys just may be the second coming of Buzzov.en—be prepared for your face to be melted off. Sit back, have a beer, and take the time to appreciate Queen Beast’s visionary sludge. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Queen+Beast">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
