AMNISTIA stands for facets of dark, electronic dancemusic without a main focus on trends in the clubscene. Kickdrums, hard basslines, snaresounds, discreet but striking placed samples and a charismatic voice are the attributes of their sound. The lyrics are reflections of typical facets of human existence. Anger, hate, love and disruption - life itself in a word.

AMNISTIA was founded in 2003 in Leipzig (Germany) by Stefan Schoetz and Tino Claus, forced by the wish to create music with its own style and without dogmas. Since that day the band pushes forward irresistible. After many shows and the release of a couple of CD-R's during the last years they got well-known in the scene. In August 2006 they signed a deal with SCANNER. The first cooperation was the release of their album "Neophyte". Now their 2nd longplayer "Blackguard" is out and AMNISTIA will play whereever they wanted to play to promote the album and those who got the chance in the past to see AMNISTIA on stage, know that it is going to be hot.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amnistia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
