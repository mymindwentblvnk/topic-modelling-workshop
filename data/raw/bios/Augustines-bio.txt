Following the break-up of their former band Pela, front-man and guitarist Billy McCarthy and multi-instrumentalist Eric Sanderson decided to continue producing the songs that were originally supposed to comprise Pela's second studio album. Sanderson and McCarthy teamed up with former Pela bandmates Tomislav Zovich and Nate Martinez to record 'Rise Ye Sunken Ships' digitally under the name We Are Augustines on June 6th, 2011, and later physically on August 23rd, 2011. Rob Allen was added to the lineup after the recording of the album.

They later changed their name before the release of their eponymous second album, Augustines, which was released on February 3rd, 2014.

Their third album, This Is Your Life, was released on June 10th, 2016.

They announced they were splitting up in September 2016 and played their last show at the Liverpool Academy  in England on the 31st of October 2016. The show was broadcast by Facebook Live.

Their story has been documented in Todd Howe's movie ''RISE'', set to be released in 2017.
