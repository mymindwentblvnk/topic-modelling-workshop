It shows everybody what kind of band this is... Dark, emotional, gothic, romantic music from the bottoms of the heart. On live live apperences, a guy called Grim sat behind the drumset. The reason was that Paul suffered of agoraphobia. The full-length album, simply entitled "Darklands" was released 1998. After recording the album both Paul and Grim left the band and were replaced by Jonas Wisén. Musically Darklands is a cross between Type O´Negative, The Doors & Danzig. 
months the band split up and this could have been the end of the Darklands story. The band reunited in autumn 1993 with a new drummer named Mårten Mangefors. Two songs were recorded for the compilation cassette "Sundsvall Underground" in April 1994. The very same year the demotape "Diablerie" was released and it was highly praised in various zines, and of course by all the rockers in the bands hometown, Sundsvall. Another demo tape was actually recorded in 1995, but it was never released, due to the fact that Darklands got signed to the, at the time, young & fresh record.
