Disfiguring the Goddess is a one-man slam death metal band created by Cameron Argon (aka Big Chocolate) in Minden, USA in 2006.  As its sole member, Argon performs all vocals, guitars, electronics, and programmed drums. Several demos were released digitally between 2007 and 2009 before the official debut with the album Circle of Nine, released through iTunes on March 31, 2011. The following year, Sleeper was released. This was the band's first physical release as CDs were pressed, and a limited quantity of CDs contained a bonus disc with instrumentals as well as three hidden bonus tracks.

On December 10, 2013, Disfiguring the Goddess released two albums simultaneously: Deprive and Black Earth Child. Cameron Argon announced Deprive as the next DTG album, but secretly worked on Black Earth Child and released it on the same day as Deprive without any prior notice. CDs were pressed for both albums, all containing the instrumentals as a bonus disc.

Disfiguring the Goddess hasn't released anything since 2013; Argon has been focusing more on Big Chocolate. However, he has since created a closed Facebook group for DTG, in which he has mentioned working on at least two new albums. As of January 2019, he plans to release one of the albums in the spring. He also created a Bandcamp page at https://disfiguringthegoddess.bandcamp.com, making Circle of Nine available losslessly for the first time (from his own WAV files that he was able to locate). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Disfiguring+the+Goddess">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
