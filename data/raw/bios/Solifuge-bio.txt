Solifuge was formed in Long Beach, New York, by Alex Shirzay, and Eric Plante. they set out to create a visceral aural assault by combining the metalcore and hardcore that Eric listened to with the vile drone, sludge, and technical grind that Shirzay worships, and then subtracting the cliches that plague the above. The result may well be the only decent high school metal band in America.
