Originally formed as the duo of Andrew Sallee and Chuck Whittington while living in Shawnee, OK, the band did not always have the name they have become known for. Initially, they recorded a series of tapes, a CD and compilation appearances as The Fauves, but changed their name after finding out about an Australian band using the same moniker, though pronounced differently. At this, they changed their name to Hipster Dufus, and shortly thereafter made the move to their current home of the Kansas City area. After finding influences in Guided by Voices and Sunny Day Real Estate, adding new member Jason Lewis, and deciding on yet another name change, they were well on their way to creating the folk and electronic-tinged indie pop you can hear from them to this day.
