In the year 2000, five guys from Bonn (NRW), Germany decided to start a metalband and call it Eat Unda Table. After recording and releasing the “dressed like beauty queens” EP in 2006, the “follow the asphalt” split EP in 2007, playing a lot of shows and sharing the stage with bands like Misery Speaks, Dew-Scented, Fear My Thoughts, Burning Skies, War from a Harlots Mouth, Callejón, Machinemade God, Narziss, Fire in the Attic just to name a few, they started writing new material in 2008.

While creating new songs the boys realised that the current name - Eat Unda Table - wouldn't fit any longer to their new Melodic-Death-Metal Sound. The former name emerged from a totally different period in their band's history. A history these guys are very proud of. Every single achievement made in the past will not die with the change of the name.

After a couple of months the boys decided to pick “We Are Wolf “ as their new bandname, moving on with a new style of music and bringing it all to a higher level. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eat+Unda+Table">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
