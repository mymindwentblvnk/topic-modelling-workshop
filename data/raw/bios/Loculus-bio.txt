LOCULUS was founded in June of 2007 by Northern Virginia guitarist Steve Miller with one goal in mind: to create unadulterated, psychotic, skull crushing death metal! The music of Loculus is focused not only on being technical and brutal but on doing so without sacrificing the hooks and the killer riffs which fans of all kinds of metal crave.
