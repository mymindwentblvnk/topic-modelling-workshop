Put together in 2006, Auaesuve is an American music band that plays Ambient and Funeral Doom Metal. The band has changed musical styles a few times: The first demo is ambient, the first EP is drone/doom, the third demo is neofolk/doom metal and the first full-length is funeral doom metal. In 2006, Thomas Edwards was to help build ideas for unreleased material finished before "Deceased Earth" as an official member, but it never came to be. Since then, the musical paths of both Thomas and J. went in completely different directions with J. leaning towards dark ambient-styled doom metal and Thomas' leaning towards more pop and hardcore oriented music. 
J. has tried to remake the ideas of some of his more personal songs from time to time through the years in an attempt to mature them with newer experiences, for instance: the song "Everlasting and Lost" is a more personal take to the older idea/song "Funereal Passage into Dead Sea". Although Auaesuve was disbanded soon after creating the "Akashic Sands of the Past " demo (in favor of creating music under different names), the project was started back up in late 2009 with the motivation to try and create music that went side-by-side with the ideas that the project originally started in, along with newer ones.
