"OAK ROOTS" is a folk metal group created in Rome by Manuel Rodriguez and Michele Zampa in 2009. After a few changes the actual members are Luca Grimaldi, Emile Ammann, Evita Zaccaria, Piersante Falconi and Patrizio Tinelli. At the beginning the project was an epic viking metal, after a long discussion about the stile the group would adopt, they found that a fusion of folk/pagan/viking metal would fulfil their expectations. At the moment OAK ROOTS is looking forward to record their first demo in June 22nd. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oak+Roots">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
