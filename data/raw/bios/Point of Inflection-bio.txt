Point of Inflection is a quintet of deranged guys, who have something in common -> their fondness for for heavy stuff! Five guys, hundreds of bands, several points of view... You can deduce therefore that their own sound is influenced by the most different styles of heavy metal music (for example bands like "At the Gates", "The Black Dahlia Murder", "Mayhem", "between the buried and me", "The Red Chord", "Death", "Morbid Angel" etc....). The result is an absolutely independent and truthfully heavy sound. Point of Inflection was founded in August 2005. The first Demo was recorded in Januar 2006, at the Deimos Studios in VÃ¶lklingen. After that, the band was busy writing songs for the first live-performances. The first gig as one of the support-bands for "Machinemade God" was a true success, as were the following shows. At the Hell's Kitchen Festival, POI hammered some new songs into the audience - another successfull show, crowned with great performances of Epilogue, Neaera, Machinemade God and Fear my Thoughts <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Point+of+Inflection">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
