Max Graef is born and raised in Berlin; a prime example of the new generation of young producers emerging at the moment. His output is mature and well rounded, juggling everything from house, hip-hop & bass to indefinable hybrids of in-between.
His own label “Box Aus Holz” is fast becoming a hub for upcoming producers focussing on raw house & disco. Besides releasing on his own imprint, Max is signed to Tartelet Records, where his debut album will be released in spring 2014.

Furthermore Max has releases on Heist (Detroit Swindle), Melbourne Deepcast, Sleazy Beats and The Gym and will be featured on the upcoming DJ Kicks (!K7) mixed by Brandt Brauer Frick. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Max+Graef">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
