Formed in 1999, Dedicted is not a new name on the Belgian metal scene but the band was only signed in 2008 by Shiver Records, the label par excellence for promising bands on the Belgian underground scene. Dedicted has already released two demos under their own steam, but the band’s deal with Shiver Records and the debut album ‘Argonauts’ have definitely taken their career to the next level. The band combines a death/ thrash/ polyrythmic-based style with groovy guitars and aggressive melodies and they are ready to set off!! So keep your eyes open for Dedicted in 2009- The journey has just begun!
