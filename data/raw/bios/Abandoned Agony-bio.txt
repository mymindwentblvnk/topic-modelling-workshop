Abandoned Agony are a death metal band from Bangalore, India.

Abandoned Agony started out early in 2006, originally playing thrash metal. After a few gigs, the band found its true sound and soul in death metal. After a few line up changes, the genre that the band currently pursues is ‘brutal death metal’ which is characterised by guttural vocals, speed guitar riffing, technical solos, accompanied by equally fast n technical drumming. The band believes in staying true to what they believe in; making unadulterated music without having a commercial view, and delivering the same in power pact performances.

They have released their first demo titled Infected Unborn.
