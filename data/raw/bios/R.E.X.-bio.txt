This Finnish melodic death metal band called R.E.X. was found in spring 2007 by Janne Niinisaari and Mikko Junnola. At that time R.E.X. had two session members; Jan Lampikari (guitar) and Oskari Rönkkö (drums). In the end of summer 2007 Janne and Mikko recorded a demo called Reborn Craft and R.E.X. had a gig in Hamina at Bastioni Rock. Few months later Jan and Oskari joined the band as official members and in the beginning of 2008 R.E.X. recorded in RK13 Basement (recorded, mixed and mastered by Juha Lampikari) their first official demo with full line-up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/R.E.X.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
