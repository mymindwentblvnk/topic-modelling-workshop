Nadiwrath was formed in February of 2007, by Nadir (guitars) and Wrath (vocals)! Soon Sardonic (bass) and Skullblaster (drums) joined the band! With this specific line up, Nadiwrath started rehearsing their first songs. 

After a couple of months, Nadir and Wrath started facing some serious problems when Skullblaster announced that he couldn't continue with Nadiwrath. Without losing time, Yngve (drums) joined the band and soon the recordings of the first Nadiwrath demo was a reality! But the problems continued with Sardonic isolating himself in his own haven, away from all! So it was Nadir who recorded the bass, for the demands of the first Nadiwrath demo. 

Despite of these problems, Nadiwrath demo was recorded and finally released in August of 2007! Three songs in the vein of Darkthrone, Carpathian forest, Impaled Nazarene, was the result of this demo. Sardonic has also returned to this unholy horde once and for all and Nadiwrath continues spreading their black metal propaganda, against all! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nadiwrath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
