Melodic death metal band formed in 1992 in Pirkkala, Finland, In My Veins' material had a dark edge to it. The band released one official demo "The Red Sky at Dawn" in 1995 and some rehearsal tapes. They had sufficient amount of new songs for another demo but apparently the band split before that was recorded, probably already in late 1995 even though this information is unverified.

The line-up on the demo was:
Thorion - vocals
Toni (Honkanen) - guitars, (bass?)
Joni - guitars, (bass?)
Jabbe - drums
