"((Thorlock)) play a kind of Southbound stoner-doomly fuckyouupcore that only Bulletwolf do more drunkenly and Orange Goblin mastered on their last album, Healing through Fire." - StonerRock.com 

"Sound is heavy, sludgy, and catchy enough to no doubt garner ‘em a wider audience than, say, Eyehategod could’ve ever dreamed, even with two tunes clocking in on the ugly side of eighteen minutes." - Jimmy Alvarado (Razorcake) 

"Think Melvins, get stoned, think more Melvins." - Orlotan206.blogspot.com

This self-titled release is saturated with enough feel good vibes, (or is that THC) distortion and psychedeladroning to keep even the most hard edged Eyehategod/High On Fire fan enthralled." - E-Metalspace 

"the band showed again that they could hold their own in any scene, on any level" - Bannedpromotions.com
