TALIAN is born in 2006 from the ashes of previously named band TALIANDOROGD who released 1 album 'The parting' (2004) and a 5-tracks EP in 2001 'Neverplace'
The coming of Sebastian Le Bellec (ex-INDRAMA, BELEG EUS FALL), Romain Buisson and Stephane Nestiri (ETHERSENS, ex-ERADYKATE) helped to refund the band to provide a hot and direct music, influenced by major bands such as SPIRITUAL BEGGARS, OPETH or STRAPPING YOUNG LAD among others.
The beast is alive ! Writing new songs, working with famous producer Neb Xort (ANOREXIA NERVOSA, GTI, ULTRA VOMIT...) in Drudenhaus studio to record the new album 'Scraps from the mire' reveals the real potential of TALIAN's music.
This new Metal bombshell is definitively designed to be played live ! The huge sound and the sharp groove of 'Scraps from the mire' brings TALIAN on the very top edge of bands among which you will undoubtly have to count on ! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Talian">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
