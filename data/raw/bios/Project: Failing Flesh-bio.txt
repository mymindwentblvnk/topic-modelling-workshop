Project: Failing Flesh was formed by a pair of Virginian metalheads by the names of Tim Gutierrez (With Burning Contempt) and Kevin '131' Gutierrez, who play all the instruments, and who recruited ex-Voivod and current E-Force singer Eric Forrest to complete the line-up.

The first album, A Beautiful Sickness, released in 2004, could be described as a mixing of mid-paced thrash and industrial metal.

2007 sees the release of their second album, The Conjoined, where P:FF may be a bit more on the experimental side, while still retaining the sound of their first album.
