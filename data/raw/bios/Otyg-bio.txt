Otyg is a folk metal project of Vintersorg, formed in 1995, they hail from Sweden. They released three demos and two albums over 5 years of being active. 
Otyg was put to sleep as of 2002, as Andreas Hedlund, a.k.a. Vintersorg, and Mattias Marklund have lost interest and inspiration for the project. They might do a new recording eventually in the future if the time is right. In April 2012, Hedlund confirmed that Otyg had reformed and that an album may be released in 2013.
