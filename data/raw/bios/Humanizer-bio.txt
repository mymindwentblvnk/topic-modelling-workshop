1) Humanizer is the solo project of Paul Ressel, who is better known for his work as the composer for Cape-Town based group "Lark". Taking strands from 8 bit to baroque, his performances feature acoustic instruments such as harpsichords and guitar blended into crunchy tones from circuit-bent  game consoles, toys and obscure or vintage electronic instruments. His compositions are characteristically whimsical, unpredictable and lacking typical song structure.

2) Death Metal band from Costa Rica. They released a self-titled EP in 2012.
