WC and the Maad Circle was an American hip hop group from Los Angeles, California that consisted of WC, Chilly Chill, Big Gee, Sir Jinx, Coolio and DJ Crazy Toones.

MAAD stands for Minority Alliance of Anti-Discrimination. Following the dissolution of Low Profile, the rapper WC formed the group and released the albums, Ain't a Damn Thang Changed in 1991 and Curb Servin' in 1995. The albums spawned some popular singles, notably "Dress Code", "West Up!" and "The One".

WC would later leave the group and form the gangsta rap supergroup Westside Connection with Ice Cube and Mack 10. WC and Crazy Toones continued working together at Ice Cube's Lench Mob Records.

On January 9, 2017, Crazy Toones died at age 45 of a heart attack.
