Exises were a progressive/heavy metal band formed in Netherlands  (Zaandam/Purmerend, North Holland) in 1984. Their sound is somewhat similar to Queensryche, Racer X, M.A.R.S. or Leatherwolf. They released a series of demos and singles before releasing their first full-length "Exises" on Megaton in 1987. The band reformed in the 1990's to release "Reternity" - a progressive work focusing on astronomy. for more info on the band, including album reviews check out their page on http://www.metal-archives.com/ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Exises">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
