1) Japanese free psych/drone unit Tetragrammaton is one part 70s free improv (from the school of Kaoru Abe and Masayuki Takayanagi) and one part new millennium blissed-out drone/noise (a la Hototogisu and Vibracathedral Orchestra).
With a mix of hurdy-gurdy, soprano saxophone, drums, percussion and (tabletop) guitar, the instrumentation might be well-suited to the folk-music of Eastern Europe, but falls more decisively into the camp of Fushitsusha or Borbetomagus. Frequent guest spots have included Chie Mukai, Mitsuru Tabata (Acid Mother's Temple, Zeni Geva), Hiroshi Hasegawa (Astro, C.C.C.C.), Damo Suzuki (ex. Can) and butoh legend Mitsutaka Ishii.
The three members, TOMO, Cal Lyall, and Ken Nobunaga are also involved in a number of other projects, ranging from harsh noise to eclectic folk to electronica.
