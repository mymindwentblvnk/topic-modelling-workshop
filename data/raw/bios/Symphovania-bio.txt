Symphovania Started late in 2005 when Nina (ex-Vocalist), Hakam Abu Sauood (ex-Drummer) Joined Ala'a, Ahmad and George Jaenini (ex-Bassist). Symphovania members decided to play Epic Symphonic Power Metal since they all shared their crystal clear passion for Power Beats and fast tunes and to work hard to launch their musical career. Leaving the local scene aside for a while Symphovania had larger plans. They started working on their first album "A Knight Ride to Silencia" which contains operatic dark melodies and symphonic tunes with Epic influences.

Symphovania's first appearance was at Amman's First Charity Rock Festival when funds were raised to those who are less fortunate. Symphovania was able to pull off a great performance which many metal/rock fans admired. Symphovania also performed with other respected local bands such as Bilocate, Illusions and Atmosfear. Symphovania also performed at "Eeden Battle Of The Bands" and at "The Sims" in 2006. The gigs are now on hold because most of the bands are busy with their albums and release.

After several changes in the band, the band is confirmed with the suitable line-up Symphovania magic was looking for by the joining of Lucy Zakharia on Vocals, Costy Zakharia on Drums, George Durzi on Bass Guitars. The band is going under serious work and practice sessions to surprise the crowd with any next upcoming gig. And expecting the album to hit hard in the Jordanian Metal Scene.

Symphovania also promises that it's only the beginning. They will always work on materials that they have been writing for a couple of years now. Symphovania loves you all and appreciates your support.

All the songs in the album "Behind The Mirror" were composed by: Ahmad Ajjouri,George Durzi,Costy Zakharia and Lama Zakharia. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Symphovania">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
