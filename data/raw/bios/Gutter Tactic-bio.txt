Death Metal hailing from Sydney's Northern Beaches! 
Originally from the Northern Beaches, Gutter Tactic now have members spread throughout Sydney. they have been together writing and gigging across Australia for the last 5 years and have been turning heads and blowing ear drums with their brutality and energy. With the pleasure of having their name and interviews in magazines and newspapers such as HEAVY and The Manly Daily, Gutter Tactic has steadily carved their name into the Aussie metal scene.
With their self titled debut album released in 2013 and second album (Blood Desire) that was recorded in may of 2015 and awaiting release, these guy's are bringing an intense sound of death metal to Australia. Think Job for a Cowboy meets The Black Dahlia Murder and the result is GUTTER TACTIC!
