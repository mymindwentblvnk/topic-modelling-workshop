Welcome to the phenomenon that is Fury UK. Since signing to independent label Rocksector Records in 2007, Fury UK has emerged as one of the most exciting young classic metal bands Britain has to offer, with quality albums & remarkably uplifting live performances….

Metal Hammer (review of Hammerfest 2010) "it's always good to discover a new favourite band at festivals and Fury UK seem destined to fit that bill for plenty of people. Their stirring old-school metal sidesteps retro cliche and goes for the jugular with lashings of blistering lead work and planet-sized tunes"

Based in Manchester, Fury UK are inspired by the likes of Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Dream Theater, Joe Satriani, Black Sabbath, Metallica & Rush. The amazing reaction to live gigs is a measure of this band & all the more impressive for being delivered within the dynamics of a 3 piece :- Chris Appleton : lead vocals & lead guitar / Martin McNee : drums / Luke Appleton : bass guitar & backing vocals.

In 2007 Fury UK signed to Rocksector Records (distributed in UK & Europe via PlasticHead) & later that year the debut album "Face Of Adversity" was released. The EP "Salvation" quickly followed. This channelled the band's sound into the trademark that is now recognised as a force in British rock/metal. Fury UK’s 2nd full album entitled "VR" (July 2009) received excellent reviews & represented a “coming of age”, before their 3rd full release “A Way Of Life” in September 2010, together with the very successful UK tour with Y&T, catapulted the band to the kind of recognition its’ loyal supporters knew was imminent. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fury+UK">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
