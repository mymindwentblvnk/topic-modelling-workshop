Agoraphobic Nosebleed is a Grindcore band formed in 1994 in Massachusetts, United States. Its line-up has changed often during the years, leaving the only permanent member Scott Hull (guitars, drum programming), also a guitarist in Pig Destroyer, though vocalist Jay Randall has been a constant member since their debut album, Honky Reduction. The current line-up also includes vocalist Richard Johnson of Enemy Soil and Drugs of Faith, who also plays bass guitar. Agoraphobic Nosebleed are one of the most well-known drum-machine Grindcore bands, and have influenced many drum-machine Grindcore bands.  The band is known for the brevity of its songs. Their album Altered States of America features 100 songs (including one hidden) in just under 22 minutes, with many songs of 5 seconds or less, and the longest song only 1:45. They played their first live set at the 2003 New England Metal and Hardcore Punk Festival.
