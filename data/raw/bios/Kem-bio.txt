Kem Owens, professionally known as Kem, is an American R&B/soul singer, songwriter, and producer. He was born in Nashville, Tennessee and raised in Detroit, Michigan.

After finishing high school, Kem dealt with homelessness, addiction, and isolation from his family. He did not overcome these issues until he turned to spirituality and music, as he has said, "My career didn't take off until I connected with my spirituality. That's why I take time on stage and on the album to administer spirituality to people. That's one of the things that I am most proud of." He has also stated that he does not create music marketed to the mainstream hip-hop-dominated R&B crowd but to people who enjoy his soul/jazz adult contemporary sound and lyrical content. He wrote, produced, and financed his self-released debut album, Kemistry, by singing in a wedding band and waiting tables. He was later signed by Motown Records, who re-released the album on February 25, 2003. The album's first single, "Love Calls", became a hit at urban adult contemporary and smooth jazz radio. He followed his debut release with a sophomore album, Album II, released May 17, 2005. It included the hit single "I Can't Stop Loving You", a #1 at urban adult contemporary radio, and the song "You Might Win" featuring Stevie Wonder on harmonica. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kem">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
