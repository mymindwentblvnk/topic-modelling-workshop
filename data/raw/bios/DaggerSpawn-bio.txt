The inital assemblage of imaginations began in the year of 2005, and the vast course of events kept DAGGERSPAWN evolving into an abomination as seen today. Founding members Nenad Petrovic (guitar) Jovan Katic (guitar) and Vlada Mladenovic (drums). Danilo Trbojevic (vocals) was soon enrolled in their rows, and with the arrival of Srdjan Salamunovic (bass), the horrid pact was complete...

By this congregation their forbidden craft ravaged live on many shows, as well as local and abroad.. Several split releases and an unnoficial demo were spawned during the years of 2007-2008.. As well they were noted as a first ever band from Serbia that recorded their live show and published a live DVD "Wrecking Ferocity"...before the official full-lenght album...

DAGGERSPAWN entered the Archsound Aslym in the begining of 2008, and started laying first ghost tracks for their debut album... Unfortunately during this project, Vlada Mladenovic left the drummer position.. But after a few months of searching, Nikola Jankovic (Triumfall) reclaims this position, thus giving form to a yet sinister sound...

In the end of 2008 band signed for Sevared Records & Butchered Records, releasing the official full length album "Suffering Upon The Throne Of Depravity" upon fragile and yet unprepared world, featuring the fantastic cover made by ZIG (Suffocation, Dying Fetus, etc.) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daggerspawn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
