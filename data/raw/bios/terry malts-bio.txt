Terry Malts have refined their frothy pop into a perfect mix of crunch and catchiness. On "Tumble Down" the band takes pages from both the Dum Dum Girls and Surfer Blood camps and makes the combination sound perfectly natural. We've found it absolutely impossible to get their fizzy, bouncy riffs out of our heads and we think you might too. Definitely one to watch for 2012.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Terry+Malts">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
