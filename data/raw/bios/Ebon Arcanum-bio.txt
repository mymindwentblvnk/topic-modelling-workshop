Cortland Runyon out of Bloomington, Illinois, USA, is the sole master-mind of this project. Awakening, released on Senseless Life Records in 2014, is the debut album from Ebon Arcanum that defines the epic and unique sound of the atmospheric black metal solo project. For fans of Summoning, Woods of Desolation - Official, Aloeswood, and Swallow the Sun; Ebon Arcanum is heavily dependent on the use of keyboards, using distorted guitars only for backing rhythm tracks. Bordering on DSBM, the compositions are meant to conjure images within the listeners mind and take you on a journey through time, space, and human emotion.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ebon+Arcanum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
