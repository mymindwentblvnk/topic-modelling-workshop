daste. are a trio from the Gold Coast Australia who make chilled R&B/Soul music that can be likened to a mix between Tora, Parcels, Two Another and Leisure.

Braxton and Tyler became friends in high school and then met Callum at a “Popular Music” degree at Griffith University. They quickly developed a connection thorough similar tastes in music, and after performing with a local band called “ANNY” for a few months they started playing around with a few ideas amongst them, and this inevitably led to the formation of daste.

In late 2018 Callum, Tyler & Braxton finished recording their first daste-single ‘Thinkin Of’. They sent it over to Jez Ryan at Mammal Sounds who was just in the process of launching “Mammal Sounds Records” and thought that track was a perfect fit for what he was looking for. The reception to ‘Thinkin of’ exceeded all expectations and gave Callum, Tyler & Braxton the reassurance they needed to know they were indeed on the right path.

In 2019 daste. teamed up with Mammal Sounds Records for the release of their debut ep “Palette”, which featured their singles ‘Thinkin of’, ‘Myself’ and ‘SOBER”. Shortly after that they also partnered with Australian booking agency New World Artists and have since supported the likes of Lastlings, First Beige and Midnight Pool Party – they were also one of 16 artists selected by Triple J’s Dave Ruby Howe to perform at Sydney’s Electronic Music Conference (EMC) in December 2019.

They also began working on their second ep “Same As It Ever Was” which they released in early 2020 and it was met with much praise & appreciation from music curators, industry peers and fans across the globe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/daste.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
