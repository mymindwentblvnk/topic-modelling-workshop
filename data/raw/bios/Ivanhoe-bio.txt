IVANHOE is a band from Germany; their first release is dated 1992 ("Visions and Reality"); their style could be called metal-progressive, their works are full of feel and techniques, due to the ability of the members, which are all great and complete musicians.

The elements of prog-style are united with a metal-style; powerful metal riffs, great arpeggios, uses of keyboards, great instrumental parts... with a style which in part can be similar with metal progressive groups as ANGRA, QUEENSRYCHE, ELEGY, but with a personal style. Very particular is the great voice of Andy B. Franck, who is incredible with the high notes as well on the bass ones, really a good voice, quite similar to Geoff Tate in the high notes); his way of singing contributes to create a particular atmospheric, helped by the use of keyboards and by the arpeggios and solo of Schuler. The line up is essential the same in all their three albums, but in the last, "Polarized", the guitar passes from Schuler to Welsch; Welsch is too a great virtuoso, but probably this little change in the line-up can be heard by a little difference of style.

The best cd is probably their first "Visions and Reality" (I suggest you to buy it for first), also 'cause it has been a work particular, with a personal style different from other bands, there is a particular atmosphere in the album; their second album: "Symbols of Time" is also a great album, full of great songs; also the third album ("Polarized") is very good, but a little less than the others.
