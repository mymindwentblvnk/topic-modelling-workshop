MINCE GRINDCOE band  from Novokuznetsk (Russia). They started in 2005 and have recorded one Demo and 2 albums. Its musical style is clearly GRINDCORE with lyrics themes such as: social, politics, feelings, etc. Besides grindcore they have also little other musical influences such as: crust, power violence, hardcore and even punk (mainly remind the old band "Discharge"). Their last album "ordo mundi" has an excellent sound quality, a high technical level and is very well produced.
