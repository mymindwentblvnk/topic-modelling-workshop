The Good Girls (Shireen Crutchfield, Joyce Tolbert, and DeMonica Santiago) were recording artist for Motown Records, and were groomed as a contemporary version of The Supremes with a more urban sound. The group's debut album "All for Your Love," influenced heavily by Teddy Riley's "New Jack Swing" movement, was released 1989, producing the hit single Your Sweetness which peaked to #6 on Billboard's "Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles". Other notable single included Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart and I Need Your Love. The group's second album Just Call Me was released in 1992 with lukewarm success. Two highlights for the group happened in 1990 when they went on Motown's MotorTown Tour and later that year, they would join New Kids on the Block's No More Games tour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Good+Girls">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
