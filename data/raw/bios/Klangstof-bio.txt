The dreamy alt-indie of Amsterdam-based group Klangstof is the product of Norwegian singer/songwriter and producer Koen van de Wardt. His earliest inspiration was Radiohead's OK Computer, which he used to hone his instrument-playing skills. Once he started writing his own material, he bolstered his songcraft abilities with studies at Hedmark University College in Norway. After a stint as bassist with Dutch indie band Moss, van de Wardt committed himself to the Klangstof project in 2014. After releasing the single "Hostage" in 2016, he signed with Mind of a Genius, home to Zhu and Gallant. The sweeping tune incorporated the icy soundscapes favored by Radiohead in their late-era works, while also infusing some of the ethereal atmospherics of Sigur RÃ³s and funky flourishes of Alt-J into the mix. A full-length arrived in 2016. Close Eyes to Exit featured "Hostages" and the title track. It resulted in a remix collection, Klangstoff Remixes: Dusk, that was issued in 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Klangstof">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
