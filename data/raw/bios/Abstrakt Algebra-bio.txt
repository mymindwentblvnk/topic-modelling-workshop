Abstrakt Algebra was a Swedish experimental metal band with influences from power metal and doom metal that was founded in 1995 by Leif Edling after the band Candlemass fell apart.

They made one album, but Edling had already started working on a second album with a different line-up. However, due to the commercial failure of Abstrakt Algebra, Edling reformed Candlemass while taking with him some of the ideas for that second album, as well as drummer Jejo Perkovic. There, materialised on the Dactylis Glomerata album. And as such Abstrakt Algebra was over.

Mats Lev√©n later appeared as the singer of the band Krux, another band by Edling, which has a similar take on the experimentation Edling started with Abstakt Algebra
