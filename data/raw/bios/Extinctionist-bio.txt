Extinctionist was founded in 2007 by Alex (Philosopher), guitar player and main song writer. Other members initially were singer Thomas (Ex-Disobedience, later in Calliophis), who then was also in Philosopher, another singer, Grimo (later also in  Cytotoxin), and another guitar player, Mitch (Ex-Disobedience).

Little later the band recorded the EP All Flesh Must Be Eaten, available as free download on the band's website (www.extinctionist.de).

After some changes in the line up – singer Thomas left and a drummer, Christoph (Philosopher, Within Dream's Realm, O Graceful Musing's Burden), joined – the band was finally able to play concerts. 

From 2009 to 2010 the band played a whole number of club and festival shows like NRW-Deathfest 2010.

The first full length album of Extinctionist is to be expected in 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Extinctionist">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
