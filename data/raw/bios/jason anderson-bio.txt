Jason is a prolific New England guitarist, singer, and songwriter, with a strong DIY ethic. He is a touring whirlwind, with devoted fan bases in cities and towns across North America and Europe. He has often collaborated with Phil Elverum of The Microphones/Mount Eerie. He was also the drummer for Yume Bitsu. 

While living as a student in Oregon he founded the lively American Rock / Folk group Wolf Colonel which recorded multiple releases on Olympia Washington's K Records. After years of touring with a rotating band roster and solo he began recording and touring as a solo act, (although sometimes with backing band). He released 3 records on K Records as Jason Anderson.

Extensive touring eventually led him back to his New England roots. He began playing shows around the New England subcontinent in the mid 00's solo and in a duo call The Rabbits. More recently he has been in a project group doing American Rock. 

Jason's recordings are a history of artistic progression from humorous and hopeful youth through to the sweet and thoughtful mid-20's. His live concerts are appealing to all ages and genders, his theatrical performing style recalls the works of Homer and Plato, and reminds audience members why people like to see musicians play music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Anderson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
