A 15 year old solo artist with a strong driving sound and message.

"For we all deserve the right to knowledge" The Dark and Bleak started with Jonathyn Arthurs at age 12 and slowly progressed over the course of 3 years and is now becoming more well known among the Ohio music scene.Now, 15 year old Jonathyn Arthurs plans on bringing emotion and theatrics back into the music scene with his stronghold of music and will. "Its not just the music,its the life behind the music." And I plan on making The Dark and Bleak a true life force to behold.

Now with the 2009 album Nowhere being officially recorded in Jonathyns home studio,heavier music and plenty more is ready to come after the full recording session.

"Prepare yourselves for a movement that history itself could never forget,no matter how small,no matter how quiet,and no matter how supposedly insignificant my voice is."
