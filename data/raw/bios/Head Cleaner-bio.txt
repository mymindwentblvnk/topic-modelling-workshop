There are 2 bands called Head Cleaner:

(a) American death/ grind band started in 2002
(b) 1990s Tasmanian hardcore band

(a) HEAD CLEANER's history is divided in two periods:

The first is set between 2002 and 2004, when the band's frontman Jim “Mitch” E. and Vasilis P., sided by session musicians, created the first full length album titled “Intellectual Oxygenation” (2003), which by the way is close to becoming sold-out.

The second period for HEAD CLEANER which is also the more productive starts in 2009 and unfolds until today. Mitch together with Costas, Billy and Lefteris as permanent members, recreated the band on a more death/grind basis, releasing the second full length album “The Protest” (2010) as well as a mini CD titled “Resistance, Determination and the Sheer Will to Overcome” (2012), which has earned astonishing comments internationally, both from printed and electronic media.

Along with this work, HEAD CLEANER have recorded half a dozen new songs for various artists compilations and EPs, which will be released in the Winter, whereas during November & December 2012 the band will record its third full length album which will be released by the American label “United Guttural Records”.

(b) Tasmanian political fast-hardcore band who split in 1995.
