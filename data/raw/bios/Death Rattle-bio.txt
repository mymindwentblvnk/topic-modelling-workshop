Death Rattle (UK)

With recent support from John Kennedy (XFM), Tom Robinson (BBC 6Music) and Amazing Radio plus video features on NME, Artrocker and Clash around their last EPHE&l, London based girl/boy electro-gloom-pop duo Death Rattle return with their second offering - four track EP Fortress released via Frontal Noize on 29th April.

Fortress continues where HE&l left us - on an intense and darkly mesmerising journey through icy and desolate soundscapes. Where HE&l gave us the kind of immediate, dark electro pop and nod-along beats that drew instant comparisons to The Knife and Sleigh Bells, Fortress is its insular, brooding cousin subtly creating an even bleaker, impending-doom feel that their previous release always hinted towards with the band's influences - Depeche Mode, Fever Ray and NIN - becoming ever more apparent.
