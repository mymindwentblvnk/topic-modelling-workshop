One of the first contemporary successful rock bands in Colombia, Los Aterciopelados is among the Latin American countries' top groups. Formed in 1992 in Bogotá, Colombia, the band has fused its own sound by combining a rock-solid approach and electronics with a variety of Latin American musical traditions including mariachi, bolero, tropical and flamenco. 

Aterciopelados, whose name translates as "The Velvety Ones," was formed by former members of Delia Y Los Aminoacidos -- Andrea Echeverri, who plays acoustic guitar and sings lead, and Héctor Buitrago, who plays bass guitar. The original drummer Andres Giraldo* was replaced by Alejandro Duque in 1995 and the original guitar player Charlie Marquez was replaced by Alejandro Gomez Caceras in 1997. Also, lead singer Andrea Echeverri was chosen by Gustavo Cerati to sing "En la Ciudad de la Furia" for Soda Stereo's MTV Unplugged album.

Andrés Giraldo was also part of the Bogotá based band Bloque de Busqueda, known for their mix of artisan / folkloric music with a modern twist full of prominent beats.

Echeverri came out with a self-titled solo album in 2004, "Aemeo" is the lead song in this album. 

The band recieved Grammy award nominations in 1997 and 1998. 

In October of 2006 they released the album Oye, just a couple of months after Héctor Buitrago came out with his Conhector first solo album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aterciopelados">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
