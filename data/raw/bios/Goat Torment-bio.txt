Goat Torment was formed in Belgium in 2008 by Kwel and K.J. with the intention to create music as a weapon of mass destruction and to annihilate everything which the so-called society stands for. 
   For a start Kwel was supposed to play bass and K.J would handle the vocals. But they didn’t find a guitarist who fitted with the ideology on a serious level. Thus Kwel decided to handle all the guitar parts and K.J. started to play bass. 
   After some months of research, the band recruited drummer Perversor. 
   Then the band released a 4-track demo tape, released in 2009 through Terrorghoul Productions from Austria. The reactions were tremendous and bigger labels contacted the band interested to release the future offerings of Goat Torment. 
   At this point, the band shared stages all over Europe with bands such as Proclamation, Hell Militia, Enthroned, Black Crucifixion, Black Witchery, The Devil’s blood… to name but a few. At the beginning of 2010 GT had to part ways with drummer Perversor due to musical differences.
   During the early days of April 2010 a new burning entity was found: S. claimed the throne behind the battery. The Death wielding Trinity of Goat Torment was complete. 
   New songs were written, gigs were played and blood was shed.
   Exactly one year later, the band entered the infamous Blackout Multimedia Studio to record some tracks for two upcoming releases: A 7” split EP with The Beast which was released at the beginning of 2012 and later that year another 7” EP , called “Into The Mouth of the Serpent”. Directly after the split EP was released, Kwel and S. decided to split ways with K.J. due to different views about their future. In that moment GT decided to go on as a duet recruiting session members for live-shows. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Goat+Torment">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
