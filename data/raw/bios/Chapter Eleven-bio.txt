Born out of the systematic breaking of Hassan's fucked-up teenage band FourLetterCure, he and Asher began playing acoustic shows full of old FLC songs and covers to fill the lineups the band were booked to play before their sudden departure back in August 2010. Since then, they have been writing songs in their spare time, supported the absolutely legendary Ian Britt and recorded their debut EP with Martin Savale of the Asian Dub Foundation.

During the recording of their EP, Asher enlisted the assistance of long-time friend, Stuart "Sweep" Sim on bass duties. Both he and Hassan were so impressed with Sweep's sound that they decided he would become a (more or less) permanent addition to the band's live line up.

Chapter Eleven's debut EP will be released on Pornography For Cowards Records in early May 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chapter+Eleven">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
