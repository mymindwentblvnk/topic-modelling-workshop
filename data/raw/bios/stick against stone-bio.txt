Stick Against Stone is a Post-punk / No Wave band from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; that later resided in Brooklyn, New York; Eugene, Oregon and San Francisco, California and remained active (in no less than six incarnations) between 1981 and 1990. The group returned to performing in 2011 and currently resides in the New York City area.

Since their founding, the band went through several line-up changes, but never released a full album until 2010 – and it wasn't until the 2014 release of The Oregon Bootleg Tapes - Live (a live recording from 1985) that critical attention finally arrived in the form of positive reviews in New York Magazine, Vibe, Wax Poetics, Cuepoint (Robert Christgau) and Pitchfork, where writer Miles Raymer remarked about the group: “They had their eyes on the there and then, but they were playing 20 years into the future.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stick+Against+Stone">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
