Pax Satana was created in early 2003, with original guitarist Matt Drozdeck, Ryan, Ed, and Justin with another under the name Baphomet it later became Laid to Rest and finally Pax Satana. Matt left in the summer of 2004 due to his move to Florida but that didnt stop Us. Justin had been playing 4 string, while Ed growled and Ryan blasted the battery, yet our 5th left due to our short hiatus. We were guitarless but pressed on, seeking a different sound than what we had been playing before. At the end of 2004 with renewed vigor, we invited Danielle for keys, And Rose on guitars. We had risen from the ashes to burst out onthe the local Black Metal scene. On April 8th 2005, we had our first show in Staten Island's Doc Street bar and grill. Yet even with our newsound sound there was something missing from the quintet. This was a true lead guitar, which we found in Cory . A few Shows and moons later we recorded our first demo, which reamins untitled. Our album was met with success among the local scene, yet that did not prevent internal conflict. A Short hiatus ensued and Cory sadly left the band, taking a critical piece with him. This would not hinder our motives though, and we would press on to rise once more. Shortly thereafter, our comrade in arms Craig , joined us in the fight as our new lead guitarist. This proves that our black flame shall not be snuffed that easily. We will Return... Pax Satana is now in the middle of creating new material. We have much prepared and are excited to unleash it upon our listeners. We are about to record our new demo which shows a new sound to the band then our pervious songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pax+Satana">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
