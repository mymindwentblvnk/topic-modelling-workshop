Curt Kirkwood (born January 10, 1959) is an American musician, who sings and plays guitar. He was the front man and founding member for the alternative rock group Meat Puppets. He formed the band along with his brother, Cris, and drummer Derrick Bostrom, in 1980. The trio disbanded in 1996, although Curt re-formed Meat Puppets with Kyle Ellison (guitar), Andrew Duplantis (bass) and Shandon Sahm (drums) to complete one studio album, Golden Lies in 2000. After Meat Puppets, Curt toured solo a bit before banding together with Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic and Sublime drummer Bud Gaugh to form Eyes Adrift. They released a self-titled album in 2002 and toured the United States before disbanding. Curt then formed another band, Volcano, released one album, and then broke out to go solo. His solo album Snow was released in October of 2005.

Curt lives in Austin, Texas.

In 2006, his band Meat Puppets reformed with Cris and new drummer Tim Alexander (of Primus) as the replacement of Derrick Bostrom. The band has already planned to write and record their eleventh studio album, due for release sometime in 2007.

Ted Marcus now sits on the drums for the Meat Puppets. "CURT KIRKWOOD: Well, you know, it's basically the same lineup -- because it's my brother and I ... then Ted, the drummer, he's a Meat Puppets fan." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Curt+Kirkwood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
