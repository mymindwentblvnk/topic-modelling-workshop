1 After bubbling beneath Toronto's swampy surface for roughly 2 human years, KEEF has finally emerged from the shadows to tingle spines, curdle blood and spread the gospel of the riff. Heavily influenced by heavy bands including Black Sabbath, Sleep, and Electric Wizard, KEEF pays tribute to the traditions of old school doom and the high-volume fuzz of modern stoner rock.

Lose yourself in throbbing bass lines, suffer the ear crushing onslaught of stick beating skin, beg for mercy as the inescapable drone of doom seizes your psyche. Protect your children from the unholy howl.
