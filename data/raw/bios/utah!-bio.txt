we officially broke up the 'tah in october or so.

it was very sad, we have new band, it's me, mickey, another guy... jon yu, and hopefully 2 more people asap. we have our first show aug. 9th, no band name yet. me and jon yu have been writing everything, all the parts and shit for quite a while. so we're about ready to get active in the scene again. 

other than that, we're doing alright down here, mickey bought a house, doesn't have a job at the moment. he was playing drums for the Rosebuds for a bit, but no more. anne is finally taking the steps to go to grad school. she's playing cello for random people and sitting in here and there. were all on great terms though. i bartend for work, i like it. good money fast, leaves plenty of time for working on music. play soccer a lot, bifocal media has an indoor soccer team, but i busted my foot the other night, stress fracture, sucks cuz i totally can't work for about 3 weeks or so. time for music though. and time for foodnetwork. cooking's become quite a hobby. make my own pizza's and whatever. generally trying to understand and hopefully perfect italian cuisine's as best i can. it's a lot of fun.

always remember and never forget utah!

Don't ever turn your backs on rock and roll!
