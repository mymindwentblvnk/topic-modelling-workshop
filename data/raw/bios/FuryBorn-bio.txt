FuryBorn hit the metal scene in April 2011 from the ashes of various other projects with the goal of creating a fusion of music inspired by their individual influences.
Quickly establishing a sound they loved taking influences from the intensity and chorus-driven cyber metal of Fear Factory and Divine Heresy, to the tight rhythmic soundscapes and harmony guitars of Soilwork and In Flames et al, as well as incorporating the guitar pyrotechnic styles of Children Of Bodom, Nevermore, and Scar Symmetry.

Having already shared stages with the likes of The Defiled, Romeo Must Die and Snakebite, Malefice, Revoker, Ted Maul and the legendary Napalm Death plus an appearance at Bloodstock Open Air 2011 thanks to their Metal 2 The Masses 2011 win, these guys are looking to make a serious impact on the UK metal scene, and beyond.

Keep your eyes peeled for FuryBorn's up-coming debut EP release, 'The Reaping Of Our Days' out January 23rd 2012 and showcasing the bands varying influences into an epic, frantic juggernaut of a first release <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/FuryBorn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
