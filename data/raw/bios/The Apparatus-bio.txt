From Trondheim, Norway, The Apparatus started jamming in Ketil Sæthers basement summer of 2000 and soon found their style to be brutal, yet technical and melodic. They recorded two demos in 2001 and 2003 which were sent to various record labels, but with no luck. In 2004 they entered Godt Selskap Studios in Trondheim to record a self financed, full length album which later gave them a deal with british label Dreamcatcher Records. After the release of their long-awaited debut album "Heathen Agenda" they soon split up for internal reasons, but Øystein Iversen is reportedly making new songs under the same flag with a new lineup.
