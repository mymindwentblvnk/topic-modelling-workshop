We are Ebrietor.
We don't have a philosophy nor agenda. We play low-tuned and fast metal. We do it because we like it.
The idea of starting Ebrietor was spawned during Erik's prenuptial beer-binge in late spring 2014. One year later the band members conveniently converged to Piteå, Sweden, where we've been creating and refining music ever since.
Our first EP "The Bohemian Blastphemy" was completed around the heathen/christian festivities in December of 2015. It was recorded, mixed and mastered by us.
Shortly after our first gig Jonas had to leave Ebrietor and Emil Landström joined in. 
Line up:
Fredrik Nyman - Vocals,
Erik Flodin - Guitar,
