Images of Eden is a melodic, passion-based progressive hard rock/metal project originating from the Baltimore, MD/ York, PA-USA region. With the release of 2 full length CDs- "Chapter I" (Independent- 2001) & "Sunlight of the Spirit" (Nightmare Records- 2006), and playing live over the past 6 years, they are quickly gaining notoriety locally, as well as through North America and Europe. Images of Eden has a unique sound that mixes in the technical elements of late 80s/ early 90s progressive hard rock/metal (intricate guitar/ vocal arrangements) with an energy comparable to today's music, and has been compared to (and influenced by) such bands as Queensryche, Fates Warning, Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, and Disturbed - amongst others.

The "Images of Eden" concept was founded in 1999 by vocalist, guitarist, songwriter- Gordon Tittsworth, in hopes of putting together a powerful and unique, melodic/prog-metal project.

"Eden" describes the inner peace, serenity, strength, and love that lies within us all. The weight of the world every day can be a heavy burden on us, but one must separate themselves and their own lives from the outside world and find their own "Eden". Quality of life should not be judged by one's surroundings, but how one adapts to and deals with their surroundings, because a perfect world can truly exist. It can be found inside one's own mind, body and soul. You can choose to exist in a apathetic, dismal world of negativity- or you can choose to find the "Eden" that lies within you.

Images of Eden is a very unique band in that each CD (album, release) is a story, portraying an ongoing journey through life, told in a very positive/ uplifting way, with each release picking up where the previous one has left off.

Images of Eden list an extremely wide range of influences ... Fates Warning, Queensryche, Badlands, Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Blind Guardian, Rush, Kansas, Genesis, Marillion, Porcupine Tree, Spock's Beard,  and Joe Satriani ... to name but a few.
