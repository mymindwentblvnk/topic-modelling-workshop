Black Metal Band From France

DEPRESSIVE WINTER was born in 2003 with following line-up :
Profane (vocals & guitar)
Necro (Drums) - also plays in Napalm and False Prophet
Cardinal Doom (guitar) - also plays in Puka Ana
Vomitch (bass for gigs)

At the begining, the band played a norwegian tradition black metal with many other influences (ambiant...). 
Cause of job and distance, Necro had to leave the band. Cardinal Doom was fired cause of new musical influence. 

After that Profane continued alone and begin recording the first album with a new member Tuomas Ausson (drums, guitar & bass). 
Naturally DEPRESSIVE WINTER evoluates with more melodic parts but brutality is always here. 
The recording of the album was made in july, august and september 2006. 
Finally the album "Llac Edicius" was released in october 2006.
