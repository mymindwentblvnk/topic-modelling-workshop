Hasserben was created around the end of 2005 by Dagon (guitar), joined by Wörg (drums), then some months later by Ulfar (bass) and Nokturn (vocals). Morthvargr (2nd guitar) joined the band in 2008. 

January 2009, Wörg decided to leave the band because of too many differences of opinions with other members. He was replaced a few weeks later by Tourment, drummer from "Mémoire de neige". 

Hasserben plays Black Metal exclusively, with no lie and no compromise. Hasserben belongs to the C.M.S with "Autarcie", Ciel Nocturne and Dyster 

The first demo-tape of Hasserben, "Chants d'Automne", is available on INFERNAL KOMMANDO Records. A second demo-tape will be released soon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hasserben">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
