Blood Spill - Although forming in early 2007, no music was produced until early 2009, yes it has taken that long to produce the quality songs such as “Any Gravy” or the track inspired by Saint Patricks day “do some Irish”. Currently working on their first album release “a knife in the back hurts like hell” they look to build on their fan base upon finishing this creation and promoting themselves through a music page on myspace. Links will be provided once avaliable.

To sum up Blood Spill, there a band that take on every day issues with a metal twist, influenced heavily by the darker metals around this can be heard through their heavy guitar riffs and drum loops. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Blood+Spill">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
