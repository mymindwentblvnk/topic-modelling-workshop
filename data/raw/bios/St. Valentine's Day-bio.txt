St. Valentine's Day was a doom metal band from Lugansk, Ukraine. They released their debut album "From Land of the Lonely Hearts" in 1996. The band's original style was a slow death doom metal with funeral doom metal elements.
The band's second album, "In Black Velvet Streams", was recorded between March and May 1998 at the Symon Records Studio. Their music shows a more mature sound, now with elements of black metal and gothic metal, and small electronics sections.
In 1999, after some members left the group, the band radically changed style and started to play post-doom metal / trip rock with clean vocals. The third and final album, "Аура", was released in 2003. The band split up shortly after, although leaving a significant contribution to the history of Ukrainian metal music, being one of the first doom metal bands from Ukraine. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/St.+Valentine%27s+Day">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
