Dub Trio is a live dub/rock band from Brooklyn, New York.

Dub Trio is made up by DP Holmes (guitar & keyboards), Stu Brooks (bass & keyboards) and Joe Tomino (drums & melodica). With revolutionary combinations of electronic, rock, and jazz, Dub Trio pay homage to King Tubby's original dub style. In the past they have toured with Meat Beat Manifesto and Soulive. They are all sought after session musicians, having recorded with the likes of Bo Bice, G-Unit, Tony Yayo, Mobb Deep, and Macy Gray. Joe Tomino recently recorded an album with The Fugees. DP Holmes can be heard on albums by Mos Def and Common.

In 2005 Dub Trio embarked on their first recorded effort with vocals, exchanging files with Mike Patton. This song, titled "Not Alone", was featured on both Dub Trio's 2006 sophomore record, New Heavy as well as Mike Patton's 2006 album under the artist name Peeping Tom, also accompanying Peeping Tom on tour in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dub+Trio">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
