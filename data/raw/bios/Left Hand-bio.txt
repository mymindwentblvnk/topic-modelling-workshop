Left Hand are a London four-piece who specialise in post rock and maths rock.
After forming in 1996 they have so far released two EPs (Blue Apples and Mathematics) and three albums - Minus 8, On Discovering Fire and most recently Into Light, which was recorded by Liam Watson at Toerag studios (famous for the recording of The White Stripes’ classic album Elephant) and features contributions from Mary Hansen (Stereolab) and Terry Edwards (Gallon Drunk).
