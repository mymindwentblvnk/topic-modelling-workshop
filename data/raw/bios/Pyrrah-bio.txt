Pyrrah began with founder, Dave Whelan in 2005.  The band had gone through many member changes before it became a serious project.   It was only after Dave met guitarist, George Matthew in high school that original song writing and searching for permanent members began.  They went through many vocalists before finding the perfect fit, Christine P. Newman.  As they were having difficulties finding a good drummer, they continued with song writing and during this time, Gary Effing Cancer of Creep Colony offered to help the band by contributing drum tracks to their upcoming EP. His work can be heard on the songs, “Bestial Plague” and “Human Debris.” Christine and a friend found drummer, Dave Gouk at a local show and as of June 2007, the band had solidified their line-up for the first time and began to work on their EP entitled “Eternal Cremation.” Recording began in late 2007, and was completed by early 2008.  Since, Pyrrah has played shows with legendary death metal bands Incantation, Estuary, Funerus, Lapidate and many more.  During the summer of 2008, Dave Gouk had to leave the band for personal reasons and the search for a new drummer began once again.  In early 2009, after much searching, the band has once again solidified its line-up with the addition of drummer Glennmar Miculob.  They are currently working on new material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pyrrah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
