1) Black Horizon was founded in 1995 by Dr.No (Menno CCHM Meerbach). Influenced by The Sisters of Mercy, Fields of the Nephilim, Nine Inch Nails and Swans, many songs were written and recorded by Dr.No and B-Leaf. 

In 2002 the band released their debut INFINITY OF CHAOS via Transmission Records. The album features co production by Alain Monod (Young Gods), additional vocals by Helena Iren Michaelsen (ex Trail of tears), Mix and production by Sasha Paeth (Rhapsody). The warm organic industrial style of music yielded many great reviews and very enthusiastic fan responses.

After some concerts, there was a four year silence in which Dr.No worked almost solo (guitarist Belphegor was very helpful) and solely on SPECULUM ANIMAE, an enormous project. A DVD that combines a full industrial album, but with the option to listen to it in English or in Dutch. A novelty. Besides that, the DVD offers full moving artwork to all of the music. Lyrics are available for both languages and are even adjustable in style.

To chill out, the album features another hour of industrial ambient soundscapes, also with video artwork. Together with the exclusive web-connect option, you have an interactive experience unseen before. 

2) Black Horizon (Norway) was formed at TrønderTun Folkehøgskole in 2009.  Influences are Nightwish, Children of Bodom, Symphony X, Alestorm, Keep of Kalessin etc.
