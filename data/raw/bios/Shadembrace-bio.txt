The story of the band started officially in the year 2002, when the four guys (Janne, Mika, Ville, Juhani) decided to form an alliance. The guys had played
together in different lineups few times before, but this alliance or gentlemen’s club gave them a perfect excuse to party and have a good time.

The following year, 2003, Janne and Mika were partying at the Nummirock festival and they came across with a strange creature. It was a slightly intoxicated and lost little girl, Jenny. The boys felt sorry for her so they decided to adopt the poor thing.

Before Jenny’s joining the band had recorded two demos, only one of them under the name Shadembrace. Now came the time to see (and hear) how Jenny’s vocals and keyboard would sound with the rest of the noise and scream.

The band entered in a studio and came out with a single song “Beside you”. The great audience (both of them) showed interest and gave positive feedback about the song and claimed that they wanted to hear some more.
In the year 2005 the band marched into the studio again, this time to record three new songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shadembrace">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
