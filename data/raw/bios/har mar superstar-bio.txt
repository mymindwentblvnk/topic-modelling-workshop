Sean Tillmann is an American entertainer widely known by his stage name  Har Mar Superstar.  Hailing from Minneapolis, MN, Tillmann has traveled the world over the past 25 years, performing concerts on five continents.  In addition to seven albums recorded under the  Har Mar Superstar  moniker, Tillmann has released many albums under an array of assumed names and has performed in several side projects ( Sean Na Na ,  Calvin Krime ,  Gayngs ,  Neon Neon ).  2020 marked the release of the first album with Tillmann’s new band --  Heart Bones -- co-writing with Austin, TX’s own Sabrina Ellis (A Giant Dog,  Sweet Spirit).

Tillmann has gained international notoriety with his over-the-top live performances that often end sweat soaked and scantily clad. His wild stage antics and legendary singing prowess have landed him on tours performing with and opening for  The Strokes,  Red Hot Chili Peppers,  Yeah Yeah Yeahs,  Sia,  Gossip,  Lizzo,  The Afghan Whigs, and  Atom and His Package, to name a few. Armed with just a microphone, a mini-disc player, and small canon of low-fi R & B songs in the early years, Tillmann earned fans through sweat equity. Now, Har Mar Superstar has become a seven-piece, full-on soul review that plays the greatest hits of Tillmann’s mind. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Har+Mar+Superstar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
