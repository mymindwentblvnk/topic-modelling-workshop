Formed in 2003, Shit Goat began life as a one-man project in the vision of Kevin Stankiewicz, originally just a cheap vehicle for poking fun at grindcore bands. Soon thereafter guitarist James McDonald was ensnared to play guitar on the project and some very, very bad recordings were made in early 2004 which will never see the light of day. Then the project was shelved for some time, with empty-handed threats to those who managed to hear the original recordings that the Shit Goat would come again. Over the remaining months of 2004, with some remorse over the quality of the original recordings, a decision was made. Shit Goat would drop the parody mantle and finally become a serious project. Well, as serious as any band with a song titled "You Smell Like Rotten Meat" gets. Finally, in January 2005, the decision was set. The Shit Goat would, indeed, rise again. To this end, Swedish guitarist Petter Carnbro was affixed to the project, thanks to the wonders of the internet, and the spark between Petter and Kevin eventually shaped the debut album, Hail the Goat, released on June 6th 2006. The album sold pretty much as expected, and the official site averaged over a hundred hits daily in the month that followed. 

Currently Shit Goat are currently writing and rehearsing for their next release, tentatively planned for Christmas 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shit+Goat">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
