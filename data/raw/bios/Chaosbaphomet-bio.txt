CHAOSBAPHOMET formed by Ravenlord Wampyri Draconium of Empire Of The Moon and Iapetos 666 of Unholy Archangel in 34 Anno Satanas with the purpose to experiment in the Satanic Dogma through Black Metal Art!!

With the addition of Warhead on session drumming Chaosbaphomet entered the "Underground Studios"in 38 Anno Satanas and recorded their debut release named "TEMPLE OF THE SERPENT BAPHOMET" which constitutes three spells of Satanic Black Metal! "TEMPLE OF THE SERPENT BAPHOMET" released by ACHERONTAS PROMOTIONS (001) in corporation with UNHOLY DISTRO (007) and distributed exclusively by them.

In 40 Anno Satanas Crucifixion Wounds horde proposed a split 7''ep to Chaosbaphomet. Chaosbaphomet accepted that corporation and released a split 7"ep with a new spell called "REX DEMONICUS" through the German DEATHSTRIKE RECORDS (DR048).

After the release of "REX DEMONICUS" 7"ep the CHAOS and the BAPHOMET unite again as one and enter the studio for the recordings of the new upcoming full-length release.
