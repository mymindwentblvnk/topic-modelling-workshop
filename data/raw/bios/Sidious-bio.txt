SIDIOUS are a five piece blackened death metal band from London, UK. Assimilated from a variety of underground acts (including fellow Kaotoxin doom/death outfit Eye of Solitude) SIDIOUS draw influence from across the extreme metal spectrum, ranging from symphonic black to brutal death. With over five years of involvement in joint musical ventures, the members of SIDIOUS have come to create music both powerful in meaning and delivery.
