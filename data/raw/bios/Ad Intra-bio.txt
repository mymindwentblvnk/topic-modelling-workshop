Ad Intra is a Doom/Death band from Venezuela and currently residing in A Coru√±a, Spain. Ad Intra was founded by Yessika Marquez (guitars) and Mariana Salgado (keyboards), who were soon joined by Daniel Luces on bass and vocals. With this lineup and with Daniel also taking the duties of drum programming and producing/mixing, the band recorded a two song demo "The Attic" which is now available for free download at their myspace page and for sale in Cd format at some cities in Venezuela. After the finishing of  "The Attic" Mariana Salgado leaves the band and Ad Intra suffered various lineup changes, until the band moved their residence to Spain for personal reasons. Ad Intra is currently in the process of recording their debut album, with the drums being recorded in Venezuela by drummer Juan Gonzalez and the rest in Spain with the latest inclusion of Galician native guitarist Alex Pernas. The album is due to be released in late 2011.
