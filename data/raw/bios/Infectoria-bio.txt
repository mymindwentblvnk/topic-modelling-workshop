Infectoria started back in the year 2000 in Fajardo, Puerto Rico. After a few line up changes the band became what it is today. Jaime and Danny(guitars), Omar(bass), Anibal(keyboard), Thrasher(drums) and Blacky(vocals).The bands main goal has always been uniting the death metal scene and the hardcore scene within Puerto Rico. With this goal in mind Infectoria has created their own style with each song being a little different from the next. The band has earned their respect within Puerto Ricos scene and with their first cd release they expect to take the puertorican scene by storm and bring their distinctive sound to the rest of the world.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Infectoria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
