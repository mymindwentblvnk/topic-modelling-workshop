band from United Kingdom
Everette hailed from Salford, UK playing melodic metal with plenty of heavy riffs. The band came together in 2003. After a number of member changes and self-released EPs, the band embarked on their first tour with Glasgow's finest, Azriel in the summer of 2005. The tour was a success and the band were signed up to Thirty Days of Night Records who subsequently released their 'A Battle Awaits' EP. They toured again with label mates Eternal Lord and Clone The Fragile in the summer of 2006. As well as the aforementioned tours, the band shared the stage with the likes of Shai Hulud, Bring Me The Horizon, Himsa, The Black Dahlia Murder, The Red Chord and many more.

The band played their last show in late 2007. Members have since gone on to perform in Fill The Void and Veils.
