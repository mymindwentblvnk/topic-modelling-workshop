Esbjörn Svensson Trio (or e.s.t) was a Swedish jazz piano trio formed in 1990 with Esbjörn Svensson (piano) (died 14 June 2008), Dan Berglund (double bass) and Magnus Öström (drums).  [not to be confused with Electro Shock Therapy or an Italian band EST that has an album listed here as Mostrati] 

e.s.t was renowned for their vibrant style - playing in rock venues to young crowds. They achieved great commercial success and critical acclaim throughout Europe. Their 1999 release "From Gagarin's Point of View" started their international breakthrough, being the first e.s.t. album to be released outside of Scandinavia through the German label ACT. The group was the first — and still the only — European Group to appear on the cover of Downbeat Magazine.

In 1995 and 1996 Esbjörn Svensson was awarded Swedish Jazz Musician of the Year and 1998 Songwriter of the Year, and the 1997 release "Winter in Venice" – consisting mainly of original material – was awarded the Swedish Grammy.
