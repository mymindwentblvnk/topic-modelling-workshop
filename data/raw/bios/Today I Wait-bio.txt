Finding equal strength in both slow, grinding grooves and double-time, 
double-bass syncopations, Detroit's Today I Wait displays superior 
musicianship and disciplined songwriting while simultaneously channeling 
furious aggression into the band's Friction Records debut. These nine 
highly tuned, highly brutal refined metal offerings consistently display 
technical wizardry and even manage to insert dynamite (though short-lived) 
vocal hooks among a constantly shifting storm of instrumental 
sections and spirited screaming, such as in "Troubleshooting" and "Box Set."
