Geordi La Force is the journey of a man armed with one guitar and a super computer. 

After playing in various bands in Glasgow, he decided to brave it alone; there were too many weird and wonderful songs riffing around his prog-metal-fusion inspired mind and ‘La Force was the perfect outlet. 

It is hard to describe exactly what GLF sounds like… a little like Chick Corea body slamming Allan Holdsworth into a piano perhaps? 

Geordi La Force’s first EP ‘Processed Into Fifths’ was released in 2006. It was self recorded and mixed and shortly after it received a rave review in Terrorizer Magazine. 

Since then Rock Sound Magazine gave GLF’s “A Cheap Looking Demo” an admirable 7/10. Drowned in Sound also reviewed La Force saying this of “The Dog That Couldn’t Piss”: 

“‘The Dog That Couldn’t Piss’ wins out purely because of its title – brittle electro of backbone, it’s a pulsating little number that morphs into RPG-style ambience and back to blitz-speed cricket beats in a heartbeat. Oddly captivating.” 

Anyone who sees the man and his laptop live will tell you that GLF’s eye-popping performances are absolutely legendary. His lightning quick taps and ear-melting riffs leave audiences thirsting for more. Now with added visuals, the whole performance is a spectacle to behold with old videos of Chuck Norris working-out 80s style whilst GLF weaves his rock wizardry on the guitar. 

Surreal but bloody blinding.
