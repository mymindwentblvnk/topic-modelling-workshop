Scott Motyka, (pronounced moh-teek-uh), is a no-frills melodic shred guitarist merging old-school fusion-rock vibe, with modern day progressive metal. Imagine Robben Ford with Tool, performing Paul Gilbert’s ‘Scarified’, plugged into Joe Satriani’s JSX.

Hailing from the rural suburbs of New England, Scott brings a fuel-injected, edge of your seat attack, which is equally at home ripping the hardest of rocker’s head’s off as it is melting listeners with introspective finesse. Whether he’s performing, recording or teaching, he delivers a  passion and energy for his art sure to please hard rock guitar aficionados and shred-fanatics alike.

On his newly released CD, entitled “Cut..  ...From Within.” one hears a collection of close to the heart, hard-hitting instrumental rock tunes inspired by the artist’s trials and tribulations with religion, politics and existential despair.  “Cut.., is about emotional pain and how we choose to deal with that pain, I wanted to explore some of the key turning points in my life and make a record that captured those experiences, -and in this case, without words.” Motyka’s instrumental dissertation screams of pain, questioning and angst.  From the ‘gnashing of teeth’ tonality found on tracks like “Betrayer’s Trust”, to the solemn intimate resolve heard within “Rabbiam”, this artist projects a depth and dynamic not often found of guitar players in the heavy electric genre. 

In 2009, be sure not to miss this unknown emerging Indie artist. With a new record in hand, and power trio on deck, Scott begins his mission, fighting the battle for your mind, one note at a time.  Armed with a profound ‘secular spirituality’, he asks you to listen with courage, for it just may be -the sound of everything you believe, becoming a lie.
