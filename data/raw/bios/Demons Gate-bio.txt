Secretive Australian doom band that released a demo tape in 2006 and a 7" split with Murkrat in 2009. The demo was later re-released eponymously in various formats. The band was working on a full-length which would have been ready for an early 2010 release but nothing has materialized as of 2015. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demons+Gate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
