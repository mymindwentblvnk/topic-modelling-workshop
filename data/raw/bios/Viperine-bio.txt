Viperine is a band from Sweden. Their style reminds of the older Manowar works. They have released only one album "The Predator Awakens"  Via Metal-Rules records in july 2004. Because of insufficient advertising this album never sold really well, despite the album received excellent reviews, and only a limited number of copies have been made. Shortly after this downer, guitar player Payre left the band, eager to play some other styles of metal, since then, nothing has been heard of Viperine anymore. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Viperine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
