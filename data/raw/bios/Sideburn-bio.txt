There is more than one artist named Sideburn:

1.) Sideburn is a classic rock/metal band from Lausanne, Switzerland. They are heavily influenced by bands such as AC/DC, ZZ Top, Rose Tattoo, and Krokus. They began recording under the name Genocide in 1989, and it wasn't until 1997 when their style evolved in the direction of rock that they decided to rename the band to Sideburn.

2.) Sideburn is a heavy metal/stoner rock band formed in Sweden in 1997. In the beginning there was Morgan Zocek (guitar), and Tor Pentèn (drums) who met each other in a club in Stockholm. They shared the same musical vision and influences (bluesy hard rock) in bands like Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Rainbow, The Cult, and Kyuss among others. In 1998 they placed an ad in some music stores in Stockholm for a new singer. And finally one day they got a call from Jani Kataja.

After over 6 years together, Sideburn parted ways with drummer Tor Pentèn. They started looking for a new drummer and Morgan approached Fredrik Broqvist, an old friend from school. Current lineup: Jani Kataja (lead vocals, guitar, bass), Morgan Zocek (lead guitar, vocals), Martin Karlsson (bass, organ, vocals), Fredrik Broqvist (drums, vocals). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sideburn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
