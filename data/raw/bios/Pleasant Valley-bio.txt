pleasant valley are a band.
they dislike capital letters as a rule.
they are made of cats taped together.
they are better than some bands, but then again they are worse than others. they wish they could play lots of warehouse shows.

their bass player is leaving town for good, line up changes soon to occur. next year: bigger and better and more chained amps. werd
they would love to play a show with you, just ask them, they'll do it for sure.
they want to be liked. 

they are giving away mp3s online at:
