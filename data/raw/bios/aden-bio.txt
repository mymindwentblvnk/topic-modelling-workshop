1) Aden was an American indie-pop band that formed at the University of Chicago in 1995. Over the next five years, the band managed to release three critically acclaimed albums despite impediments in the forms of heavy drummer turnover and constant touring.
After 1997, when original drummer Josh Klein left the band (he then played in Vitesse and writes) Aden's members have not lived in the same city so its members shuffled back and forth between Chicago, Washington D.C., Charlottesville, VA and Brooklyn.
