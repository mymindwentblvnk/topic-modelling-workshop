A hard-hitting, groove-laden East Tennessee band that pretends to be nothing more than what it is – pure and honest metal. From bluesy to blistering to brutal, Scent of Remains serves up a mix of songs characterized by pounding and rolling grooves, screaming leads and a unique mix of vocal styles.

Formed in the summer of 2009 by drummer Paul Shippers and some local friends, Scent of Remains, like many new projects, went through several early lineup changes before Shippers finally got together with lead-guitarist Herb Himes and rhythm guitarist Luc Nuytten to solidify the creative nucleus of the band. Vocalist Daniel Fischer was the final player added to the mix, replacing original vocalist Jonathan Davis.

“Things just clicked between all of us,” says Himes. “We had a solid set of nine original songs early on, and when Daniel came on, he added that additional dynamic we were looking for in a vocalist. Because he has 4 or 5 different voices he can alternate between, he gives us tons of flexibility creatively – we’re not limited at all.”

In a metal world where everything seemingly must be neatly put into categories, Scent of Remains simply thinks of themselves as honest, hard-hitting, groove-oriented metal.

The band entered the studio in March of 2010 to cut their first full-length CD entitled mind.thought.fear. The disc was recorded at The Soundlair, the same Knoxville studio that recorded early independent works by Whitechapel and Straight Line Stitch.

Released in August 2010, mind.thought.fear offers a true representation as to what Scent of Remains is all about.

The band is currently gigging all around the Southeast in support of their mind.thought.fear album and working on new material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scent+Of+Remains">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
