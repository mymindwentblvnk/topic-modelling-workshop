There are 3 bands called Sinatras:

1.  An obscure mid 70s punk band from NYC.  The Sinatras. Started in 1976, based in NYC, the band was quite popular at CBGB's and Max's Kansas City. In 1979 they released a 7‚Äù called "Teddy Crashes Blond Dies" b/w "Some Other Boys" on Congressional Records in 1979, which is now totally impossible to find. Their sound was directly inspired from bands such New York Dolls and The Heartbreakers.

2.  An Indie rock from Uruguay.

3. A death'n'roll band from Vicenza, Italy. Mix the Thrash of 80's, the Death of 90's with the freshness of Rock'n'Roll and the attitude of old school Hardcore. It will be surely appreciate from fans of CARCASS, ENTOMBED, PANTERA, HATEBREED...and many more.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sinatras">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
