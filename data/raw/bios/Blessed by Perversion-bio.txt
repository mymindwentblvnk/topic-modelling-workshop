Blessed By Perversion, a Death Metal band from Athens, Greece. The band have released their EP "Destroy the Image of God" in 2012 Blessed By Perversion was created in the middle of 2010. It was an idea of Andreas and Kostas who played together in another band called Seventh Ceremony in a live performance and after that decided to make their own group. After a few months Manolis joined the band giving us a breathing with his great bass skills. One year after band's birth appeared Dimitris who was available to help us and to join the band. In the early of 2014 Vaggelis joined the group as our new bassist as well Manolis became our second guitarist!
The lyrics are about Anti-Christianity, Anti-Religion & Atheism.
