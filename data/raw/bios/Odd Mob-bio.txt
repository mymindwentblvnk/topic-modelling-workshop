Forged from the Brisbane clubbing scene, Robbie Jacobs and Harry Hope make up the Australian DJ/Producer duo Odd Mob. These two young talented artists joined forces to create one of Australia’s freshest genre defying acts of the electronic dance scene. Having being featured on Diplo & Friends and DJ Mag in their first year together it shows that there are no limits for what’s to come for this dynamic pair. Central Station Records’ discovery of the unique Odd Mob sound lead to global recognition and opened doors for further domination of the music scene. With an official remix for Stanton Warriors under their belt and many other major affiliations such as an official Mark Knight remix, Wild Summer 2014 compilation and having their original ‘Jungla’ featured on Kontor’s new Big City Beats Volume 20 CD mix it is evident that this duo has the production skills to impress.

Odd Mob’s highly dynamic live shows are gaining recognition and have landed them festival sets at Stereosonic, Future Music Festival and many club features including Oh Hello, Playground, Marco Polo and Soho to name a few. Having already supported What So Not, Baauer, Jack Beats and Indian Summer it is clear that Odd Mob will be an exceptional act to keep an eye (and ear) on. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Odd+Mob">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
