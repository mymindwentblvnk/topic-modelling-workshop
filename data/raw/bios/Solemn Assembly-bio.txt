Solemn Assembly was formed in Dallas Texas in December of 1989 after the breakup of the first incarnation of experimental noise terrorists, VAMPIRE CATHEDRAL. Joe Virus and Andy Baker started writing danceable industrial music using found sound percussion and analog synths. Andy left the band in 1992 and SOLEMN ASSEMBLY became Joe Virus' solo music project. 

Since 1994, SOLEMN ASSEMBLY has performed live supporting acts like Sheep On Drugs, Test Dept., Spahn Ranch, God Module, Assemblage 23, Covenant, Evil Mothers, Terrorfakt, E-Craft, and more. 

SOLEMN ASSEMBLY's live lineup has been a revolving door of local Dallas electronic musicians, including Josh Pyle & Matthew Edwards of AUDIO PARADOX/APHORISM/OUTSOURCE, Tony Greene of EXCEPT EUROPA/LOLLIPOP GUILD, Daryl Shields, Mike Moore of CYBERWHORE, Jaymz Espinosa & Eric Padilla of NEVER, Honest Steve Stippec of BRAINSCRAPE, and many more.


OCTOBER 2012 marks the release of SOLEMN ASSEMBLY's first full length CD offering, "AFTERSHOCK". With a new lineup including Derek Mick on electronic percussion and synths, and Brandon Foster on synths and percussion, a winter tour supporting the new CD is in the works. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Solemn+Assembly">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
