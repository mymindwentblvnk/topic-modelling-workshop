Kimza International (2003 ~ )

The driving force is Kimza Masa and Kimza GT. Originally they were based in Osaka but because of being bored and causing burnt-out trouble locally, the locals told them to "get out and take their music with them!", so they decided to reside near Tokyo and create TECH-LOW music. Using minimal musical instruments and relying mainly on burnt media, they have managed to create whatever comes to mind. From Frank Sinatra to hentai, they mean to cover a broad spectrum of styles.

After freaking out because of self-paranoia, Masa (as of June 2007) is no longer with KI. His reputation had a problem locally and he has decided to go on the run again. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kimza+International">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
