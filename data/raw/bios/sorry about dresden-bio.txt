Sorry About Dresden is back in action! Over the weekend of May 24 and 25, The Dres went to Kernersville, NC and began recording their next album with Mitch Easter. They will be working on it in the months to come.  If you would like to hear some live versions of the new songs, check out Sorry About Dresden Live at the dotmatrix project here on last.fm!

Sorry About Dresden have been making music as a band since 1997. The Dres have released three albums, an EP, and a bunch of tracks on 7’’s and compilations. In the old days, the Dres featured Matthew Tomich on lead bass, however, he relocated to the continent to live out a Scott Fitzgerald fantasy he’d harbored since his freshman year in high school. Now, the young John Booker has joined the group on a permanent basis. Between the two, there were a myriad of dudes who didn’t want to be in the Dres but were nice enough to play with us for a show or two. We’d thank them but there really are too many to remember. Hep, Eric, and Matty fill out the rest of the band and play the other non-bass guitar instruments. 

We have played rock music all over this country, in bars, clubs, colleges, living rooms, basements, churches, bedrooms, and occasionally outside. We envision playing more shows in other places in the coming year but those plans will be revealed when our handlers deem it appropriate.
