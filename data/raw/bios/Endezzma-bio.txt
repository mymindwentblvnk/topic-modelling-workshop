Black Metal band from HÃ¸nefoss, Norway, formed autumn 2005 after Sorgar decided to reanimate his former project Dim Nagel (formed in 1993), albeit changing the band name along the way. Reportedly, a couple of Dim Nagel demo songs might find their way in re-recorded form onto the Endezzma debut album.
