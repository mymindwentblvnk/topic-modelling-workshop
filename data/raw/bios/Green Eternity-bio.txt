"Green Eternity is all about being as dirty and grimy as possible."

Green Eternity are a two piece recording project, formed by friends Richard and Oliver. Inspired by the aural awesomeness that is Doom. With an aim to make sludgy music, in the vein of bands like Electric Wizard, Eyehategod and Orange Goblin, they set about writing and recording some tracks. 

They recently finished their Demo, simply named P.O.S. . It is available as a free download from several sources. 

After recieving mixed reviews, the duo took their criticisms into account and began to write some new tracks, and reworked some of their older ones. They are working towards a new album, which is currently untitled.
