Goldsmith was formed in 1981 by Pez after leaving fellow Cumbrian NWOBHM band Bitches Sin. The original band was a 3 piece with Glen Millihan on bass and Mike Henderson on Drums and Pez on guitars and vocals.The band became a four piece shortly after with the addition of Pete Adams on guitar. The band quickly recorded their first single “Life is killing me” (1982) after interest was shown from their demo cassette.Released on the Bedlam label the single is now a much sought after item and received the accolade of Geoff Barton’s single of the week in “Sounds” magazine and a wealth of rave reviews from European Nwobhm Fanzines.Goldsmith while being aligned to heavy metal due to the single and the timing, were more of a heavy rock band with anthems such as “Evil Woman” with its slow build to a blistering guitar solo outro. They could really rock though, check out “Give me your love” and “You won’t catch me” for proof of this. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Goldsmith">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
