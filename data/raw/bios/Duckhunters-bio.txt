Born in 2013 from the ashes of Öyster Union, Duckhunters spits a heavy and fuzzy sound. The band combines stoner, doom, sludge and psychedelic moods inspired by such bands as Orange Goblin, Kyuss, Kylesa, Goatsnake, Baroness or Pentagram.

 After one year of hard work, composition and identity shaping, Duckhunters realeases its first demo « Drop Dead » in 2014. With more than 30 concerts, 2015 will prove to be the year of an artistic transformation to a more sophisticated but also efficient sound. Both music and lyrics are created with a post-apocalyptic background, Duckhunters’ favourite theme since the creation of the band and common thread for the upcomping album.

 During the spring of 2015, the four musicians decide to start a crowdfuding campaign in order to fund their first EP. The latter is then recorded at Y Prod studios (Brittany, France), while Jo Riou delivers the album’s artwork. The success of the crowdfunding allows the band to record two more tracks, turning the EP into an album.

« Extinction Road » came out on November 28th 2015. The story is set in a dystopic future, defined by a dark and cold atmosphere, the only way out being a road that leads us across a doomed world. Following the album, Duckhunters released its first video clip, « Killer Croc », realised in collaboration with Peter Skull (visual artist for Night Lights Studio). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Duckhunters">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
