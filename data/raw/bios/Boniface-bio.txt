1. Boniface (AKA Micah Visser) named his band after the Winnipeg neighbourhood where he grew up. Writing alone in his bedroom, Visser forged a sound that would take an indie sensibility and make it glisten.  His debut single “I Will Not Return As A Tourist” sets out his stall: a song that presses quiet lyrical introspection against a furious pop swell, that is at moments frayed and wild and at others immense and gleaming. The line ‘I will not return as a tourist’ is a resolution to be more active in your own life and wanting to be a participant and not an observer.”

2. Bruce Boniface, a.k.a Boniface (born 5 June 1981) was born on the Seychelles Islands and started his music career at the age of 3. He had one Christmas and two studio albums by the age of 5. Boniface and his family moved to England when he was 6 years old. After a short break at age 13, Boniface resumed developing his musical skills and dancing techniques. Among his influences are Michael Jackson, Boyz II Men, Babyface, Lionel Richie and Usher. In 2002 he reached #25 on the UK Singles Chart with a single entitled "Cheeky". He later toured with Destiny’s Child in the UK and across Europe in 2002 and 2003. He was signed to Virgin Records in July 2006.
