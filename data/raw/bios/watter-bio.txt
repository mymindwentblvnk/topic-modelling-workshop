Watter is a new trio made up of close friends and collaborators whose collective pedigree reads like a desert island list of must-haves in experimental rock musicians. Multi-instrumentalists Zak Riles (Grails) and Tyler Trotter are anchored by legendary drummer Britt Walford (Slint, Evergreen) on six genre-defying pieces of monolithic mood music. For Riles and Trotter, it's a chance to dig deeper into the sandbox in which Grails have sculpted many mercurial masterpieces in recent years; for Walford, it's the opportunity to play a substantial role in a new active band for the first time in nearly twenty years.

Written, recorded, and produced entirely in the group's collective studios in Louisville, KY, debut album This World is a stunning combination of heady psychedelic rock, vintage cinematic New Age explorations, and sinister Krautrock, performed with seemingly endless stamina. Born out of many late-night jam sessions, many songs also feature fellow Louisville icons – Rachel Grimes (Rachel's) provides several of the album's most sublime moments, and The For Carnation's Todd Cook lays the heavy, bass-driven foundation for the penultimate epic, "Seawater" – as well as a subtle, sinister contribution from legendary King Crimson bassist Tony Levin.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Watter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
