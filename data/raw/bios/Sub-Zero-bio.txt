Sub-Zero is the solo project of Adelino Afonso born in 1984 in Coimbra (Portugal). Since his childhood, Adelino always had a strong relation with music. At 13 he got his first electric guitar and with it the need to create his own music.

In the year 2000 Adelino started going to techno and psy trance parties. There he found his electronic musical language. He started Djing and experimenting with various sequencers such as “E-jay” and “Fruity loops” with which he learned the basics of electronic music production.

During the year 2002 Adelino joined forces with his friend Mario Rodrigues (Droidbeatz) and created a project that is now known as “Poizon”, one of the most promising acts from the psy trance scene in Portugal today.
After some years of gaining musical and production knowledge, Adelino created the project that was originaly known as “Reset”, as a way to explore different psychedelic fields. His music is defined by low rolling fat basslines, classical psychedelic synth work, intricate percussive rhythms, imaginative noises from synthesizers and lots, lots more ...

Sub-Zero joined PsynOpticz Productions in 2010 spreading his unique & driving psychedelic trance to greatful dancefloors on distant shores.
