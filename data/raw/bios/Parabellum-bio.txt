4) PARABELLUM forge elements of early SAINT VITUS / CROWBAR like sludge with a driving force similar to that of CELTIC FROST along with a dose of chaos reminiscent of the legendary ACID BATH to create their own brand of Swamp Metal. Fueled by the entrancing - chameleon like vocals of front man Shane Reneaux, the skin crawling riffage of Jeremiah Hatcher and Jason Davis, Todd the Viking's destructive low end and the sledge hammer chops of drummer Ben Poffenberger, PARABELLUM utilize violent hooks, hypnotic grooves and mind altering blasts of death to deliver a thunderous, blasphemic, subversive message that borders on insanity.
