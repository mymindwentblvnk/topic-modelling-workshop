Hailing from Dublin and Wicklow, Solar Bears formed in early 2009. The band consists of John Kowalski and Rian Trench who met at sound engineering college. Sharing a love of world cinema, their music combines a number of different influences ranging from electronica to film composers like Ennio Morricone and George Delerue. Their sound is a mix of programming, acoustic instruments, synths and vintage tape machines. The freeform approach of their writing and recording lends itself to varying tones and colours. Tracks often have differing sound sources from each other creating a unique musical experience. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Solar+Bears">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
