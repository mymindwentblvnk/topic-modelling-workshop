Souldivider was formed in 1999 in Karlstad, Sweden. In 2000, they signed a 3 album record deal with the now disbanned Canadian label 12th Planet Music. In 2001, they Released "The Big relax" which was by some magazines reviewed as a fresh grain

If it was 1976 Sweden's Souldivider would be selling out arenas worldwide. With their 70's rock vibe and "hit" writing style they would be a best selling band and all over AM rock radio if they had just been around a few decades sooner.(Scott Myers - Ultimate Metal dec.2002)

in the So called Stonerrockgenre. Other publications just considered Soul Divider to be just another duck in the pond

It's not that Souldivider plays boring music, because a couple of the songs are quite good, it's just that the band doesn't do anything too exciting either (Peter Johnston - Deadtime Magazine jan. 2003)

Stonerrock was a genre that by that time was on its decline according to record sales. Bands sounding like Kyuss Fu Manchu had been popping up for a steady ten year period by then and Souldivider was no exception. For the 2003 release of "Supersound City" they called in Toronto based Nick Blagona to help them out with a fresh sound, Blagona who had in the 70´ and 80´ worked with artists like Deep Purple Def Leppard and David Bowie. The album was a big step-up for the band and they embarked on a monthly long tour in North America. Souldivider also contributed with soundtrack to at least 4 extreme sport videos and are in some skate and snowboard communities considered as a cult band. In one episode of the American stunt show Viva La BamSouldivider's "Anymore" is being played while skate stunts are being performed. The band took a break in 2004 and at least 3 of the members are now found in other Swedish metal bands.
