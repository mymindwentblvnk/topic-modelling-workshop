The band started in middle of 2002 in Curitiba (Brazil) and was created by Réu (vochaos), Emerson (drums - also member of Necrotério - deathgrindgore from Curitiba-BRAZIL), Diogore (bass) and Polaco (guitars). In that time the band was more into grind/crustcore and had not recorded any stuff. Horrific Disturbance has just played one gig in that time with hardcore acts like Morte, Asceta and D.R.R. Some months later Polaco and Diogo left the band and we have found our identity into a heavier and tight grind sound, all because the (anti) musical afinity between the demented psichopats Réu and Emersom and now with other mentally affected freak called Gerson on guitars (that also plays on Fornication - brutal death metal from Curitiba-BRAZIL). Our main intention now is aterrorize all innocents and spread our dirty, tight, fast and perverse GRINDCORE , with some touches from death metal, having in mind influences from bands like Agathocles, Regurgitate, Blood, Rot, old Napalm, etc. Lyrics talks about the hate for the social/politic system of today, the pre-established "society" image and conceiving by a negative form the human existence itself. A gig happened with the actual line-up with participation of our brother Hernan (that also plays bass on Fornication), with the bands Necrotério, Total Fucking Destruction and Vomitation. The only stuff we have in hands now is 7 songs recorded at Audiohead Studio on Curitiba. In this recording we had the special guest Alexandre Antoniutti (ex-Hierarchical Punishment - grindcore from Santos-BRAZIL) singing some backing vocals in some tracks
