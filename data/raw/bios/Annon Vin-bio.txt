Featuring Tom Brenneis (bass/vocals), Erik Grosch (guitars), and Use Ruppel (drums), Germany's mysterious heavy metal ensemble Annon Vin has ties to the equally secretive Mekong Delta, whose leader, Ralf Hubert, produced their only LP, 1996's A New Gate. Taking a twisted view onto the progressive metal template (if there is such a thing), the album (along with, to a lesser degree, a 1993 EP entitled Higher Spheres) married extremely technical, aggressive heavy metal guitar playing with lush vocal harmonies. This, and the fact that it featured a cover of "Mr. Roboto," led some observers to describe Annon Vin as Voivod jamming with Styx. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Annon+Vin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
