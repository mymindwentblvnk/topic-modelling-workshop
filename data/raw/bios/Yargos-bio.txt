Yargos is a progressive metal band/project created way back in 1973 by Wieland "Wielo" Hofmeisterin (ex-Time Machine), but the project didn't last nor fulfil any album. Then, in 2001, Yargos came back to life and became a real band with Andrew McDermott (ex-Threshold) on vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yargos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
