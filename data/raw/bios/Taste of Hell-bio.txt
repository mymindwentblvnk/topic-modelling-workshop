Passion, integrity, talent and friendship: here are the principles that drive the Metal band Taste of Hell, founded in Metz, France, at the end of 2006 by Gabriel (guitar), Cyril (guitar) and Julien (bass), soon joined by Thomas on drums. One single goal: to share their experience in order to create the most powerful, inspired and honest music possible. Rather than just reproduce what does already exist, TOH presents us with a music that synthesizes the different trends that are to be found in Metal, such as Heavy, Death, Progressive, Speed and Thrash. The band finally becomes a full-force entity in January 2007 with the arrival of Vince as the embodiment of the band's voice. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Taste+Of+Hell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
