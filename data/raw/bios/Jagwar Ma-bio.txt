Jagwar Ma is an Australian psychedelic/dance band formed in Sydney in 2011, consisting of members Gabriel Winterfield (lead vocalist/guitarist), Jono Ma (synths, production, guitar), and bass guitarist/vocalist Jack Freeman (joined 2012). The band name is derived from a satirical compound of the word "jaguar" and Jono’s surname.

In 2013 Jagwar Ma signed with record labels Mom+Pop (US) Marathon Artists (EU) and Future Classic (Australia) and released their debut album "Howlin". Howlin’ received high acclaim from music press like The NME, Pitchfork and the London Times as well as praise from several iconic figures and more contemporary artists Foals and The XX, who they went on to join on tour. Now based in the UK, Jagwar Ma are currently touring "Howlin" and have begun preparation for their Sophomore album.

Jagwar Ma are the producers of some quality electronic vibes that swim through the rough terrain of yesteryear, but warps them for modern senses. ”Come Save Me” is 60s bubblegum pop crystalized into tribal neon (much like TV Girl does) and features the vocals of Gabriel Winterfield (Ghostwood), additional production from Ewan Pearson and additional percussion from Stella Mozgawa (Warpaint). ”What Love” is a slow building trance that picks up substance along the way, but still continuing the hypnotic thump.  Keep an eye/ear out for these dudes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jagwar+Ma">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
