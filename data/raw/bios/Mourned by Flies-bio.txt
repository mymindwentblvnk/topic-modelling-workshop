Mourned By Flies was founded By Erik Gristle, Greg Keenan and Skar Huwig in February of 2006 after the disintegration of their previous band eROTic. Bassist Aimee Ridriguez joined in April 2006. The band creates a brand of thrashed, industrialized style of heavy metal that they self describe as "Melody fucking Chaos."

Their first full length release, "Signs of Life," was released April 2008, and has been well received in Europe and the USA by critics and fans alike.

Mourned By Flies is currently writing for their next full length release (2011 tentatively).
