‘Just fucking express yourself.’ That’s the takeaway from Delilah Montagu’s third EP ‘Baby’. Following the release of last summer’s ‘This Is Not A Love Song’ EP, the London-based artist’s new project is a total departure from the brooding and melancholy –influenced by artists like Phoebe Bridgers, Arlo Parks, Bon Iver, St. Vincent and Lizzo. A breakup during lockdown led Delilah to reconnect with her sense of self and in doing so, she found freedom and happiness –and it’s palpable in every track.

‘I realised I was trying to be someone I’m not and trying to be ready for things I wasn’t,’ says the 23-year-old. ‘I’ve let go of all that pressure.’ The project is an exhaling release from the shackles of expectation, looking to a new chapter with hope and excitement.

As the UK embraces freedom after its year of isolation, Delilah embraces hers and fantasises over the thing we’ve been starved of most –touch. This EP, which features collaborations with BRIT-winning producer Fred again.. and Billie Eilish-approved artist Towa Bird, is a dazzling ode to intoxicating first touches, spontaneous nights out and the thrill of finding new love. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Delilah+Montagu">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
