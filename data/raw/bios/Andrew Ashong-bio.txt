Andrew Ashong, hailing from Forest Hill by way of Ghana has been titled as an essential listen by many music blogs in the past year. The Ghanaian-British artist had his first solo release on Theo Parrish’s label, Sound Signature. The title track, ‘Flowers’ won ‘Track of the Year’ at Gilles Peterson’s Worldwide Awards 2013.

Described by Paul Lester of The Guardian as "a hazy, jazzy dreamer of a young soul rebel who in his music references Roy Ayers and Shuggie Otis, Bill Withers and Marvin Gaye."

Andrew continues to spin his unrivaled collection of vinyl both old and new across the UK and internationally. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Ashong">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
