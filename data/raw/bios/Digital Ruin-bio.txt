Digital Ruin released two impressive albums in 1997 and 2000, both both melodic progressive metal albums in the mold of early-mid-period Queensryche, though with plenty of individuality to help them avoid the clone tag. The band - vocalist Matt Pacheco, guitarist Dave Souza, drummer Tim Hart and bassist Mike Keegan list a varied and eclectic mix of influences: Queen, Machine Head, Dream Theater, Marillion and Stabbing Westward. Both albums received some fine reviews and the band appeared to be on the rise in the prog metal field, but following the release of Dwelling In The Out, and the subsequent departure of vocalist Matthew Pacheco, the band underwent a substantial style change, going for a more modern, alternative metal direction. With the departure of Michael Keegan, the remaining members decided to put the name Digital Ruin to rest and continue on as Monoblok, but apparently they've decided to return to their roots, with the Dwelling quartet back together and working on new material (presumably in their original style) for 2007.
