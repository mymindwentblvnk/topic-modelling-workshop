Until Death Overtakes Me is the ambient funeral doom project of Belgian musician Stijn van Cauter. UDOM, as the project is often called, brings unconpromisingly slow funeral doom metal, mixed with bleak ambient. The music is based on crushing riffs, timpani, keyboards, deep growls and wailing lead guitar. As is usual for the subgenre, the songs tend to be very long, mostly over 10 minutes, sometimes over 20 or 30.
