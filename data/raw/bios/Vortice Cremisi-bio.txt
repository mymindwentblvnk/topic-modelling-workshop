VORTICE CREMISI or 'Crimson Vortex' is a stoner rock band formed in 1992 in Italy. The current line-up is as follows: Giovanni Cifaldi (Crimson John) - Vocals/Guitar; Simone Cecconi (Simon Checkone) - Bass; Massimo Di Prenda (Max Vortex) - Drums. They describe themselves as "Heavy-Weighted-Vegetarian-Stoner-Guitar Rock" on their Myspace page.

Their first demo was recorded in 1995 and because it turned out so well, it was officially reissued by the well known Italian label 'Vacation House,' and distributed abroad by Helter Skelter. In mid-1999 Vortice Cremisi were picked up to be part of the important "Cookery Course" 2x7 vinyl compilation, which included 4 of the most outstanding Italian stoner rock bands; 'Thats all Folks', 'Acajou', 'Hogwash' & Vortice, obviously. A few months later, Vortice Cremisi were asked from the Italian label Black Widow to contribute a track to a Blue Cheer CD tribute (which included seminal acts such as 'Pentagram') so they agreed to contribute with their own vision of how a Blue Cheer song could have been done. The bands live shows generally remain in Europe. Some of the most important dates were the 1998 East European/Polish tour and the Rumble Fish Festival in Italy together with most of the top names from the new Italian "stoner rock" scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vortice+Cremisi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
