Something Beautiful (SoB) is Chicago's premiere gothic-progressive metal band. Comprised of three members, Dale Tippett, Jr. (guitar/vocals), Justin Smith (bass/vocals), and Eric Kummerer (drums/vocals) bring to life a musical experience that recalls Dream Theater, Danzig, Fear Factory and Tool. From the demanding epics (Dreams About Your Skin, The Ending) to the headbangers (Daughter of God, Heresies and Blasphemies), SoB does it all with intensity and finesse. Something Beautiful's two full-length albums States of Being (2006) and Songs About Angels (2009) are available on iTunes and the band's official website www.denythepain.com. You can keep up with the band by following on Twitter, friending on Facebook, and subscribing to the band's podcast, the Something Beautiful Radio Network, available for free on iTunes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Something+Beautiful">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
