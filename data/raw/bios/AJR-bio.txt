AJR is a New York City-based indie pop band composed of brothers Adam, Jack, and Ryan Met (born Metzger). The band is a DIY pop group who write, produce, and mix their own material in the living room of their Chelsea apartment. Their music style has been described as "eclectic", combining elements of pop, barbershop, electronic, and dubstep music. They have opened for Demi Lovato, Hoodie Allen and the Wanted. In Summer 2014 the band went on tour with Lindsey Stirling.

There is no band, no song, no video, no sound, that is more “now” than AJR. The band — three brothers born and raised in New York City — has achieved a startling quick level of success with “I’m Ready,” a buoyant electro-pop single that’s taking off on social media. The numbers: over 1.5M views on YouTube, thousands of singles sold each week, features in Billboard, the NY Post, and on MTV. Festival performances in front of 10,000+ people.

AJR started to become popular with their track "Weak", which they wrote in a few hours and released 16th September 2016, that was made Platinum in 5 countries, including the US, and Gold in 4 more. It has more than 500 million Spotify streams.
They followed this up with their album The Click, released 9th June 2017, featuring the single Weak as well as "Drama" and "Sober Up", the latter of which features Rivers Cuomo. The album reached no. 1 on Mediabase's alternative singles chart the following year. An extended "Deluxe" version of the album was released 21st September 2018, including an acoustic version of Pretender, a track they worked on with Steve Aoki and Lil Yachty.

30th January 2019 saw the release of "100 Bad Days", which was performed on Jimmy Kimmel on 11th March (coinciding with the release of another single, "Birthday Party"), and got included on Taylor Swift's "Playlist by ME!" in May of that year. Dear Winter was released 5th April, and got a sequel, Dear Winter 2.0, on 25th October.
Neotheater was their next album. It was debuted 26th April 2019 and was possibly where the band got noticed the most, hitting number one on Billboard's Top Rock and Top Alternative charts, and 8th on the Top 200 Albums. It featured 100 Bad Days, Birthday Party, and Dear Winter.

"Bang!" came next on 13th February 2020, at first intended for a Deluxe version of Neotheater, but later integrated into their next album OK Orchestra. "Bummerland" was then released 31st August 2020. 22nd of December 2020 saw the release of My Play, 2 days after they announced OK Orchestra as an album. Then 17th February 2021 saw the release of "Way Less Sad".
OK Orchestra, often teased as OKO, was released 26th March 2021, featuring these 4 singles and a track with the Blue Man Group. Merchandise was release on the 23rd March, and a game called OKO World was released on the 21st. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/AJR">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
