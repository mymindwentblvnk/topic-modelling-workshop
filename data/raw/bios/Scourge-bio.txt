4) The history of the Boston-based metal band Scourge is a long and twisting tale.  Please enjoy these fun facts about Scourge!

-Scourge formally began when Jeremy Pastrick and David Lee met at college in 2003 as bright-eyed young adults. During the fall and winter of 2003 they jammed on and off and started forming songs that would later become the band known as Scourge.

-The early years of Scourge were mostly uneventful. The band recorded several low-quality demos with numerous line up changes sprinkled throughout.

-Scourge at one point was a six-piece band, and after ceasing to have a keyboard player in the band, they remained a five-piece for a number of years.

-After four different drummers, two bass players, one vocalist and four keyboard players, Scourge is now a four-piece band.

-The upcoming release of the 'God Is Not Here' EP will mark the first professional Scourge recording.
