Call O' Da Wild was a classic Soul Assassins members, consisting of two members Baron Ricks & Angelo Campanioni.
In 1996 DJ Muggs was producing for a Call O Da Wild's LP to be released on Sony. After hearing the album, Sony wanted something more Commerical since they were having so much success with Cypress Hill, Fugees and Kris Kross. While going back to re-record the album, Call O Da Wild, broke up. Leaving the project in limbo until now. Now Soul Assassins Dot Com has the pleasure to bring you two tracks from that album, Andrews Ave is the first of those tracks, Urban Wilderness is the second of those tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Call+O%27+Da+Wild">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
