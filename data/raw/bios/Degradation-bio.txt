1)DEGRADATION was formed in 1996 and has reached an enormous status in the european Hardcore-Scene. Their first official release was a 7" on Undertone Records and a Compilation on Siton Records. Since all members were constantly involved in other bands such as EYEBALL, UPRIGHT or IN TOO DEEP, it took quite a long time to release a second 7‚Äù, this time on Not Just Words records from Holland in the end of 2001 and shortly after that the first full length "Homeward Bound" on their homebase recordlabel Competition Records from Germany. The music is fast, raw and aggressiv and can possibly be compared to early 80s HC. DEGRADATION is often compared with bands like SSD, DYS and also later JUDGE and BROTHERHOOD. DEGRADATION has played whole europe throughout the years and is toured as much as they could do to promote the LP/CD on Competition records. Shortly after, DEGRADATION started to live a silent life. Not dead, but not really alive either ...
