There are two bands named Calwell, one from Finland that plays black metal and other one desicriped below...

Often described as an energetically charged onslaught of hardcore, Caldwell's innovative mix of punk, hardcore, metal and emotive rock has been gradually winning over fans in the underground for the last few years. On "Accidental Renovation" the band's debut release, Panama City Florida's Caldwell, join a long tradition of Indianola Records' melodic hardcore. To capture the proper sound to disc, the band tracked the record at Earthsound Recordings, a studio associated with Indianola Records since its inception and who has worked with such popular bands as Evergreen Terrace and Across Five Aprils. From the first chord strum to the last crashing breakdown on "Accidental Renovation", the band pours it on at a furious pace while never losing the knack for melody or a good chorus. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Caldwell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
