Actionslacks is a rock band based in the United States. Yes, the country. Because while 2 of the band - singer-guitarist Tim Scanlin and lead guitarist Chuck Lindo - reside in the greater Los Angeles area, bassist Ross Murray lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, and drummer Marty Kelly hangs his hat in Waterville, Maine.

It's been a long, strange trip for this outfit, which formed from the ashes of various collegiate bar bands in and around Berkeley, CA in 1994. The band has since released 7 albums on 5 different national labels, had 12 different members, logged over 50,000 miles, played hundreds of shows, contributed music to numerous film and television projects, and generally endured all manner of threats and pitfalls that haunt any band who dares to shoulder the Mantle of Rock. However, some things have never changed: Kelly on the skins, Scanlin on the wires/mics, and an unswerving dedication to and obsession with writing Songs. For Actionslacks the melody is key. It doesn't always have to be pretty, but if you don't have one, you don't have a song.

The penultimate album, Kids with Guitars, was an EP the band produced over the course of seven days in May of 2008, following a year of songwriting, demoing, and practicing (though never in the same room).  It was initially released on-line (http://slacksaction.com/) on a pay-what-you-want basis, but is now available through iTunes and similar digital retailers or, more recently, as a CD release available through CDBaby.

The self-titled Actionslacks was recorded in mid-November 2009 and while it was slated for a Spring 2010 release, delays resulted in a release in early-October 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Actionslacks">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
