Deist started in 2006 with founding members Emil(guitar) and Kirk(guitar). They soon after picked up Andy on bass. Deist although having a very strong guitar and bass section, still would be on the search for a full-time vocalist and drummer. They decided to work on seperate projects while still searching for the final members to complete Deist. Finally in late 2008 they came across Eddie(drums). Eddie was a perfect fit for the style Deist was going for. Along with meeting Eddie they found Kevin who was interested in doing vocals for a death metal band. And Deist was complete. So far one demo has been released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
