They formed in 1990 by Luiz Oliveira (Lead Guitar and Backing vocals), Edu Simões (Bass), Miguel DeLaet (Guitar and Lead Vocals), Fernando Marques (Drums) and Adolfo Mendonça (Keys).

The band received great attention of the specialized media after the release of their first full lenght album entitled "The Prayer". The reviews in magazines, websites and some TV Shows were great and the album was sold in around 8 countries.
The Prayer was produced by Zuzo Mounssauer, a great bass player, well known and very respected.

The Photography of this and the following EP was made by  André Peniche from "The Chupacabra Witnesses" and "Sofa wi-fi".

The second album is actually their second EP (There is the extremely rare EP called "Dark Omen" from 2000).
