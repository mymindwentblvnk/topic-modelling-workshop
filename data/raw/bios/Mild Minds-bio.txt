Benjamin David first started creating music at the young age of 13 in his home of Australia, and has since found himself as the creative force behind several successful artist projects. Now, with Mild Minds, David has been able to find solace in returning to his dance music roots, creating a project without pressure and expectation. The result is authentic and unrestricted.
Mild Minds was immediately signed to ODESZA's label Foreign Family Collective alongside Aussie mates RÜFÜS DU SOL, as well as Big Wild, Jai Wolf, Golden Features, Kasbo, and more. The first time his unreleased music debuted was at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Sydney.
After having a momentous epiphany in Japan, David was immediately compelled to head back to his current home in the states and get started creating music from his new found perspective. His first EP SWIM was written, explored, and created between Joshua Tree and Lake Arrowhead. He states, "I wanted to do something that was completely 'me' in that moment. After being used to working with songs that had elaborate visions over long periods of time, it was nice to make music simply as it came out. Without overthinking it, without pausing or questioning the process like I was used to.”
With the release of SWIM, David created a simultaneously dance-y and introspective project, painting a nuanced story atop of melancholic melodies and lo-fi house influenced beats. The EP garnered over 1 million Spotify plays, with ford., Cabu, and Daedelus on remix duties for various singles. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mild+Minds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
