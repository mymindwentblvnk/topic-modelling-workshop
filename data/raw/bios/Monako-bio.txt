From Hamburg to Montreal. From melodrama to lust for life. Monako is a wave that's breaking. The sound of a world that's spinning, no matter what. Violent yet soothing. Itâ€™s the longing for a bittersweet blow to the face. The funk of Rock'n'Roll. 3 guitars, countless effects, a bass and drums provide a sonic landscape in which a voice, tormented by earthly doubts is accompanied by its transcendent counterpart that only enters your consciousness when you let go of rationality. Monako is, above all: The groove and the feels, the sensual melancholia slowly making its way out of the trap. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Monako">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
