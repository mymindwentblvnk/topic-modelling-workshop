DJ Zeph, has been a tenacious disciple of music since 1982, starting off as part of a breakdancing crew from his hometown of Santa Cruz, Ca. Soon after, the eminent Kut Masta Murt took Zeph under his wing and often invited him into the studio. From that point on, Zeph began to concentrate on his skills as a DJ.

After aquiring a degree in Audio Production from San Francisco State University and a tenure at the university's radio station, KSFS, Zeph had become a prominent artist from the depths of the Bay Area talent pool. Now, as he steps in the spotlight, DJ Zeph reigns as one of the top Bay Area DJ's, and rightly so.

Inspired by everyone from Public Enemy, Stevie Wonder, Jungle Brothers to Bill Laswell, Zeph's sound is musically daring and pleasingly unique. Equally celebrated as a producer, engineer, and turntablist, DJ Zeph's career is on the steady rise. The momentum has continued with Zeph taking home the honor of "Best DJ/Turntablist" at the SF Weekly Music Awards in 2002. He now sits firmly alongside Little Brother, Wildchild, and GE-OLOGY as an Urb Magazine Next 100 artist for 2003.
