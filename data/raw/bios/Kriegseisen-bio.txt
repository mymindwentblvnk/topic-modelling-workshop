Kriegseisen, [actually: The Arms of War; the name is in German] a Polish black metal band established in 2004  by Ast (bass), Nilg (vocal), Orlock (guitar) and Azghal (drums). Kriegseisen's music can be described as fast, powerfull and raw black metal. Their musical influences  are: Darkthrone, Mayhem, Marduk, Keep of Kalessin, Dissection and Dark Funeral, Vesania. All of Kriegseisen's musicians commited previously in various local black metal bands.  During September 2005, the band was reinforced by a new guitarist - Golik. This change in the band's line up was crucial for band's activity. New musical inspirations and so called 'fresh blood' resulted in writing many powerfull-sounding, technical tracks. The year 2006 was the most laborious in the bandâ€™s history. They played a set of gigs in Poland, during which they performed their new material and in new,  stabilized line-up. At the beginning of May 2006, Kriegseisen has recorded their first demo material named 'Against Lies and Betrayal' containing a good portion of pure black metal. Currently Kriegseisen is focused on promoting their new material, that is going to be recorded soon.
