Abadden is a Thrash Metal band releasing one full length album, although as of 2020, members have since created a new band Must Kill

Abadden are a fast growing thrash/heavy metal band from the pits of dunstable. With the desire to make and play music Dan, Pat, Don and John formed together to do just that. Dan has big thrash/heavy metal influences, Patrick brings a bit of hard rock/progressive and heavy metal to our songs, and Don has experience of playing Punk/metal/ska/Blues. John Blunt is our punk kid with influences from Blues/funk/Punk/Ska and Metal. I think you'd be surprised how many different genres and styles are thrown into our tracks.

Abadden are set out to make a name for themselves, to write great music and to be remembered for putting on a great live performance.
