diSEMBOWELMENT were a death/doom band that were an incredible force upon the Melbourne underground metal scene in the very early 90s. They performed a unique style of doom metal that is often credited to have assisted in the spawning of the Funeral Doom movement that followed worldwide in years following their end.

In early 2010, a tribute band featuring half of the original members began playing shows under the name d.USK. They brought the sheer intensity, brutality and ambience of the aforementioned band back into the fray. They then decided to change their name to Inverloch, and made their debut performance under that name at Homage to Darkness on February 11th 2012 at The Prague in Thornbury.

As of summer 2016, they have released the EP Dusk | Subside (2012) and the LP Distance | Collapsed (2016), both to wide critical acclaim. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inverloch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
