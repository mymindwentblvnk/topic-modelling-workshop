Greifenstein is the one man band of Arkan von Greifenstein. The music is old school Black Metal with very few keyboards and programmed drums. The vocals are fairly high and very aggressive. So far one demo has been released and another release is planned for the end of the year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Greifenstein">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
