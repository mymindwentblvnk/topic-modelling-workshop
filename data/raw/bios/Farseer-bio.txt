Scottish power metal act 'Farseer' are a 5 piece unit on a mission to bring you a 7 string metal guitar assault featuring furious beats whilst retaining the catchy vocal melodies commonplace to the genre.

The origins of Farseer date back to early 2008 under the union of Dave Bisset, David Connolly & Jon Stewart. After several lineup configurations the band settled with Bisset taking on lead vocal duties, David and Jon on Guitars and employing Joe MacGregor (ex-Alba Gu Brath) & Alan Robinson (ex-Alba Gu Brath) respectively on bass and drums.

Despite only being around for a short time, Farseer have played numerous shows including support slots for Sabaton (Swe), Grailknights (Ger), Beholder (Eng) and Freedom Call (Ger).

The band are set to release an E.P. entitled 'Chthonic Visions' early next year. Meanwhile they are also seeking support slots for similar, touring artists.
