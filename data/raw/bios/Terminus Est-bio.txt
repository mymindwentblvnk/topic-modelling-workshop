Band
Edward Gryn : Guitars/Voices
Hannes Grossmann : Session Drumming
Olivier Pinard : Bass

Terminus Est is born with the idea of mixing the playing style and influences of both Hannes Grosmann (Blotted Science/Alkaloid, former Necrophagist/Obscura) and Olivier Pinard (Cryptopsy/Neuraxis..) with Edward Gryn's own influences and riffs.

The result of this collaboration is a crushing progressive extreme metal project with a debut album scheduled for 2015. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Terminus+Est">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
