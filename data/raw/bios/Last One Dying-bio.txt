Last One Dying – a gathering of musicians hailing from 3 different bands. An experiment gone out of control…

This project started out as a harmless and fun pastime and was intended to be a balance to the regular band activities. Soon, it developed into an independently thinking and erratic creature unable to stop gorging.

Shortly after, this monster caught producer Patrick “Pedi” Karwatka’s (worked on productions such as Such A Surge, Liquido, Two Dollar Haircut and Recbow, among others) attention, which led to the recording of the first 4 songs after having had only 6 band practices to write and develop them. The result of this collaboration is an EP filled with incredible fire and intensity, allowing L.O.D to walk their way through hell without any trouble. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Last+One+Dying">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
