Descending from Chicago's northern reaches, instrumental mutants Lorus are back with their new record, a wild maelstrom called Byzantine. Pillaging their way through rock, sludge, prog and more, the band pushes the eclecticism of '07s Deluge to extremes. Lorus' core of guitarist Dylan Burr, bassist Chris Brown and keyboardist Alan Lawrence have been pounding away for four years, growing gutsier with each show. Lorus are rock 'n' roll nomads, only at home when they're on the move. Across Byzantine's 11 tracks, they are always shifting, embracing complexity without sacrificing their visceral punch. The opener, "The Cormorant," begins with an inhuman squeal before launching into an ominous, driving assault. On "Asootee", the band hypnotically blasts back around again and again like a snake swallowing its own tail. There is an untamed, freewheeling feel to songs, a refusal to sit still or satisfy simple expectations. From the lounge-y breakdown of "Abattoir" to the dark swing of "Trip for Biscuits," Lorus plant their feet firmly on uneven ground and dare you to join them as the earth opens beneath you. Byzantine is about shaping chaos into a strange new clarity (see the cinematic build of "Honeysuckle" and the snarling "Beast" for proof). It√≠s an intense kick to the face, but hey, maybe that's what you need.
