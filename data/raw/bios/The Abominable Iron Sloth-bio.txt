This is a doom metal / sludge band out of Sacramento, CA, United States. Formed in 2004, the band was signed to Goodfellow records and disbanded in 2006 midway through a UK tour. The band reformed in 2007 to commence recording on a second release. Their sound can be likened to a doom version of Will Haven.

The band hit difficulties and announced they had officially disbanded after the lead singer's loss of financial support while on tour in England. After help from their fans the band decided to record a second release under the original moniker, The Indomitable Iron Sloth. The name then changed back to the Abominable Iron Sloth sometime in 2008.   

The 2nd release was due to just be an EP but after many hold ups and complications Godfrey pushed ahead with writing and created their second full length album. "The ID Will Overcome" was released  through Black Market Activities on April 27th 2010.

Members (as in their debut album):
