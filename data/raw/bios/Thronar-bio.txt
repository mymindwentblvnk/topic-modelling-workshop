Thronar was a atmospheric black metal/ folk band from Arnhem, The Netherlands. They formed in 1996 as Cerberus, before changing their name to Thronar in 2002. Musically, they blend viking metal, traces of folk and melodic interludes with black metal atmosphere. The band split up in 2009 shortly after the departure of Reamon Bloem.
