The youngest of two sisters and a brother, Chelsy “Márcia Costa” Shantel was born in Portugal of African descendent parents from Angola.  Influenced by one of her older sisters, Chelsy’s passion for singing started at the age of six and later on began singing at family gatherings and school parties.  

During a show in Aula Magna in 2006, Chelsy met Nelson Freitas; known as one of the best producers, singers and composers in the Zouk music industry.  Her talent did not go unnoticed and Nelson, also part owner of Miss Jane Records, was not hesitant in making her a new member of the Ghetto Zouk Music/Miss Jane Records family.  

Her debut album was released in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chelsy+Shantel">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
