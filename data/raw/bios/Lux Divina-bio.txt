LUX DIVINA Is a poetic concept of all darkened Nature of our imagination. With deep feeling and passion we write our songs. LUX DIVINA's tribute towards the weeping of the Mother Earth's spirit. A melancholy anthem against the disease of the modern man and the religions that dominate it. Our Sound is simple, atmospheric and extreme. Under the sign of paganism, we walk along the years, find an attitude front the life, attitude of respect and recovering of old forgotten values by the modern men, who are inside the ravenous mass homogeneity. Values based on the individuality, respect and proud before the wild Mother Nature, front the throne of self freedom. A poetics based on the ancestor’s deeds, their old beliefs, traditions and cults, Their wisdom based on the Nature's throne and all the sensations that she produce..., Woodlands and Mountains, Rivers and Seas, the Night and the Cosmos, the mysticism of the elements from Beltaine to Samhain. Worship and sacrifice to Nature under the rite to Noctiluca.
