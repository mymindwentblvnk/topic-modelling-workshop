Crystal Age was a death metal band formed by the former Ceremonial Oath vocalist / guitar player Oscar Dronjak. They recorded a cover of Metallica's "Damage Inc." for the 1994 Black Sun Records tribute album "Metal Militia" before releasing their debut album the following year. Later on HammerFall became the top priority and Crystal Age was put to rest.

The album â€˜Far Beyond Divine Horizons was recorded, mixed and produced by Crystal Age and Fredrik Nordstrom At Studio Fredman in 1995. Cover artwork was made by Kristian Wahlin. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crystal+Age">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
