Bass and drums pairing. Canadian two piece from Kingston, Ontario who signed to the now defunct TAG record label. 

Members were Mike O'Neill and Dave Ullrich. O'Neill has gone on to record solo albums. Ullrich founded Zunior.com which sells independent music in DRM-free MP3 format. 

In 2007, Ullrich and O'Neill reformed the band to record a version of "Dope Fiends and Booze Hounds" for the Rheostatics' tribute album The Secret Sessions.

Note that there is also a British heavy metal band called The Inbreds who released the album 'Groove Drenched Warfare'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Inbreds">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
