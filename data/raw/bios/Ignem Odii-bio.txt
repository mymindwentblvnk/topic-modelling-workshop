Officially created in the beginning of 2007 by ST Grey, I.C, Y and SV – the four and unique members – Ignem Odii, a band from the suburb of Paris, France delivers a Black Metal drawing from the 80’s bands, extreme Metal scene, but also from different musical movements (Sludge, Classical, Old School Rock’n’roll).

They completely compose, record and mix their songs. The first demo « Adversa Fraternitas – Prologus » (Limited to 1000 copies), finished since September 2008, alternates between the works of 2007 and those of 2008, more researched and deeper.

From a dynamic Black Metal with archaic themes, Ignem Odii is evolving to a music axed on metaphysics, theology, cosmology, and takes some esoteric and religious ways that help formulate new theories.
It’s a philosophy that owns its basis and dogmas, its knowledge and inaccessible transcendental awareness.
