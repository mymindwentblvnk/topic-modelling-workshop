Additional notes
Corpus Necromanthum is born of his terminology in Latin, the topics are the torture of already dead, like that as the contact with them from the inframundo.
Also they are mentioned of metaphorical form, the dark and perverse side of every human being and of the world in which it lives, leading it to committing acts of pure violence against if same and against any religious deity.
Buy their stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!
