In a world of over-developed complexity, the intelligent people urge
to go back to their roots and simplicity. With no artificial worries, recharged,
they can go, demanding new horizons. Mechanization and
digitalization, the murder of the individuality and sharp thought, the
constant bombing attacks, the diverse linguistic ethnicities… welcome
to «TAO», CRUSHING SUN’s debut album. A METAL album, with no
additives, posts or suffixes. Forget for a while trends, labels, categorizations
and styles… enjoy the music with most of the senses you
can use to perceive it and, we guarantee, you won’t regret entering
the TAO world.
Crushing Sun was formed in late 2003 when a group of friends – Bruno
Silva on vocals, Paulo Lopes on guitar, Rui Pinto on bass and Marco
Silva on drums – first started writing some songs together. During the
next five years the band managed to play more than 60 shows both
in Portugal and Spain, sharing the stage with bands like Mnemic and
Ophiolatry and developing their own take on modern metal brutality.
In that period, they have recorded two demos and established themselves
as one of the most solid and vicious live acts in the current
Portuguese underground scene.
Come 2008 and they released the now infamous «Bipolar» split CD
with friends E.A.K., which marked their first link with Major Label
Industries and granted the band a new slap of live shows, solo and
sharing the stage with too many international names to name them
all. The last half of 2009 was basically spent recording their debut
fill-length, «TAO», which is being released early June on MLI. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crushing+Sun">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
