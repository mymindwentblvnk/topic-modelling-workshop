Étienne Daho (born January 14, 1956 in Oran) is a French singer who has racked up an extensive number of synth-driven and rock-influenced pop hits in the French-speaking world since 1981. He sings in a low, whispery voice somewhat akin to Leonard Cohen or Benjamin Biolay, and his music videos established his innovative and creative flair visually. He cites Francoise Hardy as one of his main influences.

He is best known in Britain for his appearence on the number 11 Saint Etienne hit single "He's On The Phone", which is an English-language adaptation of his 1984 French-language hit "Weekend à Rome". He also collaborated with Saint Etienne on the Resurrection EP, his album Eden, and his single "Le Premier Jour", itself based on the track "Ready or Not" from Sarah Cracknell's 1997 solo album "Lipslide".

His duets and collaborations both on stage and in the studio with other artists have been extensive and he has worked with the likes of Chris Isaak, Marianne Faithfull, Elli Medeiros, Astrud Gilberto, Vanessa Daou, the Swingle Singers, and more. Most recently, he released a duet ("If") with Charlotte Gainsbourg in 2004.

His 1996 album Eden displayed a diverse array of electronic-oriented songs that included downtempo ballads, drum 'n' bass-influenced tracks, and HiNRG dance.

After a 20-track greatest hits compilation (Singles) in 1998, Corps & armes in 2000 saw Daho return to a more orchestral sound fuelled by traditional instruments: piano, acoustic guitar, horns.

Daho shifted gears once again for his 2004 album Réévolution, which featured a guitar-heavy rock sound.

In 2012, he produced and composed songs for French comedian/singer Lou Doillon for her first album  Places. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/%C3%89tienne+Daho">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
