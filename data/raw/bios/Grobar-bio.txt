Grobar is a Swedish project that embraces a dark Erisatanic world view and uses that death life ideology to create art. He has a new album on the way (as of early 2007) and has already released an awesome DEMO called Erisatanicon with Introvert Distortion, the Swedish open-source noise site. That DEMO is noise, but noise with a set of very melancholy other sounds such as swirling tortured digital winds, beats, and an eerie voice that opens the album before the slow DOOM style guitar blasts. The DEMO is not a guitar project but Grobar has proven himself incapable of adopting a Genre. rather, he has created a layered and complex emotional album and the world awaits his new stuff. The DEMO is free for download from www.introvertdistortion.com.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grobar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
