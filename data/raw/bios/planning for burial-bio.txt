Simultaneously straddling the line between being completely nostalgic and futurist sounding, this product of a single wunderkind takes healthy obsessions with certain influences and filters them through a droning, gloomy spyglass that evokes only the most concrete blues (the emotion not the music) this side of the gray waters of the Atlantic.

The live side of the Planning For Burial coin has a split personality where the audience is never sure what they are going to get; the loud version is a droning and noise-y wall of sound while the quiet version is soft and pretty. Both aspects though are exercises in wondrous depression. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Planning+for+Burial">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
