Keys N Krates (composed of band members Jr Flo, Matisse Francois, and Adam Tune) are an innovative group from Toronto, ON producing distinct and dynamic sets, mixing hip-hop samples with live instrumentals. Their musical style simultaneously represents the raw soul of live instrumentation (drums, bass, keyboard), manipulation of turntablism and the progressive technology of Electronic Music. The result of this combination is surreal soundscapes and innovative melodies, hard hitting rhythms and an unmatched element of soul.

Keys N Krates have received rave reviews from online publications such as the Virgin blog, Urb Magazine, Killahbeez, and Frank 151 to name a few and have toured globally, and opened for artists such as Kid Cudi.

The self proclaimed "Live Remix" artists are something to be both seen and heard. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Keys+N+Krates">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
