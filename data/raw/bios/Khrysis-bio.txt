Christopher Tyson (better known as Khrysis; pronounced "crisis") is an American producer and occasional rapper from Durham, North Carolina, best known as one of the former in-house producers of the North Carolina rap collective Justus League, as well as a current in-house producer for the Jamla record label. 

Khrysis began producing in his teens, recording tracks from his father's massive jazz and R&B record collection onto tape, and then extracting drum samples to make loops using a dual cassette player. He met rapper Chaundon at NC Central University, who introduced him to 9th Wonder. Later, he began an association with the Justus League and then formed The Away Team with fellow Justus League member Sean Boog, releasing their debut album National Anthem in May 2005.

During the Justus League years, Khrysis' production style was often comparable to fellow producer 9th Wonder, making beats for most of the Justus League collective, as well as Evidence, Skyzoo and members of the Boot Camp Clik such as Sean Price and Smif-n-Wessun. As the collective slowly started to splinter, Khrysis became an in-house producer for 9th Wonder's Jamla imprint, crafting beats for Rapsody, GQ, Heather Victoria and Reuben Vincent; as well as external artists such as Slum Village, Mac Miller, Busta Rhymes, Black Thought and Conway the Machine.

After various instrumental albums and EPs, Khrysis released his debut (compilation) album The Hour of Khrysis on April 20, 2021, featuring guest appearances from various artists including De La Soul, Evidence, Busta Rhymes, Pharoahe Monch, Rapsody, Sa-Roc and Geechi Suede. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Khrysis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
