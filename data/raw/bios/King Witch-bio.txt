Formed in early 2015 in a cavern beneath the streets of old Edinburgh, a lead-heavy brew of old school Metal and the meatiest of 70’s classic rock emerges in the form of King Witch.

Drawing comparisons ranging from Black Sabbath and Candlemass to Mastodon and High On Fire, the band’s first song Lucid attracted instant attention and the band’s reputation has quickly grown.

The powerhouse vocals of Laura Donnelly (ex-Firebrand Super Rock) give King Witch an unmistakable touch of class while Jamie Gilchrist (Guitars, ex-Firebrand Super Rock), Simon Anger (bass) and Tam Dickson (drums) provide a rock-solid and experienced backbone.

Doom-laden riffs, prog flourishes and Joplin-esque vocals combine to create a monolithic new force in heavy music - King Witch. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/King+Witch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
