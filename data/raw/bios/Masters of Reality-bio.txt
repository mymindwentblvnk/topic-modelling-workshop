Masters of Reality is a rock band formed in 1981 by guitarist, producer and singer Chris Goss and Tim Harrington in Syracuse, New York. The band is now part of the "Palm Desert Scene", which includes Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age and many other stoner rock or (as they prefer to call it) desert rock bands.

The band is named after the album "Master of Reality" by Black Sabbath.

After its first incarnation - which consisted of Chris Goss, Tim Harrington, Vinnie Ludovico and Googe - broke apart in 1989, the band developed into a band with alternating lineups. Masters of Reality resurfaced making headlines when former Cream drumming-legend Ginger Baker joined the band on their second album Sunrise on the Sufferbus which was recorded in 1992. Although the band landed a Top 10 chart hit with the single "She Got Me (When She Got Her Dress On)" Baker left the band only one year later. Victor Indrizzo, at that time drummer for Circus of Power, was asked to join and fill the vacant spot and agreed.

Goss' connection to Queens of the Stone Age resulted from producing Kyuss albums and  in the collaborative CD Deep in the Hole in 2001, and two years later, in the release of the subsequent live album Flak 'n' Flight.

Since their formation, Masters of Reality has made very different kinds of music, ranging from Stoner metal over progressive art rock to Beatlesque pop music.

Besides his involvement with this "project", frontman Chris Goss is also a very important producer (Kyuss, Soulwax, Melissa Auf der Maur, The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster etc.) and has contributed to many other bands in the Palm Desert Scene and beyond. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Masters+of+Reality">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
