Coming from the northern part of Germany’s black forest region (Baden-Württemberg), DEATHTINY were founded in the end of 2001. In terms of the musical direction of the band, the traditional heavy metal sound was to be enhanced by influences from other musical genres without missing out on heaviness and catchy hooklines. The realization of these goals lead to very riff-oriented songs with strong melodies and a mostly classical instrumentation by the keyboards. The female vocals, ranging from dark and expressive to melodic and even classical mezzo-soprano in combination with the aggressive black and death metal vocals and polyphonic vocal arrangements make up the characteristic trademarks of DEATHTINY. realeditorbest profile tools
