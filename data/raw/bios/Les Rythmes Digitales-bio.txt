Les Rythmes Digitales is an alias of Stuart Price, also known as Jacques Lu Cont and Thin White Duke.

His 1999 'Darkdancer' album, which combined elements of house, electro, disco and synthpop, was re-released in 2005 following the popularity of the track Jacques Your Body (Make Me Sweat) in an advert for Citroën's C4 car.

Following his efforts as Les Rythmes Digitales, Price went on to form electro-pop band Zoot Woman, and has more recently co-written and produced Madonna's 2005 album Confessions On A Dance Floor and remixed a wide variety of artists ranging from Depeche Mode and Röyksopp to The Killers and Coldplay.

In the end of 2008 Price produced the new albums for Keane and The Killers.  His later production credits include Scissor Sisters, Night Work and Pet Shop Boys Electric and Super. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Les+Rythmes+Digitales">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
