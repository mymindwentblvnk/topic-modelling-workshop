UNINVITED is a metal band from Varaždin, Croatia. It was assembled in the summer of 2010 by Antoni Popčević and Dario Sambol. They took things seriously from the very beginning, therefore it didn't took long for them to find the rest of the crew. They found Marko Ruža, Tomislav "Kosta" Kostanjevac and Marino Brnardić to complete the line - up. From this point on, UNINVITED started to destroy. In September 2011. Tomislav Kostanjevac left the band because of his education, the new bassist now is Velimir Dimkovski who is also the producer of our new upcoming EP. Uninvited's first EP "When Thoughts Collide" has been released in December 23rd 2011. with a great success. Currently they are doing as many shows as possible to promote their first EP, so if you want them in your town all you have to do is contact them via email uninvitedcro@gmail.com. Big thanks to Robert "kmica" Humek(ex vocal) who is also the founder of the name.
