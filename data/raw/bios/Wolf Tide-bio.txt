Wolf Tide are a Sydney-based electronic duo featuring singer-songwriter Rob Taylor and producer/songwriter Nick Lynar. The project was born from the bedroom production of Lynar with the pair teaming up for the first time on ‘Twisted Angles’, a demo shared around on Australian radio station Triple J’s Unearthed. After rave reviews by local blogs and live performances alongside early supporter and fellow South Coast artist Yahtzel, Taylor and Lynar made their collaboration official under the name Wolf Tide.

The first single from Wolf Tide is 'Spoke The Words'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wolf+Tide">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
