Huerco S. is the primary recording/performing alias of Brian Leeds, an American producer and DJ based in Brooklyn and originally from Kansas City. Leeds, under this moniker, has released two full-length albums – Colonial Patterns in 2013 and For Those of You Who Have Never (and Also Those Who Have) in 2016 – and multiple 12-inches since 2011, all to much critical acclaim, while also issuing material via other aliases Royal Crown of Sweden, Independence Ave. Orchestra, and Pendant.

His abstract and inventive take on house, techno, and ambient music, often given embellished descriptors like "outsider house" or "new dark swing," has found home on a variety of labels, including Software, Opal Tapes, Future Times, and most often Proibito. In 2017 he founded his own label West Mineral Ltd. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Huerco+S.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
