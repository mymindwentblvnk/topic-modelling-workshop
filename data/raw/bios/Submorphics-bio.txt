Submorphics is Detroit-based producer and lifetime musician Greg Axelrad. Originally a duo consisting of Greg (samples, synths, basslines, live keys and guitar, arrangement, sequencing) and longtime friend Ryan Lolas (drum programming, engineering, edits) late 2006 saw Greg taking full control over the project as a solo artist. Drawing on influences such as soul, rare groove, jazz, hip hop, deep house and film soundtracks, Submorphics' musical D&B output has received widespread global support from artists such as Makoto, High Contrast, LTJ Bukem, Marky, Danny Byrd, Big Bud, Alix Perez, Nookie and many more. With releases so far on labels like Spearhead Records, Vibez Recordings, Intrinsic Recordings, Blu Saphir Recordings and Cymbalism Recordings, Submorphics is establishing himself as one of the leading lights in the North American soulful drum n bass scene. Watch out for many more releases slated for 2007/2008, as well as collaborations with Mutt, Lenzman, Chino, Random Movement and many more! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Submorphics">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
