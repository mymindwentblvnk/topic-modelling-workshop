Decrepidemic was born in 2000, spawned by Eduardo Fernandes's (P.G.) desire to deliver some quality Brutal Death Metal. 
In 2002, Nelson Velho (Banjo), Paulo Rodrigues and Ricardo (Fred) joined the band, and so the line-up was complete. 
In 2003, the band played several shows across their own country and Spain. In the same year, Decrepidemic recorded their first Demo, entitled "Rehearsal CD" as a way to promote the band. 
Currently (as of 2006) the band is going through several preparations regarding the recording of their first album, beeing the line-up finally complete with: P.G. - Guitar/Vocals, Banjo - Guitar, Paulo - Bass, Fred - Vocals & Diogo - Drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Decrepidemic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
