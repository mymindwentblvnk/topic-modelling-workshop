When CARPATHIAN FOREST guitarists Tchort and BloodPervertor announced last year that they were leaving to set up a new band, THE 3rd ATTEMPT, they knew that they were leaving behind them the security of  one of the most iconic Norwegian Black Metal bands of all time, to literally start from the beginning with something completely new and unproven.  But when you have two musicians with the skill and experience of Tchort (GREEN CARNATION, ex-CARPATHIAN FOREST, ex EMPEROR, ex BLOOD RED THRONE) and BloodPervertor (APOSTASY, ex-CARPATHIAN FOREST, ex NEONGOD) who have the desire to work in an environment that could re-ignite the enthusiasm and creativity they felt they had lost, then you knew that a move was inevitable.  Just as you knew that the new band they would deliver up would be something very good indeed.

Finding a vocalist for THE 3rd ATTEMPT was the next task, and the two guitarists took the unusual step of holding on-line auditions, which netted them more applications than they had anticipated, both from  experienced and novice frontmen from all over the world, and resulted in the selection of Kaahrl Ødemark (ex- MIDNATTSVREDE, ex-NECROCAVE) to front the band.   Drummer Tybalt (FORTID, DEN SAAKALDTE, ETHEREAL FOREST, ex- HEATHEN DEITY, ex-PANTHEON I) was the next to join the ranks, when, following rehearsals  as session live drummer for their upcoming debut live appearance at Blastfest, it was decided that he should join THE 3rd ATTEMPT as a full-time member.

Interest from various labels was certainly not slow in materialising and after careful consideration THE 3rd ATTEMPT inked a deal with one of Norway’s foremost labels, DARK ESSENCE RECORDS. The  stage is now set for a new album and live appearances that will show the world that THE 3rd ATTEMPT has the talent, the experience, the drive and the enthusiasm to become a force to be reckoned with.
