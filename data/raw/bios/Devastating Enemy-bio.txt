Devastating Enemy was founded in January of 2007. Although each and every member came from projects with entirely different musical directions, it soon became clear, that the sound of Devastating Enemy should combine the most brutal aspects of extreme Death and Thrash Metal with the complex and yet catchy melodies of Modern Melodic Death Metal.
Mindblowing Blastbeats meet Epic Guitar Leads. High-Speed Thrash Metal Riffs meet the most brutal Breakdowns.
Devastating Enemy puts all these essences together, to create an unique, powerfull, melodic piece of Modern Death Metal.
In February 2009 Devastating Enemy recorded their second EP "The Gods of Reason" at the "Hinterhof Studios", Vienna. Working with experienced Metal-Producer Norbert Leitner, the CD perfectly represents the quality of Devastating Enemys songwriting. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Devastating+Enemy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
