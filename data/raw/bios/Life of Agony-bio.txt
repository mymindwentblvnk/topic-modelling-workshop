Life of Agony is an alternative metal band from Brooklyn, NY formed in 1989. The lineup initially comprised vocalist Mina Caputo and her cousin Joey Z on guitar, and long-time friend Alan Robert on bass. Type O Negative's drummer Sal Abruscato was hired to record albums 'River Runs Red' and 'Ugly' on drums. He re-joined the band when they reformed in 2003.

After releasing two albums with this line-up, Sal left due to musical differences, and recruited a drummer for the recording/touring of 'Soul Searching Sun.' Caputo felt that the band's original spirit had left the band, and decided to quit in 1997. After a tour with replacement vocalist Whitfield Crane, the singer from Ugly Kid Joe, the band officially disbanded in 1999.

In 2003, the band reunited with their original line-up and played two sold-out shows before their home-town crowd, receiving great reception. This eventually led to a new studio album in 2005, namely 'Broken Valley'. Caputo came out as transgender in 2011. The band broke up again in 2012.

In 2014 the original 'River Runs Red' line-up returned to stage for several gigs. Their latest album A Place Where There's No More Pain was released in 2017. An upcoming album 'The Sound of Scars' is set to be released in 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Life+of+Agony">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
