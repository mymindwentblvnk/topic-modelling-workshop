Beequeen is a duo from Nijmegen, Netherlands, formed by Frans de Waard (Freiband, Kapotte Muziek, Goem, ZÃ¨bra, Shifts, Post Destruction Music, etc.) and Freek Kinkelaar (Brunnen, The Beautiful Glassbottom Boat). They have been making music together since 1988.
Over the years they have released an impressive amount of tapes, vinyls and CDs. Defining their sound may be difficult, but recent albums like "Ownliness" and "The Bodyshop" have seen a fruitful merging of experiment music and ambient pop.
