Real Name: Graeme Shepherd.

Scottish Electro/ Disco House/ French Pop artist from Leeds, UK.

His debut album 'Heartbeats' was released on 17 May 2010 on Heartbeats Music. This was preceded by the lead single "Can't Shake This Feeling" on 7 May 2010.

He has also released EPs titled Runaway, Heartbeats and Sound Reaction.

He names his main influences as The Human League and Daft Punk.

Shepherd grew up in Linlithgow, near Edinburgh and then moved to Leeds in 2004 to study a Music Technology course in nearby Huddersfield.

Two years ago, when Grum started emailing tracks out to blogs, the response was instant: his tracks went viral (at one point last year he was the 2nd most-blogged artist on the net). This led to Kevin McKay (of Glasgow Underground/ Mylo’s Breastfed label) quickly tracking Grum down and setting up a boutique label for him, Heartbeats. 

Since then, radio DJs as diverse as Annie Nightingale and Jaymo & Andy George have played his tracks, and a host of acts like Lady GaGa, Friendly Fires and Passion Pit have called on his remixing services. 

Grum the DJ, meanwhile, has played everywhere from Bestival to Barcelona’s Razzmatazz. He has recently returned from a U.S tour alongside The Twelves.
