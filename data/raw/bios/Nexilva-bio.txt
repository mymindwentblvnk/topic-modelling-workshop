Nexilva are a six piece death metal machine from Sunderland in the North East of England. Blending technicality and sheer brutality these lads are definitely making a long lasting impression on anyone who gets in their way.

Having already played with some of the finest metal acts the U.K has to offer, a debut album under their belt, plenty of tours in the works and another release on the way for late this year, these guys are definitely the ones to watch in 2011! But for now the main focus of the band is their desire to bring their impressive, crushing live show further a field and play shows everywhere and anywhere they can.
