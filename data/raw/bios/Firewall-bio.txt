At least 2 artist are called Firewall.

1.
SINCERE:

Released 10/03 on A State of Trance, a division of Armada Music (Holland). Written and produced by Lange. Additional remix and production on track 2 by Andy Perring. 'Sincere' is a powerful driving, instrumental trancer from Lange, available here in the form of two similar mixes, both of which follow the same format and structure.

KILIMANJARO:

Released 4/04 on Lange Recordings. Written and produced by Lange. 'Kilimanjaro' is Lange's second release under his Firewall guise. The Original Mix follows the uplifting & melodic instrumental trance anthem formula set out by his previous release 'Sincere', hitting all the right buttons in the process, whilst his own Lange Mix is a deeper, percussion based version with a tougher vibe. Another superb release from Lange. 

2. A Finnish Stoner Metal band. Formed in 2001, they released a couple of Demos in 2003-04. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Firewall">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
