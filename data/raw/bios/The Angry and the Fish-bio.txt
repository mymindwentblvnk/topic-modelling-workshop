The Angry And The Fish was formed 2007 in Munich, Germany by members of the former local Metal Bands FUNEBRIS, SOMBER SERENITY and INTERNAL DECAY.
What startet as a Project of two Guitar-Players  Manuel Iosca (Git.), Christian Löbering (Git.), quickly grew up to a 4-Piece when Holger König (Drums) and René Ziegler (Shouter) also got infected with the virus of the Angry and the Fish.
The Sound of The Angry And The Fish is heavy, aggressive, melodic, modern and most importantly original. The lyrics are german.
