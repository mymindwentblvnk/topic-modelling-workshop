There are two artists with this name

1. Totality was a four piece funk-rock band from Atlanta, Georgia. The band originally formed as a progressive rock group but after the departure of their former keyboardist, the band temporarily went into a hiatus. However, in 2007 the band re-emerged with a vocalist replacing the former keyboardist. The newer incarnation of Totality was less derivative of 70's progressive rock and brought an all around newer, funkier and more energetic sound. The band consisted of Nic Vaughn (Bass), Nick Elward (Guitar/Backup Vocals), Kevin Thurston (Drums), and William Nacke (Vocals).

2. Totality is an unsigned Boston based Deathcore band currently with one EP release titled "Abaddon" .

Totality means: all that is, whether it has been discovered or not. It is usually conceived of as a unitary state of the external cosmos and internal spiritual consciousness — at least insofar as it can be acknowledged by the human mind — and is intelligible. In some varieties of philosophy, the Absolute describes ultimate reality.
