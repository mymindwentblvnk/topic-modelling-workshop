Anger Machine is a five piece Thrash Metal band from the Netherlands formed by graduated guitar player Thijmen den Hartigh in the summer of 2015. He asked the same musicians he asked for his examination of the Conservatory to join his band, and a talented guitar student of his to play the bass. 

Anger Machine makes modern, groovy thrash with melodic and harmonic guitar playing, influenced by bands like Pantera, Exodus and Lamb of God. Through clever composition they deliver varied yet consistent songs. Beside their songwriting the band’s distinctiveness lies in their Metalcore vocals and their highly technical solos which both leave their unique mark on the sound. On the 24th of September 2016 Anger Machine released its first EP “Unbreakable”, featuring five songs. At this point the band also started playing live shows in the Netherlands. Less than two months later on the 19th of November the band already won their first battle at the Bruut Battlefest.

While the EP got very positive response on the songwriting and skills of the band, the production got quite a lot of criticism. For the new single “Warpath” the band chose to work with producer David Hazeleger. The result is a far better sounding single which really manages to convey the energy and aggression of the band. The single, which came out on the 2nd of September 2017,  features the Warpath track and a cover of Sepultura’s Dead Embryonic Cells as a B-track.  With this single as their most positively received work thus far the band certainly is on a rising level.
