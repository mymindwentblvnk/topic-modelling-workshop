To exchange, to bring something together at one point, to collate - that’s what the Latin concept conferre stands for. The project KonFerenz by Klaus Jatho, Joachim Krohn und Marc Bornée is characterized very well by its name: the three musicians collate jazzy winds, spacious harmonies, an at times impulsive and at other times easy-going, groovy bass and the soulful voices of four different guest singers in their "KonFerenzRaum" while bringing this blend to a very non-chalant point. In fact, to a jazzy, loungy point.

This KonFerenz has been taking place for three years, to celebrate collective compositions. On their debut-album „Kontakt” KonFerenz now presents 15 titles jazzy music in contemporary form. Analogue instrumentation and electronic timbres produce a harmonious sound experience. Familiar and intimate, yet fresh and surprising.

Nestled into soft wind-textures is the sensuous voice of Chinaza from Berlin, who has also lent her vocal presence to Joy Denalane, the Katja Riemann Octet and Hattler among others.
Further attractive vocal-guests are the Göttinger sisters Amanda und Rebekka Bailey as well as Romana Reiff of Kassel. All of whom are experienced voices.

A relaxed composition for a lush summer night, a rainy autumn day, a snowy winter day and a gorgeous spring-awakening…
