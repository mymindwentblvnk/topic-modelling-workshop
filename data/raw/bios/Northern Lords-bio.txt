Norhern Lords is a french Viking/Death Metal band.

The origins of Northern Lords go back to october 2008, when some friends and musicians gathered in front of beers. Their differences gave them their slogan: Massive and melodic. Northern Lords was born and their first songs were written. And then, live shows began and the help of a temporary bass player was necessary but the line-up was still incomplete. 

Almost a year later, in july 2009, a new bass player finally joined the band permanently. In 2010 October, Roms leave the band and Corentin Briand, take place on drum.
