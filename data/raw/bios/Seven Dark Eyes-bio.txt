“Seven Dark Eyes” came to light in April 2002 when the founder members decided to give birth to a project that would allow them to unleash their passion for Gothic Metal and for bands like Lacuna Coil and The Gathering. Initially the group was little more than a side-project, but as time went by the group’s activity became more and more intense with live exhibitions in numerous venues in the local area. During the winter of 2003 the group composed and arranged the tracks that would eventually make up the mini CD “Lost Dreams”: a small concept album on the subject of dreams that was to receive excellent reviews. After a number of years playing live, the group locked itself into a recording studio and composed the debut album “…Across Oneiric Lands…” which was published in 2008 by the indie label Underground Symphony.
