Greeen Linez is a collaboration between Chris Greenberg (from the British electronic pop band Hong Kong In The 60s) and UK-born/Tokyo-based DJ/producer A Taut Line (aka Matt Lyne, co-founder of the Diskotopia label). The project combines the ‘90s dance music and R&B that soundtracked Chris and Matt’s childhoods with the ‘70s/’80s jazz-funk and synthesizer soundtracks that they have obsessed over in the years since. All of this is filtered through the cocktail of retro pop, fusion and supermarket muzak that Matt has been exposed to during his time in Japan. Following last year’s self-titled EP on Diskotopia, as well as remixes for Mau’lin (also on Diskotopia), Darkhouse Family (on Earnest Endeavours) and BD1982 (on B.YRSLF Division), their debut album Things That Fade is released summer 2012 on Diskotopia. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Greeen+Linez">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
