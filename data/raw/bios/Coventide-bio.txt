Coventide was formed in late March 2005 in the Northern Sands of Singapura.

Jaani & Aiiri is the pioneering member prior to that, before embracing Ryu & Flame to full battle. They are quite a young band, which strive to be different in their music composing, in terms of uniqueness & creativity.

Their main genre is Progressive/Folk Metal with Black/Death/Gothic flourishes.

Their quest to produce original or rather unique-sounding Epic Folk Metal music has been the main agenda eversince. Their goal is to create top-notch, Epic Folk Metal music with added Jazz influence & traditional Folk music from their own heritage.

Coventide released their 1st demo entitled Druids of the Eventyr in Sept 2006. The demo received positive feedback from MetalCrypt site, which have done a review on their demo.

Inspired by the positive outcome, Coventide pledged to produce more high quality products in 2007. They have planned to produce their 2nd demo by the year end. This time round with added vocals.
