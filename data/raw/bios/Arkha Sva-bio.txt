Arkha Sva was formed in 1996. Their contact address is in France, but the band members are from Japan. Aside from their country of origin, not much concrete information exists about the band members. Vordb of Belketre created the Arkha Sva logo used on the cover of Gloria Satanae in classic LLN style and provided the intro track to their Rekonquista demo. They employ a mix of high-pitched falsetto shrieking and aggressive growls, and they are known to use chanted interludes in their music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arkha+Sva">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
