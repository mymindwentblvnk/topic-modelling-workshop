Founded in spring 2004 Hamburg, Germany, the six members have played many venues around Germany and several Open Air Festivals together with bands as Corvus Corax and Haggard. They did their first Germany-Tour with the bands Ingrimm and Cumulo Nimbus succesfully in spring 2010. The ecstatically to powerfully, threshing sounds of the Drums played by Dominik combined with Chris' groovy, booming basslines and Dennis' lashing, fast riffs and solos, associated with sweet arcs of melodies played by violincellist Johanna and violinist Alex and the aggressive Rauschpfeife and happy Irish Bouzouki rounded off by the voice of frontman and charismatic singer Jannik, all go to make Vogelfrey. They perform with authentically ancient outfits and cheerfull show-interludes. The lyrics are of all shades, melancolic, funny, gloomy or meaningfull to give the music the right mix. Elements of different styles are integrated cleverly in the unmistakable sound of Vogelfrey. Pounding Metal, sweet-mystic Ballads, straight Rock, powerfull Folk-Punk & more. The Medival-Rockers also fascinated people who don't normally listen to music in this genre. The long awaited debut "Wiegenfestâ€œ will be released in winter 2010.
