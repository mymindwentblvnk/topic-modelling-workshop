If playing a harmonica over alternative hip hop isnt compelling enough, Stann Smith has proven himself as more than just an underdog of the growing alternative hip hop genre. He fuses lyrical dexterity over unorthodox polyphonic orchestration containing elements of jazz, folk, and blues melodies over lo-fi acid jazz drum loops for a unique hip hop sound. Taking his name from the adidas sneakers he frequently wore throughout his years of high school, Stann Smith is becoming a prominent force in the Brooklyn hip hop scene. Recieving airplay from Brooklyn College's WBCR 1090 AM to recieving praise from legends like Rock from Heltah Skeltah, he is definitely someone to look out for. Taking his skills to coffeehouses and bars, he grew a diverse appreciation for music and songwriting. Using an Akai MPC 4000, A Harmonica and Vocals as his primary instruments, Stann Smith is a lyricist and music producer that continue to expand the genre of hip hop as we know it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stann+Smith">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
