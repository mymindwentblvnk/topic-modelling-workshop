(1) Jazz swiss group  
The band consists of drums, bass, piano, and two singers (male and female), who occupy the centre stage: the magic melodies of Stefanie Suhner combine with the vocal variety of Andreas Lareida. Together with the rhythm section they perform wild improvisations as well as minimalistic grooves; from storm to silence. The five musicians make use of jazz tunes and pop forms to create a colourful contemporary mix. Thus their music forms something new, beyond all the existing genres – fashionable and original. Bartôk meets James Blake; Arvo Pärt fuses with Eivind Aarset.

(3) German jazz-rock band that released one album in 1971
