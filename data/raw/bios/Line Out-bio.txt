It's the year of 2010. in Serbia. Eleven years behind them. Lots of new people working with the bend, lots of new ways of expressing their music, lots of new work. Right now, Line Out has seven members. Vladimir Koprivica Kopra-drumms; Milan Djurdjevic Djukams-bass guitar; Zoltan Kis Zolja-electric guitar; Boris Golub Risbo-electric guitar; Dragoslav Mitrovic Citra-tenor sax; Tomislav Barak Toma-trumpet; Jovana Djurovic Joxa-vocal; The genre is, let's say a bit complicated, 'cause it's kind of a funky-punky-acid jazzy-tripHop-drumm&bass... Their first album "Masterpiece" has been published on April 2009.
