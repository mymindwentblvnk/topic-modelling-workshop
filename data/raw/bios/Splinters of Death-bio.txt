Splinters of Death was a sardonic and minimalistic Black Metal/Noise band that ran from 1999-2006, most noteably known for their extreme anti-islamic viewpoints.  While officially a completed project, they still play shows on occasion to support touring acts.  They have been viewed as a joke-band due to their irreverent satirical nature, but always held the ideology that "Black metal means FUCK YOU,"  despite what other people thought of them.  They were both hated and revered for the same reasons while they pushed the limits of a 'scene's' acceptable boundaries in a time when ideas such as 'kvlt' and 'no comprimises' were themselves comprimises.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Splinters+of+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
