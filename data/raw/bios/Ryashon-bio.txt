This project was formed on March 25, 2006. Ryashon is two brothers from Pittsburgh, PA who have been rocking out together since they first got our instruments in 2000 .. they are each in separate bands (Ryan - Ascend The Fallen, Sean - New Shores Burn) but wanted to do something a little different for fun so they started on this project. Ryashon has written quite a few songs over the span of there existence .. and they come up with tunes all the time, usually one or two songs a month.  Ryashon has a full length album out in addition to the rest of the work they have done.  It is called "The Stone Of Triumph" and is available on ryashon.com or myspace.com/ryashon . <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ryashon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
