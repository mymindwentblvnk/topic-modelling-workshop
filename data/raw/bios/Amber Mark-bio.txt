Singer-songwriter/Producer Amber Mark.

Amber Mark's multifaceted and sophisticated pop sound is rooted in a wide range of inspirations soaked up from time spent in the U.S., India, Germany, Brazil, and Nepal. She began writing music as a way to work through the 2013 death of her mother and in 2016, while in her early twenties, released her first songs: "Space," "Monsoon" (featuring her mother's voice), and "Way Back." The debut, supported by DJ Zane Lowe, left the biggest impact. The following year, after she signed with the Universal-distributed PMR Records -- home to similarly hard-to-pigeonhole singer/songwriters Jamie Woon and Jessie Ware -- Mark released 3:33am, an EP that featured the three previous singles and four new songs. Following the vibrant "Heat Wave" later that year, Mark issued another single, "Love Me Right," in early 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amber+Mark">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
