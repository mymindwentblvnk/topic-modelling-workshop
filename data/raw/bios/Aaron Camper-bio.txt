This singer/songwriter is a native of Salisbury, MD. Honing his talent in the church, Aaron has lent his vocal stylings and writing abilities to such Gospel heavyweights as Tye Tribbett & G.A., Marvin Sapp and The Clark Sisters, just to name a few. Aaron also joined the JILL SCOTT/Maxwell tour as one of JILL’s acclaimed All Male background vocal singers known affectionately as “THE PIPES”.

Aaron is now branching out on his own to impact the world with his music. His sound can be described as a new, young mix between John Legend and U2.
