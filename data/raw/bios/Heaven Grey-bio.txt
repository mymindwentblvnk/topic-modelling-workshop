Heaven Grey was formed in Rīga, Latvia in 1993 initially as a death metal band, and then, influenced by such bands as Paradise Lost, Tiamat, My Dying Bride and Sentenced moved on to doom metal/gothic metal with lyrics written in Latvian and English.

The band released two albums in the 1990s, Memory River (1996) and Northwind (1998), and became a well-known act in the metal community of Eastern Europe. They split up due to personal reasons (two band members died) at the beginning of the 2000s and the name Heaven Grey moved into the shadows for some years.

Heaven Grey reunited in 2007, returned to the active rehearsals and shows, and a completely new program has been created since then. Some of the new songs were released in June 2010 as a self-financed come-back demo album Falling Mist, warmly accepted by the audience throughout the world.
