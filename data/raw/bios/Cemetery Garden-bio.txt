Cemetery Garden is a Thrash Metal Band from Vienna, Austria founded in late 2009.

Knowing each other for many years, it was just a matter of time before Patrick, Stefan, Jacy and Cliff would form "Cemetery Garden". After being occupied with their former, heavier projects for several years, they decided it was time to team up for some serious Thrash Metal. 
Influenced by good ol' Thrash, Groove & Death, but also by new Progressive Metal bands, they set their goal to bring back the spirit of Rock'n'Roll to Heavy Metal.

Cemetery Garden have released their first full length Album "Personal Integrity" in October 2011 via TerraSound Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cemetery+Garden">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
