Although all six members of the Halifax Pier reside all across the United States, Claire Monty, Nathan Salsburg, Charles Sommer, Greg Burns, Jaime Reeder, and Forest Kuhn have managed to maintain their band since they first got together in 1998. With a sound that resembles a hybrid of gloomy folk and quiet chamber music through the minimal instrumentation of acoustic guitars, strings, and percussion, Temporary Residence Limited eventually released the Halifax Pier's self-titled debut full-length in 2000.
