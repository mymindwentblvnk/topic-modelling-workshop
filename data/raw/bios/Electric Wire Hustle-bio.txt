Developing their own sound and twist on modern hip-hop, psychedelic and soul, the music of EWH reaches forward while referencing key points of music's past. Thick drums and percussion layered with synth lines, hints of the Fender Rhodes and nylon stringed guitars have your neck snapping while your ears crane to its soulful vocals. 

While the EWH moniker is a relatively fresh name (formed in 2006) on the scene, this production trio is no stranger to the music game. Members Myele Manzanza, Taay Ninh, Mara TK are all familiar faces in the music scene in Wellington, New Zealand.

They have already worked with some of their contemporary influences such as Om'Mas Keith (Sa-Ra) , Waajeed (Platinum Pied Pipers/Bling47) , Steve Spacek (Sound in Colour), and Recloose.
 
Since forming in EWH have accrued a strong reputation for their live performance and have had the pleasure of sharing the stage with international artists Dam-Funk, Benji B and Steve Spacek, Alice Russell, Kid Koala, and DJ Krush. 

EWH’s first vinyl 12” EP featuring the tracks ‘Perception’ and collab with Steve Spacek ‘Longtime’ has been released through Wonderful Noise Records Japan distributed by Jazzy Sport.

In late 2009 they released their eponymous debut album on their own label, Every Waking Hour.  It contains collaborations with vocalists Stacey Epps, Georgia Anne Muldrow and Declaime, as well as Mara's father, legendary New Zealand guitarist Billy TK.  The album has been re-issued by UK label BBE in June 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Electric+Wire+Hustle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
