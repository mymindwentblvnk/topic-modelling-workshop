Percussionist Brijean Murphy, who has worked with artists such as Poolside, Toro Y Moi, U.S. Girls, collaborates with multi-instrumentalist and producer Doug Stuart to create WALKIE TALKIE.  The duo delivers a dreamy, back-room disco; creating an elegant, 8-song EP with a rhythmic and harmonic palette that evokes 70s disco, 90s house, and sly pop sensibilities. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brijean">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
