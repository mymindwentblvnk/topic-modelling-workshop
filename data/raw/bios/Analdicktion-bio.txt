Conceived in 2009 as a Brutal Slamming Death Metal outfit. After tons of line-up changes and demos, Analdicktion went towards a hybrid fusion of Brutal Death/Grindcore infused Goreviolence. Aziz from Scrotum Jus Records signed the band and Analdicktion started writing new material and began recording the full-length album SLUTS, which is now available on Scrotum Jus Records and Sevared Records. Analdicktion is currently readying for tours/shows around SE Asia and writing new material for a 7" EP
