1) * (Correction to the previous posting!) HELLEN was formed in 2004 by sisters Mindy and Desiree' DuPonte. Corrie "joined" HELLEN in late 2007 and was not a part of HELLEN'S formation .  Mindy DuPonte is the lead vocalist, drummer and main writer of  HELLEN's music. Mindy has a long history of song-writing.  In June of 2009 Corrie decided to leave HELLEN.***  Update:  As of August 2009 Mindy has a new guitarist "Ryan Abel" and bassist "Andrew Heath"!  Both new members are familiar with HELLEN's legacy and have been major contributors to HELLEN's new material in the latter part of 2009. Mindy has never been happier and HELLEN is heavier than ever! HELLEN recently opened for KITTIE in Tempe AZ.

2)  Hellen is also a Japanese heavy metal band from the 1980's. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hellen">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
