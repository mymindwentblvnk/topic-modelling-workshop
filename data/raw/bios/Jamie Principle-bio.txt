Real Name:Byron Walton

Jamie Principle, house music producer and vocalist born in Chicago, Illinois. He began having entries on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in the early nineties, including "Cold World," a #22 dance hit that is a collaboration with Steve "Silk" Hurley.

His 1985 track "Your Love" (with Frankie Knuckles) is arguably the earliest house track, although as early house is indistinct from disco there were other songs from the era that contributed to the new genre in mid 1980's Chicago. The stripped down disco track was a sensation in the city's underground despite never being released on vinyl. The success of the song relied entirely upon tapes being copied and circulated through the clubs.

In 2004 he hit #1 on the US dance chart with Bac N Da Day which is a collaboration with another house music legend, Frankie Knuckles.

Famed for his breathy, Smokey Robinson-styled delivery, USA-born Principle's classic early house recordings were "Your Love", "Waiting On My Angel" and "Baby Wants To Ride". The latter gave this Chicago house master and innovator a hit after a long time in the shadows (although a more or less identical version appeared at the same time from Frankie Knuckles). Following "Rebels" there was a long absence from the nation's dancefloors punctuated only by US tracks "Cold World" (during a brief liaison with Atlantic Records) and "Date With The Rain" on a Steve "Silk" Hurley compilation. He re-emerged with a US smash in 1991 with "You're All I've Waited 4", self-written and co-produced with Hurley again <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jamie+Principle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
