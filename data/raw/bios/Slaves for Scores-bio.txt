Slaves for Scores started as an idea in 2000...Frustrated with hearing the same crap and "cookie cutter" bands on the radio all the time, Jason Schulze decided to start a band that would bring metal back to life. Taking the best of the old and the new and molding them together into a new style of metal.

It took nearly 2 years to find the right combination of people to make this happen. Jason first recruited his brother Josh to play bass. After some trial and error with other musicians, Paul Guidry, followed shortly after by Nic Svensson, joined the band in the summer of 2002.

The main core of the band was now complete...the only piece missing was a powerful, aggressive, yet melodic voice to complete the puzzle. After many months of frustrating auditions, Antony Hämäläinen found us in the summer of 2003. Slaves for Scores hit the Phoenix, AZ scene sharing the stage with such bands as Prong, Vehemence, All That Remains, Symphony X, Exodus, Immolation, Crematorium, King's X, as well as playing dozens of local shows making them one of Arizona's house hold names in metal.

In 2005, Slaves for Scores ushered in a new era as long time bass player Josh Schulze parted ways with the band and Mike Loose stepped in to fill the huge void. Now recharged, and with a new full length CD to be released, Slaves for Scores is ready to hit the stage and do it all over again.

Slaves for Scores brings you a unique style of metal. Not wanting to be pinned to just one genre, Slaves for Scores combines elements of technical, melodic, and death metal, as well as many other influences.
