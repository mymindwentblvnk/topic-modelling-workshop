Black Rob (born Robert Ross) was a rapper formerly signed to Bad Boy Records. He began associating with the label as early as 1996, appearing on several Bad Boy albums, as well as other projects. These guest appearances earned him a media buzz and he kept attention with the smash hit single "Whoa!". Following this, the album Life Story was released in 2000 and rose above Platinum sales. His second album, The Black Rob Report, failed to perform as strongly as his debut and quickly disappeared from the Billboard 100 charts.

Ross has a history of arrests spanning from his childhood to even after his record label signing and album release. This culminated in him recently being sentenced to seven years in prison in 2006 for failing to show up to court for his sentencing (which was to be 2 â€“ 6 years initially) in a grand larceny charge from 2004, in which he was accused of robbing more than $6,000 worth of jewelry from a hotel room. He was released from prison in May 2010, cutting ties with Bad Boy and releasing his third album Game Tested, Streets Approved the following year on July 26, 2011 via Duck Down Music. His fourth album Genuine Article was released in 2015, with features from various artists such as Sean Price, Tek, Q Parker, Ron Browz and Murda Mook.

On April 17, 2021, Ross passed away at the age of 51, due to kidney failure. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Rob">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
