There are numerous bands that go by the name "Cernunnos":

1. Militant Dark Ambient/Folk project of Hellenic NS black metal bands Wolfnacht and Ravenbanner. They released one full length and an EP

2. The word Cernunnos! refers to "the Horned God", "the Horned One," or even "the Stag King." When this musical idea was conceived in 1996, this definition may have been enough. And why not? This name seems appropriate enough for folk metal music with a dark side, as the earliest recordings attest. As the years passed, and the music and ideas in Cernunnos! changed, this word came to mean other things. Suddenly, HONESTY, STRENGTH, PERSEVERENCE, and the enduring commitment to THE DARK SIDE and FORCES OF NATURE guided Cernunnos! for many years, labeling the music as many things such as melodic death metal, black metal, and finally symphonic metal. Genres aside, Cernunnos! rose and fell like the tides with many victories and tragedies. Then, in 2006, the name Cernunnos! shape-shifted into something that resembled, more accurately, a PHOENIX. This bird, famous for it's ability to burn to ashes and rise from those ashes stronger and more magnificent than before, is now a more accurate description of what Cernunnos! truly is.
