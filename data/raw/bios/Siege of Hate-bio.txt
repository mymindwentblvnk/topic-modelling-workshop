Subversive by Nature. This is the concept that better describes the grindcore / mincecore of SIEGE OF HATE. Formed in 1997, SOH had as its first studio effort the demo-tape Return to Ashes (1998), which has achieved a very good acceptance in the underground scene inside and outside Brazil, with excellent reviews in magazines and fanzines. In the end of 2003, S.O.H. releases its 1st CD, Subversive by Nature, by Encore Records (Brazil), which counts on 20 pieces of pure sound devastation, from the most extreme Mince-core mixed to violent Death Metal to Crust Punk, as well as to Hardcore, as it can be checked out in a crushing version for No Religion, a classic from the Hardcore pioneers, D.R.I.. "Subversive by Nature" was also released in 2004 in Europe, by Karmageddon Media/New Aeon Media, and in 2005 in the U.S., by Candle Light Records, spreading Siege of Hate's rage worldwide.  In the beginning of 2006, S.O.H. releases the Split-CD Out of Progress, shared with the Canadian psychos Time Kills Everything (side project from Fuck the Facts), by the Brazilian label 2+2=5 Records, once more achieving a good acceptance of underground media in general. In August' 2008, guitarist and 2nd vocalist Ricarte Neto leaves the band for personal reasons (moved to Canada). Since then, S.O.H. keeps on going as a trio, formed by: Bruno Gabai (vocals and guitar), George Frizzo (bass) and Saulo Oliveira (drums).  Now, finally the band has released the 2nd full length CD, entitled "Deathmocracy", with 16 unreleased songs and is going on tour for the first time in Europe, on October 2009.
