Busted are a pop rock / power pop band originating from London, England that consists of James Bourne, Matt Willis and Charlie Simpson. Though originally short-lived, the band's success has helped all three musicians develop successful solo careers. Busted's debut single, "What I Go To School For", was released on 16 September 2002, and it charted at #3 in the UK as well as in the top 40 in other nations such as Ireland and Germany. As momentum for the group built, their debut album, titled simply 'Busted', followed on 30 September 2002.

Inspired by a real-life crush, the song "What I Go To School For" resulted in a popular music video starring supermodel Lorna Roberts. The parent album, charting at #2 in the UK, received middling critical reviews but became such a commercial success that it was multi-platinum certified by the RIAA. Charting placements in nations such as Austria, Ireland, and Japan spread word of the band, with their sound being compared to American pop punk acts such as Green Day and Sum 41. 

November 2003 saw the release of Busted's second album, titled 'A Present For Everyone'. That album also charted at #2 in the UK. A live album, called 'A Ticket For Everyone', was released in November 2004, with the group facing inter-member tension. 

The band split in January 2005 after Charlie decided to focus on his rock band Fightstar. Matt went on to release a solo album and has since become a television presenter with his wife. James founded the short-lived band Son Of Dork before focusing on songwriting. 

The band reformed in 2013 without Charlie to make a supergroup with McFly to create McBusted  

Busted annouced on 10 November 2015 that they are to reform as a trio, including Charlie, ten years after the band originally called it quits. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Busted">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
