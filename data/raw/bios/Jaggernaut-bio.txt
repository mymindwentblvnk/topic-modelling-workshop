JAGGENAUT was formed by the ex. drummer of HammerFall, Patrik RÃ¤fling and his brother Alex. The focus was to find creative and hard working musicians with the main goal to achieve total control and perfecting the music.
After a couple of member changes the last piece was founded when Niclas Johnsson entered the JAGGERNAUT with his great mind and voice. With him the concept were formed and all the pieced started to fall in to place.
As the concept developed further keyboards were added to expand the sound experience. The music became much harder and darker, moving away from the traditional metal that JAGGERNAUT played in the beginning.
JAGGERNAUT today is far from the early band on many levels, although the essence of the first ambitions are still there.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jaggernaut">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
