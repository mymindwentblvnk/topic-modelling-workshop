SAVAOTH, originally formed in 2001, are an extremely promising four piece act based in Athens, Greece.

Their music uniquely incorporates classical baroque era symphonic elements with the cutting edge of Scandinavian blackmetal and an industrial pinch, resulting in a majestic yet magnificently schizoid crossbreed.

Their debut album titled "Whispers Often Bleat" hit the stores in mid 2009 via I For An I Records & Media.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Savaoth">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
