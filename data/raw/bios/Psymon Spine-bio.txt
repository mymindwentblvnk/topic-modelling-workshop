Fusing psychedelic pop and the deep grooves of dance music, Brooklyn experimental pop outfit Psymon Spine’s music is oozing with approachable melodic hugeness on first contact—but the places these guys take their songs is truly out there, exploring complicated feelings and catharsis through a singular approach to left-of-center electronic and dance sounds.

Psymon Spine's origins date back to core members Noah Prebish and Peter Spears meeting in college and finding common ground in their artistic aims: "We wanted to make something that was experimental, but also accessible and satisfying," Prebish states while discussing the thrust of the band's origins, citing influences like Talking Heads and Os Mutantes along with the rush of the NYC dance scene. Eventually, keyboardist/producer Brother Michael joined Psymon Spine, as the trio hashed out the demos for what would become their debut, 2017's You Are Coming to My Birthday. Prebish's work in buzz-making dream-pop band Barrie led him to meet singer and multi-instrumentalist Sabine Holler, who eventually joined Psymon Spine's ranks after they both parted ways with the rest of Barrie.

Embracing and exploring left-field electronic sounds ranging from disco's high-energy rhythmic breakdowns to the upward build of early techno and motorik's indelibly incessant pulse. Psymon Spine put their own loopy and addictive stamp on the sounds of the past throughout, with surprises at every turn and the type of lush synth work that could only come from such brilliant students of dance music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Psymon+Spine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
