It is uncertain wether Icke und Er are from Spandau, a western Bezirk of Berlin .  Although they do rap in Spandauer dialects and about normal everyday life in spandau that represents a large culture in western Berlin, according to the "Hamburger Morgenpost" they are supposed to come from Hamburg.
Since they want to remain incognito the only information we have is that Icke is the producer, MC, a bit older than Er and suffers from diabetes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Icke+&+Er">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
