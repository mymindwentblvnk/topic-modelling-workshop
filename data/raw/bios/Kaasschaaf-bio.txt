Kaasschaaf is a party grindcore band from Arnhem, The Netherlands.

Kaasschaaf is a dutch word what means cheese grater. 
The name was found by Sjors Rothuizen when he founds out that a similar instrument is used with female circumcision in India. 
In the summer of 2009 Sjors invited Rob van Manen to go jamming and he joined the band on bass guitar, Patrick van Diek joined on the guitar.
Finding the right drummer was a problem. 
So to fill the void, in the meantime, they used a drumcomputer until they find a real drummer. 
On April 17th, 2010 Kaasschaaf recorded their first demo in the Jacobiberg studio in Arnhem. 
The demo is called Fistfuck, Wrist Stuck and was released on april 28, 2010. 
Later in 2010 Maarten Vermeulen joined the band as a second vocalist.
At the beginning of June Kaasschaaf found finally a drummer, Bas Leenders from De Grote Boodschap, right before their show at Fistfest where the new drummer performed one song with the band.
Michael left the band and the band has done several brutal shows to show they are at full power.
At the beginning of 2012 Thomas Jansen, from Blazkowicz, joined the band as a second guitarist.
Now the band is working hard on new songs for a upcoming full length album.
In the meantime, they released a split called Narcissistic Femdom Fornication with their brothers from Sickening Entertainment(BE) and did a mini-tour. The new cd is planned at the fall of 2013.
Due to some problems, the release date of their EP was a few months later. In februari 2015 the EP called "Punanidectomy" was released and is free to listen to on Youtube & Bandcamp.
