Haunting Eden is a new band that balances darkness and beauty with devastating power. 
The songs combine heavy guitars, passionate and emotional vocals, a hard driving rhythm section, 
melodic accessibility, and lyrics based in real world subjects. When you hear Haunting Eden's 
debut single "Like Water" suddenly the meaning behind the name of the band will click. 
The new single delivers music that is both haunting & mystifying while at the same time, 
the singing of lead vocalist Jo Lee will lure you in with sense of innocence likened to Eden. 

   The band formed in the fall of 2009 and immediately found their sound with an inspiring mix of 
traditional metal influences and pop sensibility. The band features a veteran line up that consists 
of Vocalist Jo Lee, Keyboardist Russell Sweet, Bassist Eric Naylor, Drummer Thomas Decker, 
and Guitarist Dave G. 

   Although Haunting Eden acknowledges their musical influences along the way, it is easily understood, 
through the essence of the bands music, that they have a distinct style all their own. It is said that 
every band has a story to tell so it is not surprising through the bands name to start with; that the story 
is one of reality involving both failure and mistakes in life while clinging to a sliver of hope & faith. 

   Haunting Eden is dark and haunting but relives paradise lost yet not gone forever in each song the 
band records. The band is in the process of completing their debut CD "Deliverance" with an expected release 
in December 2010. The CD that the band is releasing independently will be sure to gain attention with 
follow-up songs to "Like Water" such as "Conquer the Beast", "Trust In Lies", "La Tempesta", and more.
