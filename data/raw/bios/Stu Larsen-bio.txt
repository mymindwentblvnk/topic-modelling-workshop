Stu Larsen is an Australian singer-songwriter

At one point Larsen has no fixed address, no job, few possessions and little money - just a lot of generous friends who seem to let him sleep on their floor or couch, or in their spare room as he ventures onward. He appeared to be on a journey of sorts, perhaps searching for something greater than can be found in oneâ€™s own backyard. He spent time exploring & wandering all over the world. Through Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, road tripping with friends, playing unexpected shows in unexpected places, staying in the homes of old and new friends all along the way.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stu+Larsen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
