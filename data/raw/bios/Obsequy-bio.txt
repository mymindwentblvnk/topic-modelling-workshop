Obsequy is a melodic progressive death metal band from San Diego, CA. Formed in 2007 by guitarist/vocalist Alex Fidel. Obsequy changed their name to Reason in 2011. After many lineup change, the current one consists of drummer Nick Fidel, and a chapman stick player, Gary Jibilian (Jibilian/Setar), that fills-in on bass for the band live. Their debut release, Thoughtcrime was released on Dec. 22, 2009, and a song to be on the soundtrack CD (and possibly in the movie itself) for the Toxic Avenger Part 5 (Troma), called "The Toxic Avenger", is a bonus track on extremely limited versions of Thoughtcrime. Obsequy is currently working on a full length album, which is to be titled Reason. It is a concept album based on the metaphysical and epistemological tenants of Ayn Rand's philosophy.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Obsequy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
