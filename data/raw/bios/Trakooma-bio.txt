The bands jorney stared at the end of 2008 after the perfect lineup was found. Full of enthusiasm and trust for their music the bands members began to hone their playing skills, and after a few months the bands live debut dawned. Upon reciving good reviews from the gig, the band started to work on their first demo. After only three days at the studio, the bastard child of Trakooma was born. This three song long internet only release carried the name "Ihtiriekko".

Soon after the band was overflowing on new songs and ideas, so after a few more live performances it was decided to head back at the studio. On august 2009 Trakooma released the untitled internet promo. The feedback recived convinced the band to keep pushing forward. After a few more gigs, on spring of 2010 the band was forced to relinquish their drummer to particapate in our nations military service, regardless the band continued to practice and produce more music. On October of 2010 Trakooma decided to make a few adjustments to their music. Firstly the singing language was switched from finnish to english, secondly the band started to refine their music to be more melodic, but still remaining as aggressive an techical as possible.

February of 2011 the band released their self produced full long album labeled "Demented Brutality". The album has pleased Trakooma as well as it's listeners. Trakooma's future looks bright, chemistry between the members has reach to the highest possible point. As we eat the hunger grows and even though there has been alot of obsticles in our path, nothing can hinder the drive this group is on. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trakooma">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
