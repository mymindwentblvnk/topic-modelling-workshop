Infinite Dawn was a short lived Dutch metal band. It started out with Ronald Landa (who later was in Delain) and Paul Verbeek. They intented to create metal in the vein of more famous Dutch metal bands such as After Forever and Within Temptation, but with a darker and more melancholic edge to it.

After the release of the demo 'The Cry From A Grave' in 2003, all bandmembers but Ronald and Paul left. However, new band members were found and in 2004 the EP 'The Enigma Of Reign' was released.

In 2006 the band disbanded completely. A planned full length with eleven tracks (including a Slayer cover) never saw the light of day. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Infinite+Dawn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
