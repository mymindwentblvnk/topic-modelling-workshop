From the first listen its clear that Tombstone Crow have all the hallmarks of classic metal. The elements of melodic yet shredding guitar solos, the pounding  jackhammer drum rhythms and the super aggressive female vocals mixed with a talent for writing hooky, epic metal songs with a twist will grab the attention of music fans everywhere!
Tombstone Crow began Jamming in mid 2013, putting out the first E.P entitled simply 'Tombstone Crow' later that year. 
After receiving good reviews from local and foreign music publications, the band played shows across the U.K building up a strong live reputation as a hard hitting groove metal band.
Recording started in early 2014 for the bands first full length release 'Shadows from the  grave'  due to be released August 2014, all the while playing shows for an ever growing following.
