I Miss My Death (IMMD) is a symphonic metal band from Kyiv, Ukraine. The band illustrates the beauty of the world through a mystical prism.

The bands' feature is the combination of classical and metal elements that are most clearly felt in the duet of IMMD vocalists - academic soprano and extreme male vocals. The band doesn't stop at developing the symphonic metal genre and constantly enriches it with other musical influences.
