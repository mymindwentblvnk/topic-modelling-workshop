A symphonic black metal band from the Czech Republic. Formed in the late 1990s, they have released one full-length album entitled "...Undead" so far. The band consists of two members who played all instruments and did all vocals. Their music has many interesting piano/church organ parts and orchestrations combined with typical black metal guitar riffs. The music has a very modern symphonic black metal sound even though the album was released in 2000. It is very likely that the band has split up after the release of Undead.
