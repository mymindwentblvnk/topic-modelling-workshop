The Fifth Dawn were formed in the Summer of 2006 in Regina Saskatchewan. The band was initiated by Dan Celis-Arnusch (rhythm guitar) and Justin "Pierre" Garchinski (death vocals). Soon after, the band added Greg Berner (lead guitar), Brent Rodgers (drums) and Ryan Haggerty (bass) to fill the rest of the line-up. 

The band began playing shows in Feburary of 2007 after many months of writing and tightening up their songs. They have played with such bands as Unexpect and Anonymus and are playing a show with Dying Fetus in June 2007. They are beginning recording in May of 2007.

The band is still searching for a clean vocalist and are open to anyone willing to try out if they live in the Regina area.
