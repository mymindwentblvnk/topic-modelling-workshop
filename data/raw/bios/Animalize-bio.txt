French rockers Animalize

The roots of France’s Animalize go back to 2014, when the moniker was first chosen, but their lineup didn’t solidify until 2018. From the beginning, the power-trio’s influences were set: heavy metal from the ‘70s and ‘80s.

Animalize released their debut EP, 'Tapes from the Crypt', in 2020.

Their debut album ‘'Meat We're Made Of’ is released on June 30th 2022. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Animalize">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
