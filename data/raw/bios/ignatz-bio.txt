George Herriman created Ignatz in 1910. It was a vicious mouse in the comic Krazy Kat. Ignatz' favourite occupation was throwing bricks at Krazy Kats head, who thought it was a love declaration from the mouse. The Brussels, Belgium based artist Bram Devens uses Ignatz as his alter-ego for his own pile of bricks. Mind frying songs wrapped with effects and driven by improvisation and spontaneousness. Ignatz released his first three full albums on KRAAK, followed by a best of compilation of his cassette releases (on labels such as Scumbag Relations, Taped Sounds, Imvated, Goaty Tapes etc). Other work was released on Staalplaat and Conspiracy.
