Debuted in 2012, releasing a trio of EPs on Glasgow’s Dixon Avenue Basement Jams label. Drawing from classic Chicago house, with a no frills approach to production that made him the perfect fit for the label (whose motto is “real rockin’ raw shit from the street for the clubs”), the EPs made him an instant one-to-watch in house and techno. Now signed to Houndstooth look out 2016 ;) (c) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Marquis+Hawkes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
