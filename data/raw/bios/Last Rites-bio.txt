Last Rites consists of the Wright brothers (Paul and Nod) and can best be described as dark, melancholic rock with electronic textures. They were the driving force behind Fields of the Nephilim (1984-1991) when the original line-up of FotN split. After FotN the Wright brothers and the other remaining members (minus Carl McCoy) together with vocalist Andy Delaney started up Rubicon and released several EP's and two albums before calling it quits. In the late 90'ies the Wright brothers started up Last Rites to continue to evolve musically and stylistically. After two albums and one EP they're currently working on a third album (2008).

Last Rites is also a UK '82 Punk band from around the Glasgow area of Scotland.

Little information on this band is available these days.
