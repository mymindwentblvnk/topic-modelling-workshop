2) Ulv is Hvitt Munk, creating dark droning soundscapes. Experimenting with sounds and atmospheres. Ulv was formed in the summer of 2009, as a continuation of Norss. The sound of the latter is certainly upheld in Ulv, but at the same time, a more minimal drone approach is sought. Most of the Ulv tracks are best enjoyed with headphones, as the sometimes sickeningly low tones cannot be played well by the average sound equipment.

The aim of Ulv is to create soundscapes that allow the listener to dwell seemingly aimlessly in an unidentified dark place, yet at the same time give rise to the opportunity of self-reflection. Most importantly though, Ulv just would like to entertain you with his musical translation of depression, melancholy and loneliness.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ulv">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
