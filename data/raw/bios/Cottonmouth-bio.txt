2.  COTTONMOUTH is a jolly nice chap from the English countryside and has been producing music since he was 14 years of age. Cottonmouth uses excellent composition and always in on his best behaviour, on the other hand, Cottonmouth is a raving hare-brained crazy cat whose dubstep tracks have bombastic bass-lines & awe-inspiring drum melodies adding this equation together - and the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde routine is complete. 

Since his early days his taste in music has expanded into Dubstep, Drum‘n’Bass, Electronica and Electro. 

Cottonmouth has also been involved with many music recording labels including:

•Permanent Damage Records
•Dubzilla Recordings
•Monkey Beats
•Dub War
•Orson Recordings
•Bom-Beatz
•Monkey Dub Recording
