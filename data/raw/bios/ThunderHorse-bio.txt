They are purely built on AWESOMENESS go watch them play because they rule. They are sick of young guys trying to play classics. They are here and they mean business.

3. A fictional Dethklok tribute band, originally formed by Dethklok rhythm guitarist Toki Wartooth in the role of lead guitarist Skwisgaar Skwigelf. The original lineup (save for Toki) was fired by Dethklok and replaced by the band themselves, with Skwisgaar filling in as Toki. The band eventually disbanded after Dethklok realised the struggles of being an underground band with little help. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thunderhorse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
