Wake of Redemption is a heavy metal band of Christian faith based in North Carolina, USA. Formed in 2009, the band originally consisted of guitarist Matt Hoover (who in the late '80's/early '90's, played with rock vocal coach Jaime Vendera), guitarist Nick Wiley, drummer and vocalist Stephen Wiley, and bassist Arthur Summerlin. 

The four began playing together in 2008 when they were hired to be the backing band in the rock group Counterfall. After that group's disbandment, they decided to start their own band with a desire to play heavier, original music and thus, Wake of Redemption was born. Once material was written the band took to the road, playing to strong crowds throughout their native North Carolina. 

In mid 2010, they caught famed producer Jamie King's ear and recorded their present, unreleased CD "Earthshaker." The band's music is an eclectic blend of modern and classic metal with lyrics that touch on all aspects of the human experience. Their music appeals to fans of Metallica, Iron Maiden, Mastodon, and Opeth but has a ubiquitous quality with which many people empathize, even those who normally don't listen to the genre. Wake of Redemption is currently pursuing label interest and planning another tour in support of their album Earthshaker. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wake+of+Redemption">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
