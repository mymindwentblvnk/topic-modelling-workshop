Born and raised in the pocket of New England, M. Geddes Gengras made his way out to Los Angeles in 2005 and ever since then has steadily added projects and releases to the trail of tape that he drags around. 

He first came to attention as one half of Antique Brothers, a duo formed with his real-life brother Cyrus (releases on House of Alchemy, Foxglove, Phantom Limb, Not Not Fun, Stunned, Really Coastal), as a member of L.A. allstar improv sextet Thousands, and solo as Fantastic Ego, dropping acidic folk and tape manipulation bombs on the Phantom Limb label run by Grant Capes, also his duet partner in Fantastic Sleep, their deep drone project.  

Lately, he has dropped the Ego moniker and started recording under his own name, dropping epic synth science, as well as becoming a full time member of Robedoor, Pocahaunted, and forming Vibes, Low Light Situations, and Dogwiper. 

He has collaborated live and in the studio with acts as diverse as The Congos, Sun Araw, MV & EE, and Super Minerals. In addition to all this, he runs Green Machine Studios, based out of his home in east L.A., and has recorded such bands such as Super Minerals and Lateral Hyetography.

With past M. Geddes Gengras solo releases on Digitalis and Stunned, plus more coming on Stunned, Tape Drift, Ruralfaune, and his first solo LP on Abbadon records, along with a stream of super-limited releases on his own Peccant imprint, Gengras is honing in on a strange, new form of synthesizer mastery. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/M.+Geddes+Gengras">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
