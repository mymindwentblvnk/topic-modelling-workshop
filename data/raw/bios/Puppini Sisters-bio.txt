The Puppini Sisters are a musical trio specializing in 1940's style vocal 'close harmony' music. Members consist of Italian Marcella Puppini and English Stephanie O'Brien and Kate Mullins.

The group was founded by Marcella after she was inspired by the animated film Belleville Rendez-vous. The Puppini Sisters' debut single, "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy", is a cover of the iconic hit single by The Andrews Sisters and, although the three are not actually related, they name themselves so in tribute to The Andrews Sisters. One of the more unusual songs in their repertoire is Kate Bush's "Wuthering Heights", sung in the style of the Andrews Sisters. Marcella Puppini first studied Fashion Design at St Martins School of Art, and later joined Stephanie O'Brien and Kate Mullins at Trinity College of Music in London.

The Puppini Sisters are currently supported by a three-piece band featuring Martin Kolarides on guitar, Henry Tyler on drums/percussion and upright bassist Nick Pini. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Puppini+Sisters">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
