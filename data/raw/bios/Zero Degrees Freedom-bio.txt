Zero Degrees Freedom is the sound of darkness put to music. Lyrical investigations of internal conflict and self-loathing set to a violent soundtrack of weeping melody, crushing rhythm and grand orchestral sound-scapes. 

Having outgrown its earlier incarnation as a solo project; under which 2 releases were sent screaming into the world, the band evolved into its current state in mid 2003 when grindcore fanatic Chris Pope, Black-metal fiends Will Plaster and Linton Tuleja, and the ever-ecclectic Andy Collins added their musical weight and venom to the madness set into motion by (former solo artist) Simon Frech.

ZDF swiftly became a mainstay of the Tasmanian Metal scene, gaining several support slots with interstate touring bands, as well as invitations to perform interstate, including 'Reign in metal' in Sydney in December 2004.

In 2007, guitarist Andrew Serisier joined in the fray, replacing Will, who left to pursue other interests late in 2006.
 
With the lineup once again stabilised, ZDF are working towards a full length release in 2008..and a barrage of Australian shows throughout the year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zero+Degrees+Freedom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
