Zhala creates futuristic cosmic pop from Stockholm, Sweden. She's signed to Robyn's Konichiwa Records. 

Zhala toured the world as a chorist for Lykke Li, yet now sheâ€™s trying to make a career of her own. Her debut single Slippin Around was unveiled on April 17, 2015, an energetic piece of tribal pop which fits in the row of other rising Swedish pop acts like Niki & the Dove and Elliphant.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zhala">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
