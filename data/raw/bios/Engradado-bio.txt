Engradado is a Brazilian rock n'roll group from the city of Belo Horizonte, in the state of Minas Gerais, made up by Arthur "Tux" Alkmin, Augusto "Magrelo" Oliveira, Gabriel "Papito" Oliveira and Tavos Mata Machado. Its name means "Beer Crate" in Portuguese.

The band had its start as a power trio in 2009, with only guitarist Magrelo, bassist Tux and drummer Tavos in its line up. 

The group's purpose, defined in a night-out in a bar, was to come up with a set list centered around the 1970's rock n'roll and hard rock, with tributes to classics such as Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, AC/DC, Motörhead, Steppenwolf, Rolling Stones and Black Sabbath.

In 2012, the trio was joined by lead singer Papito. In this line-up, the group has released its first EP, recorded independently, "Mais Um Engradado e a Saideira", featuring four original tracks and a tribute to the Rolling Stones' "Sympathy for the Devil".

In 2014 the band released a single, "Caos Honesto", which marked the band's departure from lyrics in English, and its definitive identity as a Portuguese-speaking rock'n'roll act. The single was accompanied by a music video featuring Brazilian web-comedian João Carvalho. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Engradado">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
