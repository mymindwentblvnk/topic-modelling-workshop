Burning Colossus was formed in 2008 by Johan (Drums), Henrik (Guitar), Jimmy (Vocals and Guitar). Before joining the band Johan had never touched a pair of drumsticks. After a year of rehearsal Burning Colossus decided to enter the studio to record their debut EP. They play music influenced by Rock/Stoner-rock with a progressive touch and a mix from the early heavymetal bands. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burning+Colossus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
