Biography
We are a trio hailing from the gray Northwest who have a passion for Death Metal and creating new elements for people to hear. 

Vance and Anna were leftovers from a previous disintegrated project, and after a year of jamming and creating songs came Six Days of Darkness. After several vocal failures and guitarists, Vance took on the duty of vocals and his cousin Brandon took over on guitar. Spencer was added 7/01/2012 as the permanent bassist.

We have played at many local bars/pubs and concert venues, and are currently in the studio recording a professional quality record, as well as upgrading our social networks and designing new merchandise. 

We are Six Days of Darkness, and we are here to metal your face off. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Six+Days+of+Darkness">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
