1. Glorification is a Norwegian poprockband. From it's start in 2004 as an acoustic and vocal guitar duo with Marius Akerbæk (guitar, harmonica, vocals) and Magnus Granholt (guitar, vocals), Glorification has grown into a full poprock band adding Espen Grandahl (Bass), Frans Sønsterud (Percussion) and Christer Minge (Electric guitar, synth) to the lineup.

Akerbæk and Granholt are the composers and authors of the band, writing songs based on everyday life, emotions and fantasies. The music is influenced by artists like The Beautiful South, Jason Mraz, Switchfoot and Simon and Garfunkel. Most of their music is recognizable by the use of double vocals and acoustic guitars, with the electric guitar as a rythmic fillout.

February 2009 Glorification released their first ever professional recording, the 6 track long EP "Finding Hope". The release concert was played in the two original members hometown Halden in Norway.

The bands range has grown with it's addition of members, and the genre of their music range from slow rock ballads like LIVE to semi-acoustic trancerock like We are Free. These songs are the outer ends of the genre spectrum, leaving the rest of the songs as poprock tunes like Saints and Betsy's Song.
