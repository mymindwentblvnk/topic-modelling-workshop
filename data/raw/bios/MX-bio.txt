MX is one of the bands for which Brazilian thrash metal fans always have fond remembrance of and which left a great legacy in their homeland Cenario, but seemingly never reached the recognition they deserved. 

Formed in Santo André, São Paulo, in 1985, MX was initially comprised of vocalist Beraldo, bassist Yuri Konopinsk, guitarists Alexandre "Morto" and Décio Frignani and drummer Alexandre Cunha. Beraldo died tragically during an assault, Yuri left the bass position for a new member Eduardo "Morto" who ended up assuming vocal duties along with Alexandre Cunha. This formed the lineup to record their first demo tape, 1985's "Fighting For The Bastards". 
This demo along with their appearance on 1987's Headthrashers Live" compilation album, the band had drawn the attention of many headbangers throughout Brazil. After this they recorded their full-length debut "Simoniacal".

Unfortunately this debut didn't receive a proper promotion, but it seemed it was just a matter of time before MX would reach international stardom.  In 1989 came Mental Slavery", boasting improved production and better refined songs. But the lack of good touring was a roadblock and after bandmembers Décio and Chico left the band split  in 1989. 
The band reformed in 1999 with new bandmembers "Morto" (bass/vocals), C.M. on (guitar) and Alexandre G. "Dumbo" (guitar) releasing the album "Again". 
 In 2000 "Last File".  As of 2006 nothing has been heard of the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MX">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
