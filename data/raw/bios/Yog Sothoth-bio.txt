1) Lovecraft-inspired primitive black metal.

2) Short lived Avant-Prog/Zeuhl band that released one album in 1984 before disbanding. They have a very jazzy sound similar to bands like Shub-Niggurath and Vortex, and equally as dark and brooding. A very challenging but rewarding release that should appeal to fans of Zeuhl and Avant-Prog music.

3) Berlin School project of Michael Wilkes from Germany since 1994. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yog+Sothoth">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
