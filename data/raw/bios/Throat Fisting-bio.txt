Throat Fisting is a Bulgarian metal that released its debut CD in July 2010. Conceptually based on the darkest but honest thoughts of its members and brave enough to name some of the most repulsive characteristics of humanity. The band is fronted by two vocalists and their screams are like the voices inside the head of a schizophrenic - in constant contrast and in the same time amplifying each other in the shared struggle to accomplish this violent soundscape placed somewhere between our putrid reality and the pure unknown. The sound of Throat Fisting is influenced by all that metal music has seen so far and strives to find its place among the ones that are appreciating both the past and the current reincarnations of aggressive music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Throat+Fisting">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
