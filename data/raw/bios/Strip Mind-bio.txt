The original working title of the Boston based group was Seka but after a nasty lawsuit by the infamous adult film star of the same name, they changed it to Strip Mind in late 1992. Through a variety of band member changes and a radical chance from rock to hard metal, Strip Mind, the band went their separate ways in 1994. During the existence of the group they put out several releases, none of which managed to catch on to the mainstream. This is a real shame, because the music on What's In Your Mouth simply rocks.
