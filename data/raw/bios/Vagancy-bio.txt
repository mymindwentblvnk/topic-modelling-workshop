Vagancy is an Anarchist Grind/Black Metal band from Argentina, formed in 2008.
Most of their releases are improv songs. Rambo, the vocalist of the group, stated: "We used to rehearse at the drummer's house, then we meditated about things we hated, and shortly afterwards, we played and yelled those bad things, which became our inspiration to develop such raw, violent and sloppy material"
The band is currently on hiatus since the departure of Ivan, former drummer of the proyect.
