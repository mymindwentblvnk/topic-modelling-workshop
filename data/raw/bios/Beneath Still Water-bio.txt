Beneath Still Water is a band formed in Schio (Vi) in November 2013 by musicians aged between seventeen and eighteen, already engaged in musical studies. The band, despite of its young age, soon begins to produce material, melting the different influences of its members, ranging from groove (Lamb of God) to mathcore (Protest The Hero/Destrage), to death (Death/Beyond Creation), with moreover features that range from post to prog according to the Tool style. This material has soon been shown in several live contexts bringing the band to the knowledge of a wider audience, which shows its enthusiasm towards this peculiar music style, helping the band establish in the local metal scene. The band joins the Bee Studios in Thiene in November 2014 to record its first album: by the end of January, 10 pieces lasting altogether 52 minutes are produced, and they will form their first album called Raudra. In this first work the band shows its style interpreting most emotional melodies as well as the most fierce dissonances.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beneath+Still+Water">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
