US Golf 95 is an electronic producer from Glasgow, UK whose atmospheric minimalist music is reminiscent of 90's video game soundtracks, which isn't surprising as their name and album art assume the form of a apocryphal golf game. 

The nostalgic electronic aesthetic makes US Golf 95 fit in well with the broad genre of vaporwave. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/US+Golf+95">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
