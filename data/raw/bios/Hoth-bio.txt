There are two bands with the name Hoth.

1) Hoth hails from the icy blackness of the void seeking to envelop this world in an unending permafrost by bringing forth musical compositions that are captivating, powerful, and haunting.

Hoth is a Seattle-based black metal or blackened death metal band. 

In 2014 the band released a full-length album entitled Oathbreaker, a lauded and acclaimed musical saga that thrust the listener into a melancholy journey of isolation and corruption. Hoth has previously released a full-length in 2012 entitled Infinite Darkness. Before that they released an untitled demo EP.

In June 2018 their latest opus Astral Necromancy was released. This new album was years in the making and demonstrates the efforts Hoth has taken to create a worthy successor to their past works. 

2) The first concept of HOTH from Portugal was to combine keyboards and Metal, something vulgar in this era, but not so common in 1988. However, it was not until 1991 that some demos were recorded but never released. Due to the lack of proper recording material and the work with DECAYED, the project rested in a lethargic sleep until 1995 when old songs and new songs were recorded and released as a demo ("Odes To My Black Goddess") by Non Nobis. 

A deal was signed for an album that was recorded the next year, but it was never released due to the label going out of business. It was not until 2000, that a new label showed interest and in 2001 the debut album "Rites Of The Black Goddess" got released by Bahamut. Iron Pegazus contacted the band to release an LP version of the album, but so far, nothing has been released... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hoth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
