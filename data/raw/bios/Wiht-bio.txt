There are two bands known as Wiht, both from the UK

1) Wiht are a stoner doom outfit from Leeds. Bleary eyed grooves and bludgeoning pessimistic peaks combined with the ever present quest for the holy riff culminates in a tasty yet filthy pie of its own pedigree.

The 2009 self-titled EP is instrumental stoner/doom journey to the lands of Sleep, Earth, Saint Vitus, Neurosis, Earthless, Ulver... with slow, minimalistic parts, eerie atmospheric passages and some great riffage.

2) Wiht is a black metal project started by Lord Revenant (Fel, Winter Moon, Moldern, etc). Wiht is part of the Order of the Silver Night, a circle of projects spanning black metal, neofolk, avant-garde, and other underground genres.
There's been one release from the afore-mentioned black metal Wiht:
