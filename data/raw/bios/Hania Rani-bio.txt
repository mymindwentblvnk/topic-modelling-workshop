Hania Rani is a Polish composer and musician who splits her life between Warsaw and Berlin. Her compositions for piano were born out of a fascination with the piano as an instrument, and her desire to interpret its sound and harmonic possibilities in their entirety and in her own way.

With her debut album for Gondwana Records, released in 2019, she aims to project a sense of unlimited space and time, and to echo the influence of Icelandic landscapes and the Polish Bieszczady mountains within her music. Like all great artists, Hania Rani is ever evolving musically, and ever restless in her musical creations, seeking where her next project might lead her and we are delighted to be part of her journey. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/hania+rani">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
