Hailing from Providence, Rhode Island, these ex-members of Arab On Radar, La Machine, and Bossman play music. The kind that inspired Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore to buy them drinks the last time they played Brooklyn. Made in Mexico came into existence when Rebecca Mitchell moved to Providence from Oklahoma and was asked by Dare Matheson and Jon Loper (members of Providence's psychedelic freak-out ensemble La Machine) to start a band. Jon recalls that "Rebecca called and asked if I was into the idea of dragging Jeff Schneider out. Schneider was a guitarist in Arab On Radar. I'd played with him before so it seemed like a good enough idea to try."

The beginning rehearsals went strangely at first. Everyone tried their best to ease the tension by playing music they mutually agreed was good: Captain Beefheart, Devo, Chrome, Amon Duul II, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Sleetmute/Nightmute - and that's when writing began. The band debuted in 2005 before a packed show at the Safari Lounge located in downtown Providence, with Schneider wielding his trademark Travis Bean aluminum-necked guitar. As far as the people in attendance were concerned, everything they loved about these artists was back better than ever. One sarcastic fan yelled out "Arab On Radar!" Schneider looked out into the crowd and said, "Made in Mexico!" The fan replied, "It's magic!" and it was, it really was.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Made+in+Mexico">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
