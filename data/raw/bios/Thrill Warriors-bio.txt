After the breaking up of her former band Mini (bass) started longing for the stage again and this time she would have liked it to be only chicks. She met Space cowboy (drums) on the bus home, a girl she knew from a previous band, and they decided to start something new. 
Some time passed and nothing really heppened untill Mini's mom, who is a teacher, told her one day she had a pupil who plays guitar. So Mini called Fisten (guitar) up while she was a little busy with her boyfriend and things got a bit awkward but Mini didn't suspect a thing. (a little blonde-ness I sense?) Space Cowboy, Fisten and Mini started to play and Fisten was a bit sceptical towards the other's taste in music, Mini - obsessed with 80's rock/rock n roll and Space Cowboy - the industrial gothrocker. Fisten herself listened mostly to dirty, beer drinking Rock 'n' Roll and melodeath. (mind you, she's no an flames chick!). Anyway, it turned out very well n they found theirselves in what they prefered to call bad-ass bitch n roll. Mini, a bit drunk at a party, found a second guitarist - her old sleaze/rock n roll buddy Jenna (guitar) and called the others who were relieved that the band was now full set. At first, Jenna sang, but now we've found our a new, more raw singer in Sigge strong. The rest is Rock 'n' Roll.. And don't forget, as Tairrie B once said: 
"YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE THE GIRLFRIEND, YOU CAN BE THE GIRL ON STAGE."
