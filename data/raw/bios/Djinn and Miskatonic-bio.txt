Amidst the ruined cottages and decadent towers of a slumbering city, a hardy band of minstrels ply their lugubrious trade, playing their songs for the delectation of arachnoid spinners, phlegmatic lizards and metalheads who have sworn a black oath to abide by the Sabbath. Influenced by ye aforementioned Sabbathoid coventicle as well as numerous illustrious heretic sects such as Electric Wizard, Reverend Bizarre, Acid Bath and other lost downtuned brethren, Djinn and Miskatonic delve into the chronicles of Cthulhu and Cimmeria, the visions of Hammer, the books of the Malazan and many more forbidden revelations in search of inspiration and solace in their mission to preach the end-time revelations of the riff in a world that was doomed from the start.
