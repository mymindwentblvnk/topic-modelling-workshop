Chambao is a flamenco-electronic band originally from Malaga, Andalucia, Spain, known for a 'flamenco chill' sound that fuses flamenco sounds and palos (forms) with electronic music. The name of the band is taken from an improvised form of beach tent that is constructed as a means of sheltering from the wind and sun.

The band started by a trio of musicians from Malaga: María del Mar Rodríguez Carnero (aka La Mari), Eduardo and Dani (who left the band in 2005). They have released two albums of their own. In 2003, they were winners of the Premio Ondas musical award for their debut album, Endorfinas en la mente (Endorphins in the Mind).
