Zonaria is a melodic death metal band from Umeå, Sweden, formerly known as Seal Precious.

The band formed in 2001 by Simon Berglund, Christoffer Vikström, and Mikael Hammarberg, the band originally went under the name Seal Precious. Initially the band's style was power metal, with clean vocals. Several line-up changes prevented the band from recording, but after 2003, with the addition of second guitarist, Emil Nyström, and the band's name changed to Zonaria, they spent two years playing gigs in and around Umeå before recording and releasing Evolution Overdose in 2005.

In the spring of 2006, Zonaria recorded the CD single "Rendered in Vain" (and later shot a video for it). After that, Zonaria toured outside of Sweden, opening for Finnish black metal band Impaled Nazarene on a European tour. In October, Zonaria announced they had signed a record deal with Swedmetal Records to release "Rendered in Vain"; later, the song was included in the video game The Darkness.

In November 2006, Pivotal Rockordings signed Zonaria, and soon after, the band entered Black Lounge Studios with Per Nilsson and Jonas Kjellgren of Scar Symmetry to begin recording their debut album, Infamy and the Breed, which was released September 2007. In late July, bassist Jerry Ekman announced his departure and was replaced by Markus Åkebo. The band shot a video for the lead single, "The Armageddon Anthem," then toured much of Europe in the beginning of 2008 opening up for Marduk.

On 8 June 2008, Zonaria announce that they had signed a deal with Century Media Records. They toured Europe in support of the new album with Satyricon and then joined Vader and Septic Flesh throughout November and December 2008 as part of Vader's 25th anniversary tour. Their new album, The Cancer Empire, was released on 17 October 2008, was produced by Fredrik Nordström at Studio Fredman.

In early 2011, bassist Markus Åkebo left the band, and was replaced by Max Malmer (initially on a session basis). Later, an announcement was made that guitarist Caleb Bingham (ex-Five Finger Death Punch) had been hired to allow Simon Berglund to concentrate on singing.

Their new album, "Arrival of the Red Sun", was released on 23 July 2012.
