Magica is a power metal band from Constan≈£a, Romania

Magica started in February 2002 as a project of Bogdan Costea, directly with the recordings for the 1st album The Scroll of Stone (having more of a demo purpose). After 2 months of intense work, the material was ready! 12 power melodic heavy metal songs, in the vein of Rhapsody, Nightwish and Helloween, which show the high potential of the band. After the songs were ready Bogdan recruited the members of the band.
