Formerly known as Necrotism.

Necrophelia is a Black Metal band from the Netherlands/Unites States of America. It was formed in 2010, by Silent Wolf & Dark Necrotic. They have dubbed their style as “Necrotic Black Metal”. They put their most twisted ideas into the sound, and get alot of inspiration from the most sick happenings on this dying earth.

Necrophelia supports the war against Christianity and all that is holy!

Line-up :

Silent Wolf (Glenn van Dormolen) : Satanic Poetry, Scriptor of the Rituals
Dark Necrotic (Ryan Lynch) : Battleaxe, Haunting Chants, Synths
Algernoon (Daniel Bultrini) - Orchestrations of the Underworld
