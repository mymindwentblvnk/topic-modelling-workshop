There is a band of common-minded gentlemen that go under the guise of Clarias. Since it's formation, this five piece pop/rock group has received acclaim from music enthusiasts, critics and industry professionals alike. An unrelenting commitment towards writing and performing innovative and unique music has brought this group from the smallest basement clubs to the likes of amphitheaters and stadiums. Clarias has shared the bill with musical superstars like Bon Jovi, Nickleback, Barenaked Ladies, Kanye West and Jimmy Buffet. Their music has hit big on Sirius/XM, AAA, college, and top Boston radio stations, including Mix 98.5, who named them "Boston's Best Band". They have been embraced by thousands of fans across the country with their wildly exciting live shows, and the largely successful 2005 release, "Lines".

And now, the brand new studio album, "The Days of the Getaway", has been seamlessly and masterfully produced, engineered and mixed by the award winning music producer, Matthew Ellard (Weezer, Wilco, Eliot Smith) and mastered by Fred Kevorkian (Willie Nelson, Phish, Dave Matthews Band). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Clarias">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
