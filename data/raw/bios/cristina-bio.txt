There is more than one artist with this name, including: 
1) Cristina (1959-2020) was an American singer and writer remembered for her new wave recordings in the late 1970s and early 1980s in New York City. 
2) Cristina is an artist from Romania playing R&B songs. 

1) Cristina was Cristina Monet Zilkha (n√©e Monet-Palaci, born in New York City on 2 January 1959; died 1 April 2020), an American singer and writer remembered for her new wave recordings made for ZE Records in the late 1970s and early 1980s in New York City.
She was born into opulence and wealth, attending Harvard and London's School of Drama, floating freely between flats in London, Paris and New York City. In 1978, while working at a theater critic for the Village Voice, she met her future husband and founder of Ze Records Michael Zelkha. Zelkha was itching to get into the NYC underground punk/disco scenes, so they recorded a single called "Disco Clone," an incisive, if irritating satire of disco culture for which they enlisted the production talents of John Cale and hilariously corny vocal narration by actor Kevin Kline. Thankfully, the music improved by leaps and bounds by the time Cristina was recording her debut full-length Doll in the Box, but "Disco Clone" pretty much established Cristina's modus operandi: sleek, downtown Studio 54 jams with Cristina's haughty, detached, Brechtian vocal style; demonstrating her cool disillusionment with nightclubs full of "bored-looking bankers dancing with beautiful models." 
She released two albums: Cristina in 1980 (now re-released as Doll in the box) and Sleep It Off in 1984.

2) Cristina is an artist from Romania playing R&B songs.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cristina">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
