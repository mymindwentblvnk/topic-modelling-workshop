Scene reports. Regional styles. It all seems charmingly antiquated these days, given how social networking cross-pollination has transcended space and time and yielded everything from sunny surf-pop bands in Glasgow to south Floridians pounding out dreary industrial punk. But with a hyperliterate, tightly-wound, and irreverent brand of post-collegiate rock, Bent Shapes may just be the most quintessentially Boston band of the last few years. Since forming the group under the name Girlfriends in 2009, principal songwriters Ben Potrykus and Andy Sadoway have largely ignored indie trends leaking from the "industry cities" in favor of churning out earnest, expertly-crafted pop and post-punk with thoughtful lyrics. 2013’s Feels Weird offered a glimpse at the discomfort and desperation of youth, with hook-laced self-reflections on personal growth and decay that garnered critical acclaim from outlets as diverse as Maximum Rocknroll and Pitchfork. A year-plus of shows with artists like John Vanderslice, Fucked Up, Ted Leo, and The Bats followed. With the addition of new members Luke Brandfon and Jenny Mudarri, the band is preparing to enter the studio in early 2015 to begin recording their second album, promising “a meditation on mental illness, the struggle to bring goodness into the world, and faith in humanity as a renewable resource.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bent+Shapes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
