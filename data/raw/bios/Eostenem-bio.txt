Year 2000 saw the birth of Eostenem. The desire of its creator was to make a so-called dark music without the usual clich√©s.

The first demo " *O* ", released in June 2001, offered 5 tracks between Death Metal and Black Metal, and then the underground scene was able to discover this one-man-work, to respect the basis of the style and to turn them into an original and personal way.

This alchemy was improved with the second release "Alphabetical Reasons to Die... ", in February 2002, in which a powerful raw Death Metal met atmospherical and electro waves without an easy electro metal approach. The success of this demo was incredible in the french underground fanzines, they saw in Eostenem a great french hopeful project.

End 2002, Blackend Records offered a contract to Eostenem so this is the opportunity for showing to a larger audience his whole potential. Eostenem entered the Atomic Art Studio at mid January 2003 and the most important change is the replacement of the drum machine by Dirk Verbeuren from Scarve. And 15 days later, Eostenem completed his first LP. 10 Tracks, for the album "I Scream You Suffer They Die", released on March 2004 on Blackend records.
