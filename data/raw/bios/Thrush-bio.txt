1) Thrush is a punk/hardcore band from Sydney, Australia


2) Thrush is a highly melodic rock band with a few punk tendencies but unlike most bands of the thinning genre. Thrush holds their own weight in this rock marketplace and leaves a small mark on the scene at large.

3) Thrush was a Ska Punk/pronk recording duo formed in South Petherton, Somerset during 2003. K-ball & Jim started working together in ska/punk band The FluF & soon started working on other projects in order to play other instruments & make different music. 
   Other projects they have both been involved in include Cockney Lobster, the Sea Street Urchins, Octo-pie, & in 2007 they started the G.O.M! band which in many ways follows on from Thrush. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thrush">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
