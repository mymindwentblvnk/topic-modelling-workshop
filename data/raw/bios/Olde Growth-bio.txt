Olde Growth is a two piece from Boston, MA with a heavy, down-tempo style that feels right at home in the “doom/sludge/stoner metal” paradigm, while refusing to be contained. Using a limited palate of bass and drums, Olde Growth creates music that evokes the awe inspiring relics of the natural world - giant trees that span millennia, jagged, snow-capped mountains that only the bravest of souls attempt to scale, oceans who’s mysterious depth are as alien as the most imaginative worlds out of science fiction.

Several years in the making, Olde Growth’s self-titled debut weighs in with thick, heavy slabs of sludge, raw brutal energy, monolithic riffs and vocals that run the gamut from piercing screams to soft, nuanced and melodic. Amplifier drone fills the gaps between cuts which, massive like the Redwood giants, block out the sun and engulf all that lies within the radius of their shadow.
