We do not know all there is to know about God, because as finite human beings we simply cannot know all there is. But we do know about His love and grace for us, and our hope is when you hear our music and listen to our lyrics you encounter King Jesus and His love and grace for you... We long for that.
Veracity started in 2009 by husband and wife Chuck and Charlotte Donahue to use the blessings and gifts given to them to help others know Christ and to keep believers strong in their faith. They feel very strongly about giving back to others the love God has shown to them with their music and Charlotte's testimony about battling depression, attempting suicide and how through prayer and God's grace & mercy, she was able to rise up out of the darkness. Their music, written and arranged by Charlotte and Chuck, is about the hope and strength God gives to those who open their hearts and minds to Him. The honest lyrics Charlotte writes are straight from her own struggles, finding peace through prayer and the Love of Christ.

Veracity also includes Gary Suess on Bass guitar
and Aharon Bouy on drums bringing their own life to the group and the music with their deep faith as well. Together they possess a strong bond that radiates the love of Christ. From playing local shows at churches to festivals, eventually opening for national Christian acts such as Citizen Way, Matthew West, and Britt Nicole, their energy and passion fuel the audience giving an unforgettable performance. The name Veracity means "absolute truth" and they bring the truth of God's love, power and strength every time they take the stage! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Veracity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
