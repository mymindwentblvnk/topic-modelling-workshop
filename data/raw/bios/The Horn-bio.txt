'The Horn' is a solo project by obscure Australian misanthrope, A Demon Sheen who is dedicated to setting every one of the spells of the ancient Egyptian spells of living and dying to music. The atmospheres he creates for these ancient spells range from bleakness drenched dark ambient rituals to Egyptian influenced black metal scorn to what he dubs "occult spacemetal".  As a true chaos-magician he refuses to be limited by superficial notions of genre and revels in the alchemy of creating music that exists between the currently established norms.   As such he has garnered reviews of such scorn and hatred that he has become, in some people's reckoning, "the most hated band in the world".  

A Demon Sheen is also the man behind the solo projects HAARK, GRIST, and FORGOTTEN CAIRNS, as well as being a central member of MERGE INTO STRIPES, GNAUMGN, DEAD ANTS RAINBOW/TRIO, and RAKSHASA.  According to rumours, he is also involved in several other secret projects as well.

An entirely unrelated artist  called 'The Horn' is a project by Steven Horne, who releases delightful house-y techno and techno-y house on Global Communication's Universal Language label of olde, and co-owning label Z-Bop with David "Clatterbox" Kempston, where he releases under the moniker Even Steven. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Horn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
