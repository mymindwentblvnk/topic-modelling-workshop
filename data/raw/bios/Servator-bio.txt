SERVATOR came to life in 1993, and was called Encephalitis during the first year. We changed our name to The Prophecy in 1994 and finally SERVATOR in fall 1994.
Our roots were in Death Metal and some Thrash and Power Metal Influences. 
1994 our guitarist Tobias left the band and Alex joined us to become the new drummer, while Peter changed from the drums to guitar / vocals. Further members: Chrille on guitar and Mirco on bass and vocals.
Within the last years we developed our own style - and don't ask me how to call it... You still find some parts of Death, modern Thrash and Metalcore. We try to combine heaviness and melodic parts - without loosing power and groove. You may listen to it and make your own opinion;)
We are planning a sampler-CD with some new tracks with our friends The Animatronic (Hamburg). Some gigs should be played in 2007 to promote that. Next gig: 23.03.07, JFBZ Helmstedt with Nine Lives Lost and The Animatronic.
Our album "Humanity Offline" does not represent our very style today - but it still shows our direction. visit www.mp3.de -> Servator. Our homepage is in construction and should be online in summer 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Servator">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
