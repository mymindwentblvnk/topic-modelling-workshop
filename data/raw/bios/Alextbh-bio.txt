22 year old queer Malaysian artist Alextbh produces and writes R&B infused pop music. Since his debut release “tbh”, Alextbh has amassed over 10 million total Spotify streams and featured on the cover of Malaysia’s New Music Friday playlist.

The Kuala Lumpur native is no stranger to stages across Southeast Asia, performing for Good Vibes Festival in Malaysia and Laneway Festival in Singapore, along with opening slots for Clean Bandit and Sevdaliza. Alextbh is set to roll out a series of singles, starting in fall of 2018 including a debut music video.

Alextbh first started exploring music at age 14, when his parents got him an iPad so he could tinker with GarageBand.  He developed his singing abilities during his brief time in a church choir as well as trying to replicate Mariah Carey's voice in the shower. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alextbh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
