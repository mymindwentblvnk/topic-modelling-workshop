The band "Lenora" was formed by three former members Nora Kalnina, Jānis Cāns and Rihards Špacs as a result of experimenting with different popular music genres. Armands Petrikas and Matīss Lācis joined the band in late 2009 and made a big influence of the whole sound and structure. The music became more powerful with it's lyrics and melody.
In late 2010 Armands Petrikas left the band and Jānis Vērzemnieks (also known as JVe Art) took his place and the band begun to work even more intensive on the whole idea of band's concept.
In early 2011 Jānis Vērzemnieks left the band while he was generally concentrating on his project "JVe art" and his place was taken by Oskars Liukis.
The new member fitted the band very well with he's musical experience and in person. "Lenora" is still working on new records and playing concerts in Autumn 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lenora">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
