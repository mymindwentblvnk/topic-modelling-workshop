The members of Bloodkitt (literally "blood concrete" in german) have been making music together and solo since childhood. This is their expression of the darkest, ugliest, most masochistic (and sadomasochistic) side of their psyches. Raised on dark, heavy obscure music, horror movies, and other mental scar tissue. Middle fingers raised high to the local scene which emphasizes only what is fashionable at the time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bloodkitt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
