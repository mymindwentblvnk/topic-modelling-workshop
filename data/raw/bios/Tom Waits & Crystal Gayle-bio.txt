Tom Waits & Crystal Gayle released an album, One from the Heart, in 1982. It's a soundtrack album of Tom Waits compositions for the Francis Ford Coppola movie of the same name, One from the Heart. It was recorded from October 1980 to September 1981. The soundtrack was nominated for an Academy Award for Original Music Score.

Crystal Gayle features prominently on the record, performing either solo vocal or singing in duet with Waits on many of the songs. For Coppola's film, Waits originally wanted to work with Bette Midler, who previously sang a duet with him on the Billie Holiday-esque track "I Never Talk to Strangers" from Foreign Affairs, but due to previous engagements, Midler was unavailable.

During the film/album project Waits met his wife Kathleen Brennan, an employee at the studio where it was recorded. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Waits+&+Crystal+Gayle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
