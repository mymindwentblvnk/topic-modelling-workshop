Rolling Corpse is a Death Metal/Grindcore/Hardcore band from Finland.

The band was founded by Jortsu and Tomppa in summer of 2007 inspired by Napalm Death´s "Punk is a rotting corpse" demo. Allu was shortly asked for bass and that´s how the band started. In fall of 2007 the band recorded their first demo.

The Corpses rolled to the studio in early 2008, to record a fierce 5-song EP called "Supreme Cocktorture". It was released through Virkkala Rekords.
