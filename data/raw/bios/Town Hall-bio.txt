Town Hall is an adventurous indie folk band based in New York City. They've spent the last year playing shows from Seattle to San Diego, to Boston and beyond, and working on their debut LP due out in March 2012. 
For a taste of what the full length will be, check out the EP they released in January,Â "Sticky Notes and Paper Scraps." It's up on their Bandcamp (townhall.bandcamp.com) and you can download it for free, with a "name your price" kind of deal for those who especially love what they hear. "Sticky Notes" is filled with lush arrangements and a refined distortion that you don't typically hear coming from your run-of-the-mill folk group. On lead vocals are Phoebe Ryan and Stefan Weiner (also the mandolin player) with Jesse Kranzler on guitar. Check their Bandcamp for a list of all the other players on the album, because theres basically a whole orchestra in there. For more information on the group, check out their website (townhallband.com) or their Facebook (facebook.com/townhallband).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Town+Hall">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
