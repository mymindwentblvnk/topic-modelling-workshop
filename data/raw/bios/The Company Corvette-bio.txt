The Company Corvette has been rocking out and about the Philadelphia area since late 2006, delivering heavy rock that is blues-based, with a healthy dose of psychedelia and a metallic punch. This three-piece brings high-energy, riff-driven grooves mixed with laid back vocals and blistering, wah-wah drenched guitar action. With their second album self-released in August 2011, the band is trying to figure out how to bring their rock to you!
