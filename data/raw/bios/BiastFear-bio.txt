BiastFear is a band from Cleveland, OH. The band released the album "All Angels Scream" in December of 2000 and is a blend of R&B, Metal, and Soul. The songs have a very heavy metal guitar influence and Crystal's voice on the tracks blend well with the sound with backup growls from drummer Skitch. She does not growl or scream as many metal artists do now, but has an amazing vocal range. The songs have ripping double bass drums by Skitch, low crunchy bass guitar by Rob, and some amazing solos by Ormi. The band performed with Gatlin more often than not and even covered "No Sleep til Brooklyn" by the Beastie Boys with Gatlin and called it "No Sleep Til Cleveland". Some of the songs featured sound bytes from the films  "The Crow" and "City Of Angels". Some of the songs lyrics reflect the band's decision to enlist Crystal to sing for the band and add the R&B/Soul sound to the band in classic hip-hop praise fashion and how it was a groundbreaking decision for them.

The band broke up in July of 2003 and no longer tours.
