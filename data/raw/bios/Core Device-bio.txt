Core Device have a nicely balanced sound that involve layers of dynamics. Toured with amazing bands like Symphony X ( Mike Romeo produced their first cd )
OverKill, Nevermore and more. Their website is put together well and offers everything one could want. (Core Device Promotions Team)

Having gone to the club that night to see a band I had heard about, I found Core Device. Even though they're not the band I was going to see they were the only band I saw that night, or atleast remember. Strange bunch of guys, interesting music and lyrics. They stood out because they didn't do the stock crap on stage, they were real. So afterwards I offered our services to them, they accepted. Be sure to check out their website at www.coredevice.com and watch the videos and stuff, they're pretty funny. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Core+Device">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
