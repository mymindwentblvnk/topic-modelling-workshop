Since 2007, Fragmenta began whipping local crowds into a moshing frenzy with their searing brand of progressive edged thrash metal.  Fragmenta spent the following years gigging intensely playing many notable shows, receiving airplay both locally and internationally and having their demos featured in several worldwide compilations.

In 2011 Fragmenta released their debut album titled SEDITION; their intense thrash sound evolved even further, injected with unconventional grooves and tinged with industrial elements.  With a visceral "show no mercy" delivery, the band was criticized by controversial TV program Today Tonight, noting their "dark themes" and branding them "a violent assault on the senses".

SEDITION is receiving positive reviews by well known metal sites and respectable airplay while being accompanied by interviews on the air and on the web.

Fragmenta is currently performing Australia-wide to promote their album and are writing material for what promises to be another powerful release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fragmenta">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
