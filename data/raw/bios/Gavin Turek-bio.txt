The L.A. native known for her incredible voice, is also an experienced dancer, actress, and spokes person for the world renown make up brand Rimmel London. The Czechoslovakian African beauty began singing at a young age; writing her first song at the age of six. It wasn’t till Gavin reached college that she began taking her music seriously. When I asked what initially sparked her interest, she replied dryly, “A boy. It started out innocently. Writing was simply my emotional outlet so I started making music on my laptop. That led to my sister posting some of it online, which then led to working with incredible producers and beginning an album.” Crafting a sound that is soulful, memorable, danceable, earnest and shamelessly pop; all blended together by the soft soulfulness of Gavin’s voice.
