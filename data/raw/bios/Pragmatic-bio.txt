Pragmatic of Indianapolis, IN is known for their LIVE shows. Made up of members of past successful regional acts. We took the best elements of those past projects and have emerged with a better, more determined machine. A prominently rhythm driven band with a wall of sound that delivers low end to your chest, melody to your heart, and harmony to your soul. From A Capella to in your face screams, Pragmatic delivers art as diverse as the lives that sculpt it.
