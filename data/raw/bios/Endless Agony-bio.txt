ENDLESS AGONY was created around 2000 by ex members of a few bands of Clermont-ferrand (MALVELIANCE, ANCESTRAL, ALTA√èR, LETHEAN SHORE...). Definately black metal, the band released in 2003 his first long lenght CD which was signed by DEAD SUN RECORD; and participated in the Big Jama Tremplin in 2005.

Several line-up changes later, the band now plays black/death metal music and released a new full lenght cd, "Killing Machine", in september 2008 under their own label, Endless Sound Record. Mak joined the band in october of the same year as second guitarist and in this final line-up, the band plays live shows and finished to record a new album that is about to be released... 2010 should see the "Source of Hatred" released and Endless Agony appearance @ Metal Camp 2010!

From his creation, the band shares the stage with bands like : FURIA, IPSUM, BROKEN EDGE, SEPTIC FLESH, NATRON, EXECUTION, BEHEMOTH, GOJIRA, LYZANXIA, AGORA, NOISE DATA, PROXESS, CEREMONY OF OPPOSITES, BLOSIUS, etc... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Endless+Agony">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
