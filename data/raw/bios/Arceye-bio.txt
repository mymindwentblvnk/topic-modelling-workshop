BIOGRAPHY

Arceye is a four-piece death/thrash metal band from Shrewsbury UK. Since they formed
in 2004 with a hand full of riffs and heavy music as their drive, they have been
relentlessly unleashing their brand of extreme metal to the masses.

In 2007 Arceye released their first E.P “As The Ground Consumes You” this was met
with great acclaim from the likes of Kerrang, Terrorizer & Metal Hammer, whilst
building a strong local following and playing cities all over the UK such as London,
Birmingham, Manchester & Liverpool.

After establishing themselves as one of the most exciting bands on the underground
circuit Arceye went back into the studio in 2008 to record their debut album “The Divide
Between Chaos & Order”. The album was recorded at Old Chapel Studios in Newtown
with studio guru Russ Russell (Napalm Death, Evile, Dimmu Borgir) handling
mastering duties. 

The Divide Between Chaos & Order was released in September 2009
and launched Arceye onto the UK metal scene; soon after the release they supported
Finnish Metallers Finntroll & Battlelore, death metal titans Decapitated, Kataklysm &
Man Must Die to fantastic audiences.

After a string of headline shows up and down the country Arceye won the Wrexham
heat of the Bloodstock Metal To The Masses and went on to close The New Blood
Stage at BLOODSTOCK OPEN AIR 2010 with over 500 people cramming into the tent
to see them. The set was professionally filmed by Bloodstock and you can view this it

2011 has already seen Arceye have their track ‘Time & Tide’ featured on the CD cover
mounts of Metal Hammer & Terrorizer, the track also had an official music video release which can be viewed at- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPUHAOLkTzQ

After releasing Time And Tide they went on to play Hammerfest III to a packed out house gaining stella reviews from fans and critics alike.

The rest of 2011 will see Arceye returning to the studio to record their highly anticipated
sophomore album, now with former The Hollow Earth Theory drummer Craig Mackay
on drums it's already shaping up to be faster, tighter and more aggressive.
