Jamie Isaac is a London based singer and producer born and raised in Croydon. Signed to House Anxiety / Marathon Artists, Jamie's debut EP, I Will Be Cold Soon, attracted attention for its near-choral incantations, minimalist jazz tones and post-rock layering. Often compared to James Blake, Jamie marries experimental and enveloping swaggering beats and couplets. His forthcoming EP, Blue Break, is already gaining praise for "favouring space and atmosphere over production histrionics" (Guardian Music Blog). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jamie+Isaac">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
