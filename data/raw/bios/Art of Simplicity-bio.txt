In an effort to play good and interesting music, balancing “simplicity” and “art”, Matthew Dakoutros and Nick Miras formed art of simplicity during 2003. Merging several styles and different kinds of music, in a metal canvas, aos have received much appreciation from around the world and have been established as a very promising act.

art of simplicity derive influences from a vast variety of innovative genres and music groups. Most influences are from progressive rock/metal, post rock/metal, ambient, gothic, contemporary music, and other genres. However this does not stop in music. Important influences are considered any and all forms of art, any artist that has helped aos voice their stands and beliefs. On the other hand, the band is always ready to dispute their beliefs and try something new. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Art+Of+Simplicity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
