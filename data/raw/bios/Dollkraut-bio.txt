If there’s one thing that Dollkraut can’t stand, it’s predictability. For the past decade, frontman Pascal Pinkert has passionately pursued musical unpredictability. From muscular dub-flecked synthesizer workouts, to electro-fired post-punk, body wave and freaky ethnic explorations, Pinkert’s music surprises and thrills at every turn. This unpredictability and fearlessly open-minded approach is naturally also one of the standout features of the Dollkraut Band and Pinkert’s solo DJ performances.

Performed by Pinkert alongside a bass-player and a drummer, using a range of non-conventional analogue instruments and unusual, vintage synthesizers, Dollkraut's band shows combine a wall of sound and visuals with the same experimental, lo-fi approach that marks out Pinkert’s recorded output. Think members of Portishead, and Front242 jamming with Neu! and Linear Movement, and you’re close to the Dollkraut live sound. 
As for Pinkert’s future plans, you’ll just have to wait and see. If his career so far has taught us anything, he’ll most likely continue confounding expectations.

Dollkraut also received a lot of attention for his stunning reworks of Brandt Brauer Frick and Paul Frick feat. Emika. He managed to create "fake originals": many people were convinced that his versions were the originals and the originals were the remixes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dollkraut">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
