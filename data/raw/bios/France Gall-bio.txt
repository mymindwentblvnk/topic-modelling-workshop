France Gall (born Isabelle Geneviève Marie Anne Gall on 9 October, 1947 in Paris, France - died 7 January 2018) was an influential singer who performed for many decades. She notably represented Luxembourg in the 1965 Eurovision Song Contest with "Poupée de Cire, Poupée de Son"; that winning song was just one of many that she performed which had been written by Serge Gainsbourg.  Her career spanned roughly forty years, primarily in France, but she was best known over the world for the songs which she performed during the 60s, many of them a part of the ye-ye style. She sang in both French and English.

Besides the highly successful "Poupée de Cire, Poupée de Son", she also notably sung "Les Sucettes" and "Baby Pop".  In France, she was perhaps more known for the chanson songs she sang in the late-70s through the mid-80s, many of them written by her husband, Michel Berger, who died in 1992. In 1987, she had some additional international success with her Ella Fitzgerald tribute "Ella, elle l'a". She still recorded music into the new millennium.

France Gall died on 7 january 2018 at age 70 in a hospital in Paris. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/France+Gall">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
