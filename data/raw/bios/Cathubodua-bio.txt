Cathubodua was founded in the spring days of 2013, when the mind of violinist Katrien started creating marvelous metal symphonies. With Arely on drums, Roel and Kenny on guitars, Peter on bass and Sara as vocalist, rehearsals started to run smoothly.

Attempts at some home-recordings resulted in lots of fun and the band started to play on live occasions at several venues in Belgium. In the start of 2016, Arely decided to pursue other musical adventures and Cathubodua welcomed William in their midst.

With both dark and frivolous symphonies, a booming set of vocal chords and a fierce violin Cathubodua owns the stage wherever we go. Playing with symbols and visions, our shows treat the crowd to an energetic performance.

With our first EP release ‘Opus I: Dawn’ we proudly present our own unique blend of Epic Symphonic Metal. Imagine a symbiosis between classical music, folky tunes and metal genres of all sorts. The reoccurring themes are based on fantasy tales and historical legends. Heroes, wizards, princes, romans, goblins and of course a storyteller: that is what you’ll find here!
