Behold... The Arctopus is an experimental metal band from Brooklyn, New York, United States.

Behold... The Arctopus play instrumental music inspired by both metal and 20th century classical music. This technical and progressive style is executed on a regular electric guitar and drum kit but involves a 12-string Warr guitar, an instrument that covers the range of a bass and guitar and is generally played by tapping.

Influences on their music range from heavy metal, fusion to classical music, amongst other genres. Influential heavy metal bands include Cynic, Ulver, Death, Neurosis, Darkthrone and Meshuggah, Voivod and Gorguts. The following composers have influenced the band: Béla Bartók, Luciano Berio, Arnold Schoenberg and Krzysztof Penderecki.

Marston has explained the Behold... The Arctopus' recording process in an interview: "The songs written by one member were all scored out on paper and learned by the band. The first couple songs only had a few notated parts, the majority being written on the instrument and never written down. The trend has definitely been going more towards writing everything out." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Behold+The+Arctopus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
