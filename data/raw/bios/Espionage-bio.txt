-------------------------

1) Espionage were an 80s band who released 2 albums: "Espionage" (1983) and "ESP" (1985). On their first album, which contained their best known single "The Sound of Breaking Hearts", they played "standard" mainstream pop songs, but combined with a heavy synthpop sound. On their second album this unconventional approach was gone, as the band used a more conventional instrumentation.
