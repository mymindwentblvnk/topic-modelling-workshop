Escher’s Knot is a technical metal outfit from Chennai formed in July 2009. The band consists of Abijith (Ston’d) on vocals, Anshuman (ex-IIIrd Sovereign) on guitars, Madhav (Theorized) on bass and Manu (Blood & Iron) on drums. With influences ranging from Tool to Textures to Decapitated, the band caters to a unique blend of technical riffing and drumming, heavy bass lines and growls and screeches. Being one of the few metal bands to have cropped up in Chennai, the band has carried the mantle quite well with frequent pub gigs and outstation shows more recently. Despite their recent beginnings, the band has had considerable success come their way including being the winners of Unwind Center’s Underground Battle Of The Bands - grabbing all individual prizes, and making it to the Mood Indigo South Finals. The band released an EP in 2011 called Tesselations. The band relocated to Bangalore and is now based in Bangalore. They have featured in a Rock Street Journal compilation CD alongside Jeff Loomis and Mattias Eklundh.
