1. Death Trap is a Blackened Heavy metal band from Athens, Greece.













2. Hardcore/Thrash band from Sydney, Australia.


3. Death Trap  was around from 1983-1986 in King City California, we started out as DISTORTED YOUTH for about a year before changing the name to Death Trap. King City is a small agriculture town in the south end of Monterey County or basically in the middle of fucking no where! Death Trap was the first hardcore/punk band in King City and probably the surrounding area. We were very sloppy 3 chord punk and we played it the way we thought it was meant to be played. At first we mainly just practiced and played a few local parties. The local following was pretty much the band and 6 or so close friends. King City had a high school rodeo team and plenty of shit kickers to go a long with it so they didn't take to kindly to our music or us. So we wrote a song just for them called "NO HICKS". Eventually I made contact with a promoter from San Jose and a few other contacts and we played shows in Fresno, San Jose and Santa Cruz a few times. We never put anything out or were never on any compilations or anything. We were in Maximum Rock n Roll issue ..32 and a small piece in a earlier issue. The nearest town with any punk rock was at least 1 hour away from us. Later on Death Trap turned into Second Chance for less then a year but in that time played the famous GILMAN STREET PROJECT in 1988 and a show with Agression and D.I.
