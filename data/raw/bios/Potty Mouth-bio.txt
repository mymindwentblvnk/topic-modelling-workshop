Hailing from the home of Thurston Moore and Dinosaur Jr., and drawing from the fertile music community that is Western Massachusetts, Potty Mouth are all-parts smart-pop craftswomen, specializing in taut, infectious, C-86 influenced indie pop meets ’77 punk perfection. The band released their debut 12″ vinyl EP, entitled Sun Damage in July 2012, which garnered the attention of Pitchfork, who called the six-song EP an “an impressive, no-filler debut,” as well as The Boston Globe, who named Potty Mouth one of the “top five indie-rock bands to watch in 2013,” with BrooklynVegan adding that they were, “one of the most promising new bands in their local scene.” Departing from the more angular shades of post-punk heard in their EP, Hell Bent is marked by its significantly heavier production and melancholic hooks. Nonetheless, the album stays true to the confident, youthful punk aesthetic the band has cultivated for themselves.

Potty Mouth have shared the stage with Andrew W.K., The Pains of Being Pure At Heart, Bleached, Waxahatchee, and more, and recently performed at the New Museum in NYC in conjunction with their exhibit “NYC 1993: Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Potty+Mouth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
