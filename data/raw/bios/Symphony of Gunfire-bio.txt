Symphony of Gunfire are a unique fixture on the Scottish music scene in Edinburgh, UK and have been active since 2010. Their trusted brand of melodic shred metal with classic hard rock, coupled with passionate and energetic live shows are what make them stand out from others in the scene. 

The current lineup consists of founding members; guitarist Mark R. Grant and drummer Steve Platt, with Andy Armour on bass and vocalist, Barry "Boss" Chiz. 

The band draws heavily on influences from modern US and Gothenburg style metal, classic rock and traditional heavy metal, which are seemlessly fused together to give that unequivocal Symphony of Gunfire sound. 

The band released their debut album, digitally, available from the Official BandCamp Site which was mixed and mastered at Joy Street Sound studio in Garden Grove, C.A. by Bullets And Octane's Brent Clawson (Story Of The Year, Bullets And Octane, Wednesday 13, The Knives). 

Symphony of Gunfire are looking to make a huge impact with the new record; with World-wide radio airplay, two #1 MySpace music videos, interest from record labels, distribution and a continually growing fan base - not to mention catching the eye of multi-platinum record producer Beau Hill; they truly are a force to be reckoned with!
