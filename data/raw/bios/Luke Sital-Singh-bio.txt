Luke Sital-Singh is a British singer-songwriter. 

Sital-Singh was brought up in the small south west London town of New Malden, birthplace of folk legend John Martyn. The youngest of 3 brothers, Luke’s parents encouraged their sons to pick up musical instruments. Piano, saxophone, guitar and the flute were all part of the Sital-Singh ensemble with Luke taking up the violin at age 11. After picking up his brothers guitar, he has never looked back. 

The ever compelling and emotionally captivating young songwriter has his roots in an eclectic mix of songsmiths both young and old, from Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Joni Mitchell to Damien Rice, Josh Ritter and Tallest Man On Earth. Though a new artist and relatively unexposed, he has already established himself within BBC’s Introducing arena, gaining him a slot at Glastonbury 2010. 

Luke released his debut album, The Fire Inside, in August 2014. http://lukesitalsingh.com/ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Luke+Sital-Singh">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
