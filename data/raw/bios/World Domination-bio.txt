Brand new blackened hardcore band World Domination are about to do just that [Indonesia]. The band has released 3 tasty fucking tracks that will have all you Nails-adoring peeps groveling to hear more. Check out the tracks and a music video below: https://worlddomination.bandcamp.com/releases

“The band consists of AditXEdge (ex-Thinking Straight, Final Breath) and Fandrie (Soulare, A Thousand Punches) on guitar, Dado Suicido on bass/backing vocal (Paper Gangster), Kevin on drums/vocal (Pale). After the band’s first practice in 2017, the band had put together a couple of songs. The band recorded these songs at Venom Studio with Hamzah Kusbiyanto (Straightout, Hurt’em) behind the desk. At first, Gaga (Modern Guns) was going to be on vocals, but due to his busy schedule with Modern Guns, Kevin decided to step-up and destroyed all the songs with his brutal voice. Mixing was handled by Hari Kurnia (Stride, Thinking Straight) and Brad Boatright at Audiosiege (From Ashes Rise, Nails, Black Breath). That’s how the 3 song EP entitled “Forever Slave” came together.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/world+domination">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
