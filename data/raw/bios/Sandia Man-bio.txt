Shambling across a dusty cavern floor; cowering under the smoke and ash of the ultimate eruption; witnessing the final clash between titanic forces, SANDIA MAN rises from the collective unconscious of ten-thousand generations of humanity.

SANDIA MAN was formed in July 2008 by Alan
Edmonds & Jon Knutson (ex-Devil Riding Shotgun).

Steve "Sven" Esterly joined the group in October 2008, and their first show was in December, 2008.

Influenced by a variety of classic and modern fuzz/stoner/desert/doom rockers (Black Sabbath,Celtic Frost, Obsessed, Melvins, Neurosis, Sons of Otis, Electric Wizard, etc.), they bring their own flavor and years of playing experience to create something that is somehow familiar, yet fresh and powerful.

The band is named after a famous local caveman, who lived in Sandia Cave up on the Crest above Albuquerque, and the song “Sandia Man” is about what his life might have been like. Nature is fascinating, and has its awesome power, so an apocalyptic theme runs through their material. 

“Skins of the Fathers” is based upon the story of the same name by Clive Barker, and Mr. Barker has given his kind permission to use the idea.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SANDIA+MAN">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
