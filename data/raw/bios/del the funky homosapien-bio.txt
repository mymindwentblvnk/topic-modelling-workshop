Del The Funky Homosapien is Teren Delvon Jones (born August 12, 1972 in Oakland, California)

Cousin of seminal west coast rapper Ice Cube, Del began his career writing lyrics for Ice Cube's band, Da Lench Mob. In 1991, with the help of Ice Cube, Del released his first solo album, "I Wish My Brother George Was Here", at the age of 18. The album was a commercial success largely due to the popularity of the hit single, "Mistadobalina." Ultimately Del, who was not pleased with the limited musical range of the album, severed his production-artist relationship with Ice Cube for his next album, "No Need for Alarm".

No Need for Alarm also saw the introduction of the Oakland clique Hieroglyphics, whose original members included Souls of Mischief (Opio, A-Plus, Phesto and Tajai) Casual, Pep Love, Del, and producer Domino. No Need for Alarm helped to expose both the regional Oakland sound of hip hop, as well as the freestyle based, "golden era-97" style of hip hop being expanded at the time <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Del+The+Funky+Homosapien">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
