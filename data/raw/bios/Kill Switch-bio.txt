When it comes to music, the minds behind Kill Switch take things a step further. Known for disregarding the trends, they have the goal in mind to play exactly what they want. Throughout the years, Kill Switch has planted itself in the local scene, helping define metal. 

Describing Kill Switch’s music is not as easy as it seems. Complex bass and aggressive drums lay the groundwork, leading the way for the brutal guitars. Finally, like the final nail into a foundation, the dynamic vocals pull everything together. 

What about the makers behind the madness? It all started in 1998, when founding members Jeremy Bode (drums) and Mark Bassett (lead guitar), realized that it was time to exit the “cover band” stage and created their own band with their individual essence. In the spring of 1999, they embraced Ben Jacobson (bass) into the family and in 2000, another member was added in the form of Mark Holman (rhythm guitar). Finally, in 2005, Danny Wiechert (vocals) joined the force. 

These five different personalities and preferences in music have mixed into the perfect blend of metal. Recently, Kill Switch released it’s first full-length cd which demonstrates just how much the band loves to play what it wants. One show is all it will take to turn a skeptic into a believer.

"Kill Switch continually raises the standard while staying true to their form of straight forward metal."

-Nick "Jeffro" Iverson - Host of The Downshift (KMSU Mankato, MN) / writer for Static Magazine
