Big Frank formed out of the ashes of the Stoner Rock band Mute Hound. Ben Michon (Guitar), Matt Dupre' (Guitar), Josh Klipstein (Drums), and Andrew "P" Fridge (Bass) began with the idea to play some aggressive yet melodic tunes. Songs were written with no expectations flowing from the inspiration and camaraderie found in jamming with each other. After a few songs were completed, a search for a singer began to complete the line up and further enhance the songs. A few people were auditioned, but in the end none of them were quite what the guys were looking for. At this point it was decided that instead of finding a singer, the vocal duties would be shared by all the members of the group. This decision greatly diversifies Big Frank's music by having up to three different voices involved in any one song. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Frank">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
