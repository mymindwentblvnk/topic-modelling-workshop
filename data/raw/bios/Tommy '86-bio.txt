A French Electronic music producer (old alias Tommy), very inspired by 80's music such as synth-wave, synth-pop, new-wave, italo-disco, and other related genres. He started to make music in mid-2011, but produced his first synthwave tracks only at the beginning of 2012. After listening to a track of College he had the idea to do this kind of music. His first synth-wave productions had enough feedback to encourage him to continue. Tommy has released a few singles, three EP, one LP and some remixes, for other synth-wave artists such as Awkoder, Protector 101, Future Feelings and Gossip Culture. He also released three other remixes for three more established electronic artists: Kavinsky, Lifelike and SÃ©bastien Tellier. "Getting high" is one of the four remixes chosen by Lifelike & Popular Computer themselves and has been released on their own Computer Science label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tommy+%2786">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
