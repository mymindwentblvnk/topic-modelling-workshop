Brain Xcavator is started as a Death Metal cover band in the winter of 2004 in Cyprus by three students of Eastern Mediterranean University. Participating in one fest along with brother project "Hellcraft", the band played songs from Sepultura, Cannibal Corpse and Napalm Death. After the dismissal of the vocalist from school, the baterist has started to work on new songs. After a year, the baterist also has left the school and the band shrinks into a one man project of the former baterist. He recorded/programmed all the instruments alone at home. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brain+Xcavator">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
