Grim Reaper was a British heavy metal band from the NWOBHM style and era. The band was formed in 1979 in Droitwich, England, by Nick Bowcott.

They were signed to Darryl Johnston's Ebony Records and their debut was "See You in Hell". The album, with cover design by Garry Sharpe-Young, was released in 1984 and was distributed worldwide through RCA Records. Grim Reaper soon became readily identifiable with Bowcott's skillful guitar work and singer Steve Grimmett's not-always-quite-on-key banshee screams. Their successful world tour included a support shot at Texxas Jam playing to over 20,000 people. Their follow-up, 1985's "Fear No Evil" showed improvement on the production front and also enjoyed moderate success in both the U.S. and Europe.

Legal battles with Ebony delayed the release of the band's third album "Rock You to Hell" by almost 2 years. The album was released directly through RCA in 1987, again with a Garry Sharpe-Young cover design. However, by this time Grim Reaper's melodic power metal sound had fallen out of favor as much of the metal market moved toward heavier fare like Thrash metal and Speed metal. Even the major label distribution and popular video for the title track could not save the band. With production on their fourth album (reportedly to be called "Nothing Whatsoever to do with Hell") about to start, another round of legal action from Ebony effectively dealt the death blow to Grim Reaper.

Grimmett went on to front Onslaught and Lionsheart, as well as perform on several tribute albums. Bowcott became a freelance music writer and later staff contributor for publications like Circus and Guitar World. Bowcott also worked with Marshall Amplifiers' U.S. division.

Their 1985 video for "Fear No Evil", in which the band fights an evil wolfman and frees his slaves, was re-used by Weezer in 2005 as the video for their single We Are All On Drugs. Many Gen Xers may remember them as one of Beavis and Butt-head's least favorite bands.

In 2006 Eddie Trunk announced on Metal Mania that the band has reformed.

Grim Reaper "original" line up (without Nick Bowcott) played Keep It True VI festival in Lauda-Königshoffen the 08th April 2006. Steve Grimmet reformed the band under the name Steve Grimmett’s Grim Reaper.
