Hailing from Manchester, England. Originally formed late 1999 as Sphere, the band faced many changes, until finally becoming Allerjen Mid-2002. John Dower (Vocals/Bass), Paul Wilkinson (Guitar/Vocals) and Paul Tarbuck (Percussion/Vocals) The current line up has only been together since August 2003. After searching for the perfect fit, Paul Tarbuck, an old school and death metal fan was invited into the band. The final piece was in place and effectively a new band, Allerjen lost the nu from their genre and replaced it with hardcore. After almost scrapping all the old nu-metal material with a few of the heavier exceptions, the majority of Allerjens material is new. With the plan to unleash the new chaotic, genre busting material on the masses. Allerjen have stayed secret for too long, while preparing for what can only be known as the resurrection. With only one intention, they are back for good this time. They have taken a lot of time and effort into finding a unique sound which can be heard in any of their material. The bands creative spark and relentless energy can be seen in any of their performances. You can feel the passion and enthusiasm that is produced on stage by the band. Allerjen are proof that an unwavering dedication to craft, and a pure artistic vision can result in a powerful musical statement. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Allerjen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
