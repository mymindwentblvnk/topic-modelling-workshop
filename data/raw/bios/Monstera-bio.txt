Monstera band history.


It is said that the band’s birthday is 21 March of 2002, when “Monstera” had its first performance on the scene, but the history had started earlier. In autumn Roman Denissenko (vocal, guitar) and Aleksej Beljajev (drums) made the basis of the band. They rehearsed together and in spring appeared a new member in the band – Manzikov Valery (guitar) and soon they recorded their own demo «Пир Во Время Чумы» (“feast during the plague”). However Aleksej went away to England for a half of the year.

Roman and Valery decided to wait for Aleksej and they both proceeded to create new songs. At the same time they searched for a bass-guitarist and soon they found Roman Chernjaev.
  

The band was already formed; it was time to wait for the drummer in order to be a full “Monstera”.  In November Aleksej came back from the England. After three months of many rehearsals the band successfully made their debut at 21 March of 2002. After that there were a couple of performances at the end of 2002.

There were also troubles in the collective and soon Valery Manjikov left the band. “Monstera” became a trio. In spring of 2003 “Monstera” took part in the contest for the young bands, created by “Hard Rock Club” in Tallinn city and became a winner. There were so many performances…
 

In spring of 2005 “Monstera” made they first album «День Безмолвия».(“The day of silence”). At this moment band is working over their second album.
