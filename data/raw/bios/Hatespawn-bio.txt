HATESPAWN was formed by A.O.D. and A. Deathmonger in 2004, after the IMPENDING DOOM split off. A. Deathmonger (vocals) and A.O.D. (all instruments) decided to record two new songs ( Murder in Mind, Death Cult) for a Split 7"EP with Signum Diabolis at the "Rape of Harmonies" Studios. Obscure Abhorrence Productions released the EP in June 2005. In Feb. 2007 Raelin joined the band for the drum position & put the Band to another level & rehearsal masses starts very magical. This Unholy Trinity recorded a Demon-stration Tape entitled "Ascent from the kingdom below" in Sept.´07 at "RMK" on 8 tracks. The Edition of strictly limited 100 copies comes out in october & goes fast! This recording shows HATESPAWN´s definition how real DEATH METAL has to be sound. Now HATESPAWN´s working hard on material for the first Fullenght album , which will be out on FOG OF THE APOCALYPSE Records in 08. Await nothing more than obscure & apocalyptic DEATH METAL, the old & true way...beware, the Demons will return to conquer. So join our Death Cult...we hail by the METAL of DEATH!!!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hatespawn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
