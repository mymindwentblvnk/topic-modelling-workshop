There are a number of  bands named 'Cartoon'.

One is an electronical dance music band from Estonia. Members are Joosep JÃ¤rvesaar, Hugo Martin Maasikas and Ago Teppand.

Another is a RIO/Avant band from US, which released two albums in 80's.

Another is a bi-lingual band from Wales, UK, who released music in the late 90's.

Another is the Cork, Ireland-based jazz funk outfit whose 2006 CD Ban the Use of Jazz Music mixed cool grooving vocals with spoken-word interludes. Cartoon split soon after the release. They reformed for the 2007 Cork Jazz Festival but have not subsequently regrouped to perform or record.

Another band that goes by the name of Cartoon is an Australian Avant-garde funk quartet, modeled strongly of the famous bass-oriented group 'Primus'. They fell upon their complicated time signatures and bass riffs along with progressive, effected guitar parts and off-beat vocals which brought themselves forth as an original group, releasing "Ovine/Bovine" in 1995. This group fell apart, primarily due to the guitarists bipolar disorder becoming increasingly difficult to manage. They reformed after 15 years and released "Weather Station Fascination" in 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cartoon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
