HARALD SPENGLER, better known as LEE TAROT, ex-Stormwitch guitarist, recorded an album which was released at 23rd August 1999 by B.O. Records. The album is called "Odyssey", and the name Spengler has chosen for his band is TAROT`S MYST.
"Odyssey" is a concept album based on an ancient Greek epic poem "The Odyssey" written by Homer. It is the story of the Greek hero Odysseus (or Ulysses, as he was known in Roman myths) and his long journey home to Ithaca following the fall of Troy.
Musically this album sounds very similar to Spengler`s previous band, Stormwitch. 
TAROT`S MYST is not really a band, but a project. The band has never played live (and probably never will), and according to some rumours, they might release another album in the future, but many chances exist that it will only be sold via internet.
TAROT`S MYST is formed by Thommy Bloch (ex-Zar) on lead and harmony vocals, Dieter Bernert (also on Brainstorm) on drums, Jens Hörmann on bass and Uwe Hörmann playing all guitars (except the solo on "The Creature Within") and keyboards. 
All music was composed by Uwe Hörmann & Harald Spengler (except "Kingdom of the shadows", whose music was composed by Willi Hüll, and arranged by Uwe Hörmann). All lyrics were writen by Harald Spengler, but he doesn´t play any guitars, except the mentioned solo on "The Creature Within".
