This guys came from Natal in the Northeast corner of Brazil, and found together in 1989. Already in the same year they played on a big festival with VODU and recorded 2 demos. The tape "Sorrow" from 1996 contains very progressive, but not very good Metal. They had many line-up changes, but managed to release a song on the 1990 "Whiplash attack vol I" compilation. Here the music is already much better! After another change, and as a 3 member band their album is finally released in 1991 on the "Rock Brigade" label. They played a interesting mix of Metal with slightly progressive touch. In the year 1996 they released the demo "Sorrow", which is completely different! At this time they played progressive Rock music! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Croskill">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
