Our idea of Concept Work originates from the need to transpose into music the entire corpus of tales of “the Silmarillion”: given the extent of the work, both in length and content, we thought about an ensemble of concept albums. Some of them deal with sagas or specific tales, others cut across different periods of the Three Tolkenian Ages and Ancient Times. Here you will be able to follow day by day the progression of the composition of the albums we are working at. As a conclusion to the project you’ll find the Ainulindale, the final album containing the Original Music.
