Silent Kingdom was formed in the beginning of 1999. The concept is based on the history of Bosnia and Bosnian traditional music "Sevdalinka", combined with something no one combined before - black metal. 

In 2002. after already having released two demo albums ("Fields Of Dream" and "Visions From Forgotten Land") and one EP ("Whispering Nights And Majestic Winds"), Silent Kingdom started working on their debut full length CD "Bloodless", which was released through Walk Records two years later. It turned out to be quite an experimental album, full of black/death metal riffs, blast beats and oriental melodies, which established Silent Kingdom as the most original band in Bosnia. 

After a great success with "Bloodless", the band continued with their work. As a result, their second album "Reflections of Fire (The Journey)" was published in 2006. (Walk Records), making the band's fan list longer around the world. 

Third album "Legends of an Old Grave", has been released in October 2008. (Zero Budget Productions/Walk Records) and it became an instant hit in Europe. Released as CD and 12” vinyl (printed in golden and black vinyl) it was an real treat for fans. 

In December 2011 Silent Kingdom released their fourth album named “Path to Oblivion”  trough Zero Budget Productions in Czech Republic and Raptures Asylum in Italy. This album features couple of guest musicians such as Morean of Dark Fortress singing the entire song "Drown Them Back To Sleep" with solo by Pavel  Jeřábek of Edain, Petr Blackie Hosek  of Root and Emir Saracevic of HellRide and Snake Eater.
