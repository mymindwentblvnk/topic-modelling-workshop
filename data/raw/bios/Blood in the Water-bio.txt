Blood in the Water, or BITW, was a grind/melodic death metal band hailing from Tampa Bay, Florida. Their guitar sound was akin to the seminal works of classic Scandinavian melodeath acts such as At the Gates, Dark Tranquillity and In Flames, and they also cited grindcore bands such as Carcass, Cattle Decapitation and The Red Chord as heavy vocal influences.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blood+In+The+Water">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
