The Cave are four international teens: Huxley Rittman from the United States, Harry Darling from the United Kingdom, Haadi Moochhala, a Singaporean-Pakistani and Japanese-Mexican Emerson Gonzalez-Park.  Their unique take on alternative rock music is gaining fans and recognition in Singapore and abroad.  

2013 was a big year for The Cave; they were selected to perform for the Lucas Films holiday party at Avalon, were showcased at the Music Matters Festival and featured on HKGFM. They are currently ranked #2 on Reverbnation, often taking #1.

From there, they were signed to ToCo International and have garnered a big following in Eastern Europe, having been featured on Russian Music Television (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsCyzNOi1CI ) and in NME. And they were featured in the documentary: Here We Are.

Their second EP – Personal (not released yet) was mixed and mastered by Matt Anthony who is Grammy winner Halestorm’s engineer.  He says, “There is a unique energy and momentum that comes out in the music reminiscent of many of the legendary bands that have succeeded before them. I was taken by each members proficiency and the unique swagger and character of the vocals. He reminds me of a more progressive Jim Morrison. It is what the greats have done and I think The Cave is following in step confidently.”

Previously, they were finalists in the Yamaha Music awards and won the Hewlett Packard Live-O band competition and have play in established band venues and festivals such as BeerFest Asia and Esplanade on the Waterfront.

Chloe Chen from Hong Kong FM says of the band, “The band cast a shadow over the mundane market alternative rock we are hearing on the radio nowadays. The band are skilled and accomplished with much variety; everything within this group needs to be taken into account, the textural qualities with the guitars, the dynamics with the drums, and the complexities with the bass - everything fits perfectly together.”
