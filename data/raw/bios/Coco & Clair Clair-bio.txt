Coco & Clair Clair are a pop duo from Atlanta, Georgia. Pioneers of “demon glam rock,” their unapologetic & unmistakably hip-hop-influenced sound breathes new life into the lo-fi bedroom pop genre. The two met on Twitter in 2012 and soon after started recording songs together alongside Atlanta's Awful Records crew.

April 2017 marked the release of their first project, Posh, a seven-track album which features ’Sims 2,’ a quarantine anthem released three years ahead of its time. “I’m in my bedroom, playing Sims 2, what about you?”

In 2018, Coco & Clair Clair began to build more buzz and play shows across state lines--blessing their fans with a few more iconic singles along the way: ‘Pretty’, ‘Naomi & Kate,’ & ‘Bugs’.

2019 saw the duo performing in Texas, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, & Atlanta. At the girls’ headlining LA debut, Bay Area legend Kreayshawn DJ’d their set--foreshadowing a future collaboration. Later that month, the girls joined Clairo to perform their new song ‘Racecar’ together for the first time in front of a sold-out crowd at Atlanta’s Variety Playhouse.

In April, 2020, Coco & Clair Clair followed up ‘Racecar’ with a new EP, Treat Like Gold, which features Kreayshawn and a remix of ‘Pretty’. On ‘TLG’, their title track with Kreayshawn, The Fader wrote, “It’s a stilted, strange song, but, like most of Coco & Clair Clair’s music, that’s what makes it fun.”
