Since 2002 the Peeesseye (Jaime Fennelly, Chris Forsyth & Fritz Welch) has been combining elements of warped rock architecture, freejazz horror, intergalactic glossolalia and stripped down abstract expressionism. Their concerts and recordings travel through fields of fine decay and up against walls of bonechilling catharsis.
