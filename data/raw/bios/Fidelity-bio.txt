Fidelity (ex-Blasphemy) are a unique Progressive Death / Groove metal band from Israel. The band was formed on late March 07, by Roi Avni, Daniel Zaks and Guy Wolfus. 
During the first year of their activity, Fidelity wrote their title song "Blasphemy" and the following "Hymn For The Fallen", although there were lots of line-up changings. Eventually, Chen Sasson was brought in on the drums, mostly helping the songs to shape into a more solid, clear, and tight structure, and Fidelity performed their first critical show, that led to replacing the former lead vocaler bringing Ophir Uzan in. 

With this addition to the band's sound, new stuff was written and Fidelity started to gain shape of their unique sound. 

Most recently, Fidelity completed the current line-up with Yoni Jacob also on the guitars, and are planning on some intensive shows. 
Also, the band is recording nowadays their debut EP - "Conscious Convict", which is produced and mixed by Kfir Gov and Daniel Strosberg of Seek Irony.
As the completion of the work on the EP is nearing, Fidelity are preparing for intensive touring routine. After sharing a stage with bands like Matricide, Breorn, Prey for Nothing, Betzefer, Whorecore and many more, Fidelity are already starting to pave their path through the Israeli metal scene, and they have no intensions of stopping.
