Comett is a French indie band based in Paris and founded in 2005 by Alex C.P. Comett records a first self-produced EP entitled “Meeting With The Stars”. This EP is in reality a stepping-stone that urges Alex to improve his writing and to define his own musical universe, nurtured by pop, indie, and electronic influences. It is therefore only after several trips abroad (1 year in London and 2 years in Dublin) that the composition of a first album occurs. Back in France (Paris), Alex is able to surround himself with talented and creative people, beginning with Julien G., a drummer and rhythmic programmer who can refine the musical tone of the songs as the tracks are exchanged back and forth from Paris to Tours. Mixing and matching audacity and skills with music, cinema, and graphics, the album will eventually tell a story and will be entitled “My reality is your fiction”. Very soon after, Yoann Auzanneau (a.k.a Ozano), a graphic artist, joins the project, creates the characters, and puts the story in a retro-futurist world. Comett records the full album at “home” in 3 years, the final mixing and mastering is realized by Antoine Chaperon (Grisbi). A first stop-motion video is produced by Les lapins de l’espace (Grandville, I am un chien, Hawa, Bob the monster…) under the direction of Romain Wagner. The video introduces the album “My Reality is Your Fiction” with the single “Once Upon a Time/City of Lights”. With no marketing, the video and the song are quickly taken up by social networks, blogs and other Web sites. Proof of its uniqueness and originality, the single is part of several festivals including the International Festival of the clip (Protoclip), and won an award at the festival clip of Barcelona. Comett will release his first album during 2013 , which will be followed by several gigs.
