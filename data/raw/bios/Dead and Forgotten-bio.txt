Dead And Forgotten are a somewhat mysterious band. Not an awful lot is known about them. I can't even clarify how many members the band has, that is how little is known about them. However, they seem to have a rather small, but grateful following. Dead And Forgotten is about depression, loneliness, coldness, nihilism, & death. The band hails from Italy  (Alessandria, Piedmont) they formed in 2001. Their current masterpieces include the following. Demo 2002, "The Tempest" Demo 2003, "Ars Moriendi" EP 2004, "Strix sive de ludificatione daemonum" Full-length, 2008.
