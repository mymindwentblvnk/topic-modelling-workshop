Ascend is a collaborative musical project from California, United States between Gentry Densley (Iceburn, Eagle Twin) and Greg Anderson (Sunn O))), Goatsnake, Engine Kid, among others). Both have been making music that has crossed paths several times in the last 19 years. The most notable being during the 90s when Anderson’s band Engine Kid toured with and shared a split album with Densley’s band Iceburn. During that time both were heavily experimenting with the fusion of jazz (Mahavishnu Orchestra, Miles Davis, John Coltrane) and the dark behemoth tones of influences such as Melvins, Gore, Slint, Caspar Brotzmann.

Ascend re-visits some of the tones, and moods of their past works as well as traveling into uncharted territory all done with the utmost focus on heaviness and power.

The result of their first recordings materialized May 27th 2008 in the form of the album Ample Fire Within.
