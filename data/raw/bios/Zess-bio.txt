Zess was a short lived, “proto” dark doom band from Italy in the 80’s. The last known line-up, in 1988 before disbanding, was Mercy La Morgue (vocals & synth), Lord Ruthven (guitar), Dr. Polidori (guitar), Dr. Freudstein (bass) and F. Rosenkrantz (drums & synth).
After many years the vocalist of Zess (now in band Malombra) took the recordings from Zess' rehearsals and demos (from 1987 to 1988) to Black Widow Records and, after a light remastering, the album “Et In Arcadia Ego” was released in 2004. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zess">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
