1. Nyctophilia is one-man Black Metal from Poland, created in dark December of 2014.

2. One man noise project from Orange County, CA. Influences drawn from the likes of Brighter Death Now and the film Begotten. The music is an attempt to juxtapose the bleak and dark atmosphere of industry with the rawness and primitiveness of nature.
