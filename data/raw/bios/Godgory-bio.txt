Godgory were formed in 1992 by vocalist  Matte Andersson and drummer Erik Andersson (no relation, surprisingly) in Karlstad, Sweden. They have utilized a variety of session musicians over the years, including every member of the band World of Silence at one point or another. Godgory played a doom-inflected variant of Gothenburg melodeath characterized by slow percussive riffs, minimalistic but powerful drumming, deep subdued death growls, and highly melodic keyboards influenced by 70s rock.

Godgory ended in 2004, three years after the release of their last album. Since then, Matte and Erik have intermittently recorded with Loss and Grave Flowers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Godgory">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
