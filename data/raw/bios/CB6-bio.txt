Southend metal-infused hard-core band CB6 released their debut album ‘Succession’ on August 5,
Succession was recorded in five days in 2012 at Bucks University, with Matt Hyde (Slipknot, Machine Head, Gallows) taking the mixing and mastering duties after seeing a studio demo video. At the end of the third day of recording, however, disaster struck when the band began reviewing the files for that day and realised that all their work for the somewhat ironically titled track Elephant In The Room had just disappeared. They had to track it again, this time a little tighter and angrier, which resulted in a more aggression-fuelled take. Every cloud has a silver lining?
Now into their 12th year as an outfit, CB6 have been tirelessly working on new material soon to see light in 2014. A busy tour schedule is being worked on after the success of their first European tour which took them as far as Sweden and Denmark.
Succession is a celebration, a testament to CB6’s ' DIY/ 'never say die' approach to life on stage and off.
