The Deadists are a Swedish band with quite a unique sound (...here comes a whole bunch of comparisons and name dropping...) Entombed, Black Sabbath, The Melvins,  Neurosis, High on Fire... etc. Big driving guitar riffs that pitch and dive to make way for even chunkier riffs are complimented with gravel embedded vocals and a heavy groove. Mastered by Goran Finnberg (Dark Tranquillity, In Flames, Opeth, M.A.N.). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Deadists">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
