Manufacturer's Pride was a six piece melodic death metal band which hailed from Jyväskylä, Finland, active from 2006 through 2013 before splitting up. They produced two albums, "Faustian Evangalion" in 2007 and "The Sound of God's Absence" in 2009.

The music combines occasionally progressive death metal riffs and futuristic computed sounds harmonically weaved into a whole. The vocals bring forth aggression and clean notes to add more depth and to complement the rich melodic atmosphere. They had an ambitious musical mechanism aiming higher than the average consumer oriented product maker, with compromise not being something they settled on with their take on the melodic death metal subgenre.
