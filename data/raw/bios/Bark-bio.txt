------------
Bark is Norwegian born Terje Evensen, drummer and programmer, and New Zealand born (UK based) Angeline Conaghan vocals. 

The musical world of Bark is a world of electronic sounds, multiple layers of rhythms and atmospheres created from samples of machines, nature, people and transportation, among other sources. Grooving songs of simple bass lines, sweet and soaring melodies, .dark and sometimes politicised lyrics, and virtuoso programming. Pulsing urgent songs filled with subtle timings and phrases. 

As they are living in two separate countries, Barks music has been carefully crafted over an 18 month period working where the duo have worked intensively in studios both in Oslo and in London, all of the music was created and written by Terje and Angeline.
