Teddybears STHLM (Teddybears Stockholm) is a Swedish rock band that formed in 1991 as a hardcore band under the name Skull. The band initially consisted of singer Patrik Arve and the brothers Joakim Åhlund and Klas Åhlund, before drummer Olsson joined them. They released their debut album You Are Teddybears in 1993 and their second album, titled I Can't Believe It's Teddybears STHLM followed in 1996. Their third album Rock'n'Roll Highschool came out in 2000 and consisted of electronic elements, which were a departure from the band's previous hardcore music. A fourth album, 'Fresh', was released in 2005 and included the singles Cobrastyle and Hey Boy.

Cobrastyle, in particular, has been utilised recently by Heineken in their Meet You There advertising campaign, which debuted worldwide in Singapore. Cobrastyle is also featured as a track in the game FIFA 06. Currently (late 2006) the track "Different Sound" jingles an Intel tv-commercial in Germany. In 2005 and 2006, an advert for Danish bank BRF Kredit used the track "Alma" (from "Fresh") as backing music. Cobrastyle can also be found in the 2006 film "Man Of The Year". 
The song "Different Sound" is also being used for a BBC1 program advertisement in the United Kingdom.
The song "Move Over" from "Rock 'n' Roll Highschool" was featured on a video game "Driv3r" as the main menu soundtrack and a soundtrack from the cutscene.

Ironically, their song Punkrocker ("See me drivin down the street, I'm just not looking good.") is being used in a Cadillac commercial in the United States.

Since around 2006 they've been known simply as Teddybears. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Teddybears+STHLM">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
