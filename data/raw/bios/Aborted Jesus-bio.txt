Aborted Jesus are the Kings of Repulsion. Formed in 2001, the masters began their storied metallic career by recording the 54-song underground demo sensation, "The Immaculate Abortion." At first, there were doubters among the populace, but after hearing tracks like "Papal Smear", "Selling Your Kids Into Slavery", and "Vomit Blizzard", the masses were converted.

Shortly thereafter (in the year 2003), Aborted Jesus started writing their first full length, aptly titled, "Domestic Violence Beach Party." DVBP was a whirlwind attack of death/grind that slayed all the wimps who ever dared to listen. With hits like "Trick-or-Treat Shotgun Blast" and "Molested by Bishops", AJ started receiving volumes of fan mail from around the world. And in 2004, as a tribute to their fans, Aborted Jesus recorded the live EP, "Mouthful of Ticks."

The next 2 years were hard for the Kings of Repulsion. Due to the stress of fame and Prostitumor's horrific drug habit (Geriatric Taint-Huffing), Aborted Jesus decided to take some time off. In the late months of 2006, however, the band reunited to record their sickest, nastiest, and most atrocious opus of all, the 44-song LP, "Carnival of Gonorrhea." This record, influenced by all the dirtiest Crossover, Death Metal, and abhorrent Thrash bands of all time, will surely rip your face off. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aborted+Jesus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
