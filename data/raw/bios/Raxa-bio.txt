An unusual band from Russia in co-operation with  Stefan Hertrich (Spi-Ritual, Shiva in Exile, Betray My Secrets), playing beautiful atmospheric, yet intense music with a certain psychedelic influence, in a style most closely described as Doom Metal/Ethnic Ambient, maybe with some elements of Sympho-Black or smth like that. All elements are harmoniusly blended into a whole thing. 

The band has (presumably?) released 3 albums, 
"Oxlahun Ti Ku" ("Underground Supreme War"),
"Rabinal Achi" (EP) and
"MezoVedic" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Raxa">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
