Formed in late 2004 by the remnants of local metal talent, THRESHOLD, James Coyle (percussion), Taylor Pottle (guitar/vocals) and Kyle Smedley (bass) and joined shortly after by Joel Fowler (guitar – LAZARUS). Shortly after, Joel began playing bass and Ross Williams began playing guitar for the band. The music of AXIS DISRUPT encompasses deadly speed, along with a high degree of melody and complexity. Their musiciansmanship has earned them opportunities to share the stage with many bands.
Currently, AXIS DISRUPT is waiting for the release of their first, independently-recorded album. AXIS DISRUPT urges metal bands or promoters interested in helping organize tours or concerts or wishing to book the band to contact them – via myspace or email: axisdisrupt@hotmail.com
