Karp (1992? - 1998) was a rock band from Tumwater, Washington, USA. The members were Chris Smith, Jared Warren, and Scott Jernigan. They released three full length albums "Mustaches Wild", "Suplex", and "Self Titled LP." (Note that "Self Titled LP" is a literal title. The title is not "Karp." Even the CD version of the record is titled "Self Titled LP.") They also released several EPs and 7" records. Their recordings were released by several Northwest-related labels such as K Records, Kill Rock Stars, and Punk In My Vitamins.

Members went on to form Tight Bros from Way Back When, The Whip, and Big Business. Jared Warren is a currently playing bass for the Melvins. 

Scott Jernigan was killed in a boating accident in 2003.
A documentary film about the band KARP was made in 2009 by Bill Badgley of the band Federation X      http://karplives.com
