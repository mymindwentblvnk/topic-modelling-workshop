Tenspeed Warlock was formed after the collapse(?) of Roanoke by founding member Todd Janeczek and current Roanoke drummer Garret Hubner out of the need to write heavy sludge riffmetal with a definite Entombed/Black Sabbath/ Motorhead feel. With the addition of bassist Brian Houghton they were up and running. Recently Houghton has stepped down and has been replaced by Toby Todd on bass. The three song EP entitled "return of the wolf" is currently available for $5 U.S. and soon a 7" split with Black Pyramid will be available as well.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tenspeed+Warlock">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
