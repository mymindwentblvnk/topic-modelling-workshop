Vök was formed in February 2013 to take part in the Icelandic Music Experiments.

Vök is a young band, formed early 2013. Shortly thereafter they participated in and won the prestigious Icelandic battle of the bands, Músíktilraunir. Subsequently they recorded and released the EP, 'Tension' via Icelandic indie label Record Records.

Prior to forming Vök in February 2013, Margrét Rán and Andri Enoksson had been working together unofficially for quite some time. The third member Ólafur Alexander joined their ranks shortly after and with that the future line-up of Vök was completed.

Vök has been generating a lot of hype in the vibrant music scene of Reykjavík. Their sound consists of dreamy electronics with melodic vocals and distant saxophones. Guitar also plays a prominent role in their sound, placing them a bit more in the realm of indie-electro. 

The trio is currently working on a new EP, set for spring 2015 release. 

Vök have been compared to the likes of The XX and The Knife. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/V%C3%B6k">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
