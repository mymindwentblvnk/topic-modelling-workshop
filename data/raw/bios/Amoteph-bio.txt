In the year 2002 Jonas Backe (guitar player of Impaled (Sweden)) and Sven-Eric Leppäjärvi (singer/guitar player of the former Death or Glory) decided to create a metal band that was different from nowadays mass produced music.
Along with their musical background they created their own sound with in mind that the essential brick would be riffs based on 80’s heavy metal.
Based upon that they started to record a few songs and suddenly the band name Amoteph came up like it had always been there, just waiting to be unleashed.
At the same time as the first demo recordings started, the drummer Nicklas Vanha (Diabolic Lust / Carneous) joined the band and after a few weeks work the first demo cd Curse of Ages was released.
After the demo record was finished Nicklas Vanha left the band, and the duo Jonas Backe and Sven-Eric Leppäjärvi continued with writing material and recording songs for a new cd.
In the year 2004 the demo cd An ancient Prophecy was released. The second record had many improvements both vocally and musically, but nevertheless still with the original Amoteph sound.
The band members make everything themselves, from the songwriting, lyrics and instruments to the recording and mixing etc. Basically you can say everything from the mind to the speaker. That’s the foundation of their heavy metal.
After the second record An Ancient Prophecy Jonas Backe and Sven-Eric Leppäjärvi immediately started to make plans for the third Amoteph record. But as it sometimes goes, plans don’t match up with reality, and because of personal and technical matters the recording has been delayed.
But now as this is written the band is done with the first song for the third upcoming studio album, and if everything goes as planned the new record will be out in spring 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amoteph">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
