2002-2009

Seemless were a stoner rock band formed by ex-Shadows Fall drummer Derek Kerswill, Killswitch Engage vocalist Jesse Leach, ex-Overcast guitarist Pete Cortese, and ex-Medium bassist Jeff Fultz. Hailing from Massachusetts, Seemless is one of the few non-metalcore acts to come out of that area and make a mark on the hard rock scene.

Formed in 2002 following Leach's departure from Killswitch Engage, Seemless was signed to Equal Vision Records, and released their first self-titled LP 2003. They toured extensively over the next year, quickly making a mark on the stoner rock scene with their mixture of soul and blues elements. However, the group never really got out from under the shadow of the acts that the members used to be in until the release of 2006's What Have We Become, which really boosted Seemless into the scene. Tours with the likes of Trivium, The Sword, In Flames, Lacuna Coil, and Fu Manchu garnered Seemless even more recognition, and they are soon to be featured on mainstream radio, with a remixed version of the single Eyes of a Child.


The band announced on 25th June 2009 that they have called it quits. They will be playing their final show in September 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seemless">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
