Thrash/groove metal band from Cranves-Sales in the Rh√¥ne-Alpes area of France, it was formed in the early 90's by guitar player Bertrand Blanchet and drummer Xavier Blanchet. Later rejoined by Philippe Blet on bass and Dave N'Guyen on vocals, this lineup recorded a demo tape called "From Zero..." in 1994 as well as a Maxi-CD titled "Masses In The Rhythm" in 1995.

After a few lineup changes, the band recorded two full-length albums, "'Songs Of Nothing" in 2004 and "3" in 2006.

Most members have also been seen later in a side-project under the "Lysol" moniker.
