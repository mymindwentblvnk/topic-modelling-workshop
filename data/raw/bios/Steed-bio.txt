STEED is a Dutch band with a Liverpudlian accent. The British influence can be found in both style and sound. Catchy tunes with a sharp poprock sound dominate their album ‘Tomorrow Is Never Ending’. The surprising additions of soulful horns, combined with the vintage sound of the Philicorda organ, completes the atmosphere of the songs into a tasteful whole. After successful gigs in Glasgow and Liverpool during 2014, the band is already planning a UK tour in 2015 Manchester, Leeds and London. In association with the magical Judd Lander from LanderPR, STEED is determined to get their sound spread around the UK in 2015! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Steed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
