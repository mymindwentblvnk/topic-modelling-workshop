This project began in early 2007 as the personal expression of guitarist and composer Serge Farinas.

Simbelmyne is inspired by love of ecology and awe of the natural world. It is a pure and abstract expression of raw emotion born of a unique interpretation of reality. 

"all music exists within a social, spatial, and temporal context and all that all those factors have an influence upon the music itself and how it is perceived. The phenomenon of these interactions is what I call the ecology of music. I hope you will join in this mutualistic relationship as I share this dynamic expression of life with you."
