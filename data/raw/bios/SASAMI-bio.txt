SASAMI (Sasami Ashworth) has been making music in the Los Angeles area, in almost every way you can, for the last decade. From playing french horn in orchestras and studios, to playing keys and guitar in local rock bands (Dirt Dress, Cherry Glazerr), to contributing vocals/string/horn arrangements to studio albums (Avi Buffalo, Curtis Harding, Wild Nothing, Hand Habits etc.) and producing tracks for other respected artists (Soko), she has gained a reputation as an all-around musical badass. After graduating from the Eastman School of music in 2012, SASAMI spent her time scoring and making orchestral arrangements for films, commercials and studio albums, as well as being a deeply committed music teacher in Los Angeles. She spent the last two and half years as a so-called “Synth Queen,” touring the world non-stop and making records in the band Cherry Glazerr (on Secretly Canadian) and is taking a turn this year to put out her long anticipated solo album in the fall of 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sasami">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
