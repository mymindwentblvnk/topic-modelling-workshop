FALCONS (ファルコンズ) Southern born, west coast relocated, with production taking inspiration from each. Staying heavily rooted in the bouncey Southern club tempo, fusing it with melodic r&b and hip-hop elements with sprinkles of world music.

With support from DJ and crew’s like Salva, Clicks & Whistles, DJ Benzi, Mad Decent, WeDidIt, DJ Skeet Skeet, LuckyMe, Djemba Djemba, Boiler Room and many more, Its easy to see why Falcons is on many lists of producers/ dj’s to watch in 2013.
