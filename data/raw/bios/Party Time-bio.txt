Party Time, the solo project of Torontonian Emma Moss Brender (also of The Pining), is an unusual handle for music as lonesome as this, but is perhaps not as strange as it might first seem. Parties are generally where friends gather to catch up, share a laugh and enjoy each other's company, but under certain circumstances, parties can be quite emotional events. Maybe you see someone you don't really want to run into, or you realize you don't have an answer when old people ask, "What are you up to these days?" Party Time's first album What Have You Learned? might not be the best soundtrack to any parties proper, but it might just be the perfect thing to listen to on that long walk home when you're feeling weird about life. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Party+Time">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
