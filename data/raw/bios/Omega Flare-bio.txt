Born from the ashes of different bands, Omega Flare is the turning point of every single project from these four guys. Many years have passed and washed away many different band names, but the core of this project still lies in the healthful brotherhood between these fellow musicians and friends. With the arrival of a full-trained, manifold experienced frontman, it was time for change. After a year or so of rehersals and a brief period of recording session, Omega Flare are proud to present their debut EP "A Clockwarp Machinery", with half an hour of entirely original material.
The debut EP let the band share the stage with many bands throughout center and northern Italy, including some world-wide famous acts. Omega Flare has also been selected among more than 2000 bands from all over the world and given the chance to play at Metal Camp 2010 2nd Stage. 

Omega Flare shared the stage, among the others, with CYNIC (US), PINO SCOTTO (IT), THE DEVIL'S BLOOD (NE), OMEGA LITHIUM (SLO), Aceldama (UK), Idols Are Dead (IT), Coram Lethe (IT). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Omega+Flare">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
