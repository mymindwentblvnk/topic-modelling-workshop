San Diego, California's Dirty Gold is '80s afro-guitar influenced project of brothers John and Lincoln Ballif. Music that sounds likes it's taken straight out of a 60's beach flick, complete with squawking seagulls, Beach House-esque guitar riffs, and plenty of warmth.

Their 5-track debut EP 'Roar' was released on April 12, 2011. It is available for download via iTunes and on Dirty Gold's website. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dirty+Gold">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
