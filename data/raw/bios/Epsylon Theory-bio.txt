Epsylon is a neoclassical prog metal band from Paraguay. In November 2012 they have released their first EP called Age of Freedom (www.mediafire.com/?yj9ocgdye05fbbb). The aggressivness of metal, the subtlety of classical music from all ages, and the daring spirit of progressive music finds its way between a operistic lyrical tenor voice and duos between the guitar and the violin to create a unique sound.

Band members:

Carlos Lezcano - Voice
David Moreno - Keyboards
Fernando Duarte Cuetto - Bass
Pablo Campos - Violin
Fabrizio Pomata - Guitar
Rafael Arce - Drums
