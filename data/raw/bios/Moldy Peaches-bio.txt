The Moldy Peaches were an indie group from New York City, New York, USA, founded by Adam Green and Kimya Dawson. Leading proponents of the anti-folk scene, the band has been on hiatus since 2004. The appearance of their song "Anyone Else But You" in the film Juno has significantly raised their profile; Dawson and Green made a handful of reunion appearances together in December 2007.

The band is known for their slow-paced songs, often discussing themes of childhood or young adulthood. Dawson's distinctive, childlike voice contributes to their distinctive sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Moldy+Peaches">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
