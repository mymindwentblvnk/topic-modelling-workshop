Taking root in early thrash and death metal, and combined with dark, foreboding ambiance, Seeds of Perdition strives to create a more atmospheric style of death/thrash metal. While the trend in extreme music today is towards technicality and virtuosity, Seeds presents a more raw and intense sound that gives a simpler, yet heavier vibe.
