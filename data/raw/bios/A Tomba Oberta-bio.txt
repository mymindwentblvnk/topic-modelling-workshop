DEATH-PUNK band started in 2012 in Barcelona, Catalonia (Spain), which its sound remind a lot punk bands such as Discharge, Amebix or Misery, but also they have huge influences of the classic death-metal like Entombed, Obituary or Paradise Lost. In 2014 they made  their debut album "La venjança ens fa viure", which doesn´t seem a debut but at all, but a mature work cause its high quality sound, good technical level, etc.
