Countless Skies burst onto the metal scene with their self-titled EP in late 2014. Blending progressive and darkly intense music influenced by their Scandinavian melodeth heroes, the EP received acclaim worldwide and began a flood of shows up and down their native UK with multiple highlights including an invitation to Bloodstock Open Air 2015.

Building upon their rapid momentum, the band soon caught the attention of Kolony Records, a deal was signed and the band began work on their debut full length. New Dawn was released June 2016 and was praised "as an effortless display of bravado and musicianship in ways that I can't soundly describe," by USA's New Noise Magazine and an impressive debut from the UK's Metal Hammer. "Countless Skies have what it takes to really blossom in to something original and beautiful... a band with great skill and even greater potential," stated Zero Tolerance Magazine. 

With applause the world over following the release of New Dawn, the band embarked on a UK tour with Finland's 'Whispered'. Several shorter tours followed including their first stints abroad, appearing at multiple European festivals such as Dark Troll Festival, Skaldenfest, and MetalDays.

In August 2020 the band announced they had joined forces with Willowtip Records for the release of their second album, Glow. The follow-up to 2016's full-length debut New Dawn, Glow takes the band's progressive brand of melodeth to new heights with richly-layered instrumentation, superb musicianship and raw emotion. Thematically, Glow is based on the album's epic title track, a 20-minute opus split into three parts.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Countless+Skies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
