Arteria is a ensemble coming from Mexico City, whose music can be described as Rock in Opposition, blending chamber music with avant-garde and improvisations. 
The creation of this project is the result of the conjunction of four trained and talented Mexican musicians who have been creating original music in different bands such as Nazca, Iconoclasta and Culto sin nombre, reaching more than 30 albums recorded so far between them.

Arteria are Juan Carlos Ruiz - bassoon, Adolfo Zaragoza - guitars, VÃ­ctor Baldovinos - drums, and Mari Carmen Graue - cello. Their debut album saw the light in 2011, entitled Cuatro visiones, with ten compositions in which you will find exquisite arrangements, restless and somber music full of a diversity of nuances and textures, which will surely give you a moment of reflection and self-conciousness.
