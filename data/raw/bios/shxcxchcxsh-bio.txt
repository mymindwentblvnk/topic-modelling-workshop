Little is known of the vowel-avoiding duo, except they are from Norrk√∂ping, Sweden and sometimes perform live. To date, their subtle, benevolent brand of techno has appeared on labels including Semantica, Subsist and Avian, with the latter having released the three full length albums "STRGTHS" (2013), "Linear S Decoded" (2014) and "SsSsSsSsSsSsSsSsSsSsSsSsSsSsSs" (2016), as well as several EPs. Their sound is consistently melodic, fuzzy and transcendental. Their essence is spellbinding. It's not without irony that they use titles without vowels: their sound embodies the unseen. The listener is compressed into their black hole of sound. The track titles on STRGTHS are typically scrambled, yet playful, with names such as "RSRRCTN" (Resurrection?), "LVNGWTR" (Living Water?), "WHTLGHT" (White Light?), and "LTTLWLF" (Little Wolf?).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SHXCXCHCXSH">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
