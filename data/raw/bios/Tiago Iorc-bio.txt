Tiago Iorc (born November 28, 1985) is a Brazilian musician, singer-songwriter and recording artist. As a child he lived in England and in the United States, 
and this would later determine his choice of singing and writing in English. 
Despite having no musical background in his family, Tiago started playing the acoustic guitar at age 8.

In 2007 his unpretentious acoustic single 'Nothing but a Song' drew attention to 
his voice and led to the release of his debut album Let Yourself In, which gained notoriety after several of Tiago's songs were featured on major Brazilian primetime soap operas, TV ads and films. Tiago soon started touring across the country and in 2009 was Jason Mraz's Brazilian Tour opening act.

Let Yourself In was also released in Japan, where 'Nothing But a Song' peaked at number 11 on Billboard's Japan HOT 100 Chart, and in South Korea, where the public granted Tiago a Best Foreign Artist Award for his performance at the 2010 Grand Mint Festival. Another single — 'Fine' — featured on the popular South Korean TV series Personal Taste.

His second studio album Umbilical — which had New York-based Andy Chase as producer — was simultaneously released in Brazil, South Korea and Portugal on October 2011. Digital releases in the United States and Japan followed shortly after. 

The Umbilical Tour had it's debut on March 14th at the 2012 South by Southwest Music Festival in Austin, Texas, and included performances in Portugal and over 20 sold out dates in Brazil. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tiago+Iorc">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
