Mario Strack is a composer, performer and producer of "lyrical electro rock" - cross genre, cross era.
Born 4. 23. 1956 in Graz (Austria)
Autodidact since he left school in the early 70's, he became a member in several rockbands and toured with them playing the keyboards. 
During the 80's he did lots of work as a composer and music producer for small indie-labels and major companies with his own Band "Luna Set" as well as with various other artists.
With the beginning of the 90's he decided to go back to perfect independence.
Together with his wife, the painter Jacqueline Ditt, he founded "universal arts" as an art market concept, containig a gallery, a print edition, a record label and a production-studio.
Expanding to visual arts, Mario Strack started creating audiovisual clips with the electronic media. His style is known as "Illustrated Music" - a combination of "lyrical electro rock" - songs and moving pictures - that expands the artwork to a multisensual experience.
Today he lives and works as a free artist in Munich (Germany). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mario+Strack">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
