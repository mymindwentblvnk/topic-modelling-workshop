After Therapy is the brainchild of vocalist "Screaming Mad" Dee Calhoun and guitarist Charlie Johnston, who began their musical workings in 2001 with After Forever, a Black Sabbath tribute.

Much like the band they paid tribute to, After Therapy's assault offers no frills or pretentiousness; it is metal the way it should be played--buzzsaw chunky guitar riffs, a concussive rhythm section, and ear-shattering vocals.

Fans of bands like Sabbath, Judas Priest and Down love After Therapy's searing classic metal roar. Fans of more contemporary heavy bands love After Therapy's knuckle-dragging low-tuned heavy sound.

After Therapy are now booking shows in support of their second CD, Torn With The Teeth, which was unleashed in January 2010.
