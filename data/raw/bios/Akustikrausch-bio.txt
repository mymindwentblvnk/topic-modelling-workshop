Akustikrausch is a live music project by Andreas Wendorf who has already made himself a name through heavy weight productions, shaking up club dance floors throughout his native Germany. Before launching Akustikrausch, Andreas produced “Abteilung Ton” and enjoyed a huge success mixing Techno Beats with German lyrics. Akustikrausch is a new solo project that breaks all the rules of traditional club music by melting various electronic music styles into one unique sound, cake pounding heavy on the dance floors… His musical repertoire includes thumping club smashers and poppy electro tunes showing the variety of his persona and once again underlining his motto: "music is my passion".  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Akustikrausch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
