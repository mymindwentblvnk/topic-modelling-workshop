1. Textured and ambient doom metal from the underbelly of Auckland city, New Zealand.  Formed 2010.

Shallow Grave features members who have played in seasoned New Zealand doom and metal bands; The House of Capricorn, Graymalkin, Ulcerate, Asphyxiate and Somme. Their live performance is second to none in monolithic, hyptonically bleak, downtuned heaviness. 

"When Shallow Grave play live they ruin the eternally amped guy's existence."

2. Shallow Grave is also a metal band based out of Stony Brook University.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shallow+Grave">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
