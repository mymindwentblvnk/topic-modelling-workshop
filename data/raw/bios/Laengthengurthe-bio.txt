Laengthengurthe is a band from Boise, Idaho that combines elements of grindcore, metal, and punk rock. Originally started in 2001 as a casual recording project, Laengthengurthe recorded and produced three early releases: "Pink and Black (like the inside of a dog's mouth)", "Rumpelforeskin", and "Lack of Additional Limbs". These early releases were distributed in a DIY fashion and were very limited in production. In 2011, 1332 Records released a 10 year cd entitled "An Uncomfortable Amount of Laengthengurthe." This release includes 73 remastered tracks spanning the years 2001-2011. In 2012, Laengthengurthe released a split cd with another Boise band, "Pile Of Maggot Infested Viscera". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Laengthengurthe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
