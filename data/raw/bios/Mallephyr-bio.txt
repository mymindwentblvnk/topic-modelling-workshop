The cornerstone of the black/death metal horde MALLEPHYR was layed at the end of year 2013, when the trio Opat, Tom, Adam started to work on the first songs. They had the clear vision beforehand, which direction to follow and what they wanted to express. 

In Summer 2014, MALLEPHYR were joined by bass-guitarist Sinneral and the unit was complete. They performed the first gig on 12th September in Pilsen at Diabolical Fest IV. In next two months, they played as a support of Norwegian band VULTURE INDUSTRIES, also appeared at open-air festival Onion Fest and performed for the first time in Prague.

MALLEPHYR released two-track demo „Demo 2014“ on 17th December, which was intended as a presentation of the new formation on the Czech underground scene. It is available for free on various band’s profiles – Bandzone, Bandcamp, Soundcloud, Youtube. Production, mix and mastering was made by Karel „Sheafraidh“ Švejnoha at KSV Studios in Prague.
