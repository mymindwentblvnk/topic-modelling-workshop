Keep in mind! There are two acts called Subwave:

1. SUBWAVE (Drum&Bass DJ/Producer  from Moscow/Russia)

Real name: Gleb Soloviev

Gleb started to make music with production partner Alexander Rotov over ten years ago, grabbing the attention of the late John Peel no less, with a debut release on Tech Itch recordings in 2001. 
More tunes followed including a remix of TiÃ«sto's Flight 643 (with Paul B) getting attention stateside.
After that Gleb went solo and his friend Alexander Rotov went on producing minimal techno under the alias Stop Thinking.
Gleb's first solo as Subwave was a 12" on Goldie's Metalheadz Label.
Not only a talented Producer, Gleb is also held in high regard as both a DJ and Promoter, and was involved in the first "Hospitality" night in Russia in 2006. He has gone on to promote the massive "Refreshed" night in Moscow's "Propaganda" nightclub with DJ Vipah, as well as DJing all over Russia and across Europe. 2009 sees Subwave elevate into the top D+B bracket, and with two awesome tracks on Hospital's Future Sound of Russia, he impressed the Hospital A+R team.
Successfully marrying ice cold minimalism with wide open dancefloor sonics, and with huge support from the likes of Hype, Fabio, London Elektricity and of course Goldie, expect more Subwave in your system shortly.
