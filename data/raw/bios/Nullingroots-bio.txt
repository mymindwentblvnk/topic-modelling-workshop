Originally established as a one man project under the name Solus in mid 2012. Solus released an EP and two full-length albums almost all within the same year. In early 2014, Solus recruited all necessary positions in order to create a full line up. With the formation of a full line up followed a name change to nullingroots. nullingroots is currently in the production of their debut full-length.
