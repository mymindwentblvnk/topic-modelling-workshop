ABYSSARIA is a German dark metal band ("abysm(et)al" or "Abyss Metal" as the musicians calls it themselves) founded in 1998. So far, the group released three albums: "Beyond The Darklands" (1999), "All The Dying On Earth" (2001) and "Architecture Of Chaos" (2003). After a four-years-break, singer Mephir and keyboardist Atiscon rejoined the band in 2007 (which they left in the meantime). With new bass player Irathor, Abyssaria is ready to strike back onto stage again! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abyssaria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
