Kitty is the name of more than one artist:

1) Kitty Ray (born Kathryn-Leigh Beckwith), known mononymously as Kitty (formerly Kitty Pryde and ♡kitty♡), is a musician from Florida, United States. Kitty began making music in 2010, which she shared via Tumblr. In 2011, she fronted the short-lived comedy hip-hop group Jokers in Trousers, and received recognition from rapper Riff Raff. The pair collaborated on a song, "Orion's Belt," in June 2012. Kitty's 2012 single "Okay Cupid" became an internet sensation, and was ranked number 17 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the top 50 songs of 2012.

Between 2012 and 2014, Kitty released a string of extended plays. The first three—Haha, I’m Sorry (2012), D.A.I.S.Y. rage (2013), and impatiens (2014)—were predominantly hip-hop-based. In November 2014, Kitty declared that she was “over hip-hop”, and explored trance on the EP FROSTBITE.

In 2017, Kitty released her debut album, Miami Garden Club. The album was crowdfunded through a Kickstarter campaign in 2015. It saw Kitty shift to a new synthpop sound, and was inspired by '80s and '90s pop music. With this project, Kitty—formerly a rapper primarily—tried her hand at singing and music production.

Kitty’s second album, ROSE GOLD, was released in 2019. It was her first release to be entirely self-produced. The album reached number 9 on Billboard's Dance/Electronic Albums charts.

In addition to her solo work, Kitty is also a member of the groups The Pom-Poms and Teen Suicide  (the latter was known for a period of time as American Pleasure Club), alongside her husband Sam Ray (a.k.a. Ricky Eat Acid). Between 2016 and 2018, Kitty and Ray also collaborated on music under the names 56colors and Kit & Sam Ray.

Kitty formed her own record label, Pretty Wavvy, in 2019. In 2020, she released an EP titled Charm and Mirror.

2) Caitlin Murphy-Page, known mononymously as Kitty, is a singer-songwriter born in Dublin, Ireland and based London, England. Her music draws upon the styles of soul, jazz, R&B, and pop.
