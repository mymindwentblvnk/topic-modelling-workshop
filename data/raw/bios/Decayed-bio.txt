Decayed is one of the most important bands in the history of the portuguese black metal scene, along with Filii Nigrantium Infernalium and Moonspell (ex-Morbid God). They were born from the ashes of Decay, back in 1990, having played all around Portugal and Europe. Their discography is as large as their historical weight and totally voted to occultism and satanism. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Decayed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
