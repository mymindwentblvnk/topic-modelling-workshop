LA artist Wallice looks set to take the music scene by storm with her uniquely candid indie pop sound. Sounding revitalised and as fresh as anything that we have heard in the last few months, Wallice has firmly entrenched herself in the hearts and minds of listeners with the release of her singles ‘Punching Bag’ and now ’23’. There is a relatable heart to her sound that when compounded with its infectious and affable melodies, makes for a thoroughly enjoyable and rousing listening experience. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wallice">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
