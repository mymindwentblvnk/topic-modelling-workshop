long time friends, drummer Adrian played in a previous project with bassist Gustavo and due to creative differences between other members they all separated. Then guitarist Sarah and Gustavo began a project together in which later Adrian joined with us to form MidNightMare in early 2006 in the small town of Sanger, CA. Nick, a friend of ours for sometime, was welcomed to become our lead vocalist in september of 2006. We are all very dedicated to what we do; wanting to give back to music what music has given to us. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Midnightmare">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
