Mondstille was founded in 2004 by Markus (Wrath) and David (Leandín).
Between 2005 and 2006 the band began to take more concrete forms. The first instrumental ideas came into being consisting of melodious acoustic and heavy e-guitars. It was decided, to round this concept with vocals in their german motherlanguage.
Phil (P.) joined the band in early 2006 and so the drums were manned. The band was nearly completed now and the first songs were finished. For the debut acoustic live concert with Dornenreich they could recruit the very talented musicians Iris (Víndsvôl, Flute) and Ludwig (Lundár, Violin).

After this successful concert the band focused on writing further songs and the release of their first album. Thanks to P.`s energetic support the band could perform some concerts with well known bands, gathering more stage experience. The time had come to enter the studios. They decided to record their debut album at the Soulsick Records Studios. Little by little the acoustic songs and after a short break the heavier e-guitar songs were recorded.

Because the drums were unoccupied at this time they had to recruit a session guest for this task. Fortunately they could recruit Krimh (Thorns Of Ivy) who was the best person for this job. Now the release date for the album is coming closer but before this, the heavier songs will be re-mastered by Stefan Fasan because the band was quite displeased with the sound.
The finished album called Am Ende... (At the end...) will be released by White Bird Productions.
