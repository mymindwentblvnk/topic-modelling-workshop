With The White Wizard, Kult of Wizard have brought unto us a monumental statement of intricate doom and a discerning taste for the heavy, having upped the ante with these colossal rituals of Olde Fashioned Black Magik.
 Stoner doom that is dark, eeire and magnificent.. Riffs build layer on layer giving the music depth and an atmosphere that is further enhanced by the haunting banshee wails of vocalist Mahle Roth.
