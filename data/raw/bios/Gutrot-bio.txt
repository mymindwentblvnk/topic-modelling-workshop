There are 2 bands called Gutrot:

1) Gutrot is  a brutal death metal gore band from United States. They formed in 2003 by Jon Halcomb (guitar) and Brian Forge (vocals) as sideproject who were both members of the US band Mulch. They found Zach Gibson (drums) when they saw his band Cutrate playing a show at a local bar and then invited Kevin Carron (bass), who was also playing in Mulch, to join the side project.

The band was completed and set out to create gore infested brutal death metal and released a 2 song demo with a good solid sound and sick guttural vocals. Their second was a split CD with Dysentery which was much groovier than the previous release and includes blasting drum sections and technical splatter gore vocals. However, despite this, the band split due to financial difficulties.

2) D-Beat/Crust band from Wellington, New Zealand
