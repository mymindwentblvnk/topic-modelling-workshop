More psychobabble madness from the kings at Funeral Folk. What do you expect with a name like Chainsaw Gutsfuck? Mind-splattering noise, that's what. Thankfully, the Funeral Folkies deliver in droves. This short tape is laced in feedback and massive, distorted guitar swells. Chainsaw Gutsfuck is overpowering. There's enough energy here to bring down an entire Belgian village, so country-dwellers in the lowlands beware. On the second track, we get some percussive bursts that richochet in the cracks of guitar fodder. It just screams and screams, begging to be put down like a lame horse. Glue factory, ahoy! God, this is fucked. Some phasing action gives hints at CJA's recent montages, but the similarities end there. This is some scary shit. The third track is more of the same, though in a more rapidfire approach. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/chainsaw+gutsfuck">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
