Ugly Ogre has been marching on since August 8th 1995 in Tartu. During the first five years the line-up was stabile and the band played death/thrash metal with lyrics in Estonian.
During the following five years the line-up as well as the style had undergone some changes. The style floated around folk metal. In 2005 the band split up and was reanimated in 2006 with almost original line-up.
The band is again playing death/thrash metal with lyrics in Estonian. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ugly+Ogre">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
