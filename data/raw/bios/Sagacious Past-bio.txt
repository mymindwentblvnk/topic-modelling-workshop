This is Sagacious Past, hard rock/metal band from the San Francisco Bay area. The band is comprised of 5 people from all over the bay, each of them are significantly different but when together they create something unique, something solid, something much more than themselves. Thier interests are far and wide but one thing they all share in common is their love for Metal.
Formed in early 2008, they have already played in front of thousands. Since their start they have released 1 EP "Sagacious Past County EP" and just this past june 09, released their first LP "Caught in the Present"
All of their tracks have literally gone through hours of attention, rehearsal and stage play, to get them right. 
Their sound is very diverse, having strong influences from older thrash metal bands such as Megadeth and Metallica and having the prominent edge of current Metal and rock bands such as Slipknot and Sentenced. However their sound can not be pinpointed and can only be summed up as Sagacious Past.

 "We hope you all enjoy our tunes as much as it was for us to make them and play them, they are fueled by our hearts."
