We are a progressive metal band from Richmond, Virginia. Take six terrestrial beings with a deep interest in cosmology and an even deeper desire to write original sounding music and Crossing The Event Horizon is born. We just finished our EP and are currently working on lots of new material that we hope to finish and start playing/recording for you guys soon. Until then we hope you enjoy the tunes we have up!
