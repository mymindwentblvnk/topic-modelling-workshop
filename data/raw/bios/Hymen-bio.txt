HYMEN is a solo project started in early 2008 by ANT (based in northwest UK) after several failed attempts at making music within a group. Generally unheard of and considered a 'musical recluse' due to minimal appearances and lack of releases. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hymen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
