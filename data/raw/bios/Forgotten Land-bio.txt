Forgotten Land began in the winter of 2003 under rule of Lord Raven Tetrarch.
All instruments and samples are done alone, only in extreme isolation. Many themes of winter and cosmic wandering is heard throughout the ambient winds of the music. No one has ever seen Lord Raven Tetrach, for a mere man would shudder in his starkness. Lord Raven Tetrarch also heads the front of Dungeons Deep Records.

Hugin of the Austrian ambient project Uruk-Hai has done an introduction for Forgotten Land on "Ancient Runic Sorcery". Future collaboration is planned. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Forgotten+Land">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
