Sorrowfall are a Belfast based "epic, blackened" metal band, formed in April 2004 by Chris Collins and Steve Reynolds with Chris Polin and Conor Edgar completing the four piece line-up. The band wasted no time diving headlong into the metal abyss and began writing and gigging original material shortly after their initial conception.

In 2004 Sorrowfall released their first demo entitled "Welcome To The Killing Floor" however it was the follow up release, 2005's "Insanity's Memoirs" which really hearalded the arrival of the Sorrowfall horde. This release proved to be a massive step up from its predecessor and was met with praise throughout the Irish metal fraternity and recieved a number of glowing reviews both home and abroad. Shortly after the release of Insanity's Memoirs in 2005 the BBC commissioned the production of the first ever Sorrowfall music video for airing on "Across The Line Television" broadcast on BBC2 N.I.

To date Sorrowfall has gigged extensively throughout Ireland and landed appearances alongside established international acts such as ARMORED SAINT, GREEN CARNATION, ONSLAUGHT, DESASTER, MOONSORROW, SHE SAID DESTROY and SKYFORGER to name a few.

In August 2006 the band entered the studio and recorded their debut full-length album entitled "Prayers of the Faithless" which after many frustrating delays was released on 03/08/07 the following year.

The band recently debuted in Europe in March 2009 with two shows in Belgium with Thurisaz and at FrontFest VII. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sorrowfall">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
