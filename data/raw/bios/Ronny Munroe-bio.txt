RONNY MUNROE - THE FIRE WITHIN

Ronny Munroe's "Fire Within" was created the way a true metal album should be—with nothing but spirit. Frustrated, unable to tour with Metal Church (on hiatus), and forced to relocate from L.A., Ronny found himself back in Seattle. What was originally supposed to be a 2009 festival-headlining tour with Metal Church turned out to be one man, forced to decide between joining society as a “9-to-5'er" or creating a new vision. Ronny chose his path—with “pen in hand” and an indomitable spirit, he sat in his small apartment and drew from "The Fire Within." 

Track one, "Far," is an opener like no other, an undeniable force which sets the pace for a redefinition of metal that reminds us why Ronny fronts the legendary band Metal Church. From start to finish this passionate offering takes you on a true metal journey. With a little help from guests like Michael Wilton (Queensryche) on "Sea of Souls" and "What You Choose to Call Hell (I Call Home),” Randy Cooper (THC Texas Hippie Coalition) on "Ride Me, and the brilliant work of MC Guitarist Rick Van Zandt, "The Fire Within" establishes itself as a force to be reckoned with.

When was the last time you bought a metal album that was anything other than just "ok?" In the tradition of solo albums which speak to the very souls of us, such as Halford’s "Resurrection" or Bruce Dickenson’s "Chemical Wedding"—masterpieces in their own right—“The Fire Within” is guaranteed to get your fists pumping and your soul electrified. This vibrant twelve-track offering is no joke and no lie. It's true, it's pure, it's in-your-face, and will satisfy metal lovers from any genre. Co-produced by Kurt Vanderhoof and Ronny himself, this powerful release will stand the test of time! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ronny+Munroe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
