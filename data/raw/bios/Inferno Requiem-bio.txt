Inferno Requiem is known as the one and only true underground raw and depressive black metal band in Taiwan. Formed in 1999 by sole member Fog, the band released debut album "Gloomy Night Stories" in 2007, which set a milestone for the Asian black metal scene. The successful combination of early Northern Europe raw style mixed with current USBM depressive/suicidal elements, added by the themes of Ancient Chinese mythology and personal supernature approach, all made Inferno Requiem an unique subject among black metal bands worldwide. Simply put, there is not ever going be a band like Inferno Requiem in Taiwan. Not a chance.
