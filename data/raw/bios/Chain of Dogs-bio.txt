Chain of Dogs have a go at the underbelly of folk music to get to its guts, and serve them to you in a bloody mix with thrash metal and horror punk. Blending the traditional with the loud these bastard werewolves will leave you crushed in their wake like Orcs in Tiger tanks. No remorse, no regrets. 

If you hear the howling, be sure the Dogs are near.
