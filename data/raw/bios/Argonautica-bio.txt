Argonautica was a short lived band that was created by 3 teenagers in Central Florida to experiment with their musical ideas. The band was functional from 2006 - 2008 (roughly) and released a few demos on the internet. Shows were performed in a couple small venues around the area but nothing ever evolved. The members have split up and followed different paths. Jay Lock, the guitars/vocals of the band, is starting his senior year in high school and still pursues music, though with different people. Cody Armstrong plays drums for a few unstable death metal bands, and Chris Marino (bass) has joined the Navy and is somewhere near the Chicago area. 

This band no longer exists. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Argonautica">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
