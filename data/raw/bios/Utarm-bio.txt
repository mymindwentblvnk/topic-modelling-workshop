Utarm was a project that has been dwelling for years,without finding its right form. Various black metal and ambient bands..projects was tried out through the nineties, but the constallations of people never worked,and it was clear that a oneman project was the only solution. Human relations seems to be a constant failure.in the early years of the new millenium the beast found its ugly shape. Not wanting to make the classic Black Metal, neither Noise or Doom, but creating true satanic desperation not bound by musical structures. Through Utarm the darker shadows of humanity can be found, a mirror to reflect the black holes and misery of oneself. Humans tend to avoid this side of their personality, therfore most humans does not have the caracteristics of a whole person, just shallow creatures who use their time to try and forget their unavoidable death. When confronted with utarm this is not longer possible. Total darkness concentrated to audial spikes of hate, and these spikes will penetrate you.....
