Tzelmoth is a raw black metal band, total underground cult, born in 1999. For 2005 they published their first demo "Unholy Throne," which was given only 34 people. For 2007, Tzelmoth presented its second demo, "Tzelmoth" with two songs recorded in studio. There have been few public presentations of this band, this being a total discharge of raw power and metal. Agars is the leading vocalization, whose style (and the style of his bandmates) within the genre poses as crude.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tzelmoth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
