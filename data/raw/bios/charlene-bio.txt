Several artists use this name:

1) American singer Charlene (Oliver, née D'Angelo) - best known for her 1976 sleeper hit single, I've Never Been To Me, which reached #97 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. In 1982, renewed interest in the song led to the single reaching #3 in the USA and #1 in the UK. The song also reached #1 in Australia in 1983 for six weeks.

2) Charlene (also Charlene Meulenberg) is an artist from the Netherlands who finished third in Season 4 (2008) of the Dutch Idols singing competition, but who was favored by many fans and the musical team behind Wouter Hamel and Giovanca (Dox Records), whom she signed with after the competition. She has already released her debut album, Charlene, with the label.

3) Charlene is the name used by an indie/shoegaze/pop group from Newton, Massachusetts which released its self-titled debut album, Charlene in 2002. Their most recent release was the single, Oh Hey (2008).

Charlene is an indie rock band that originated in Allston, Massachusetts in the latter half of the 1990s. The group has released three seven inch singles, an eponymous debut album and, most recently, a digital-only single. The band's esthetic sense has been likened to the shoegazing scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s with favorably drawn comparisons to Slowdive, Spiritualized, and Ride as well as post-punk touchstones like New Order and the Jesus and Mary Chain.

The band began as a four-track recording project between friends, Matt Mirande and John (Randy) Rex in 1996. early recording activity produced a trio of 7" singles self released under their own SharkAttack! imprint (also responsible for 7" and CD releases by the bands, Lockgroove and Compass), the first of which was enthusiastically compared to Spacemen 3 in Brainwashed.  By 2002 Charlene (now expanded to a four piece with the addition of Ian Lawrence [drums] and Kelly Ferguson [bass]) released their eponymous debut album, again under the SharkAttack! label. East Coast tours with Bloodthirsty Lovers and Mark Gardener (ex-Ride) were undertaken to promote the debut, while Boston area support slots for touring acts such as Bedhead, Low, Elf Power, Fridge, Her Space Holiday and American Analog Set provided additional exposure.

Since 2005 a fluctuating lineup (Rex and Mirande remain the only permanent members) has made live shows sporadic, although a tour was undertaken with the band Sons (Chapel Hill) in July of 2007. In 2008 recordings were completed on a second full length album (with a release expected later in 2010) entitled, Our Friends Electric. A digital-only single, "Oh Hey" was released as a teaser in November of 2008.
