On 24th July 1999 at the Gyan Manch auditorium in Kolkata, a group of creative musicians took the stage for the first time , expressing their music as Bhoomi. The original simple lyrics, lilting melodies, aptly enmeshed with the use of a wide range of acoustic instruments, brought in with them a fresh sound that had its own identity. People identified with the music. Today the music of Bhoomi has managed to touch millions of hearts across generations and languages.
