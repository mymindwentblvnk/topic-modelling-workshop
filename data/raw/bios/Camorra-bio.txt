There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Camorra  

Metalcore band from Manchester, UK.


Camorra played numerous gigs between 2006-9, and were lucky enough to get to play with some amazing bands.. 

sick of it all, madball, terror, the red chord, walls of jericho, evergreen terrace, dead to fall, shai hulud, dead hearts, good clean fun, comeback kid, 25 ta life, gallows, parkway drive, from a second story window, bring me the horizon, the seventh cross, suicide silence, job for a cowboy, knights of the abyss, abigail williams, ion dissconece, textures, eternal lord, winds of plague, send more paramedics, enter shikari, devil sold his soul, azriel, shaped by fate, your demise, the break in, bossk, narcosis, flood of red, d-rail and LOTS of others 

The EP released by Calculated Risk Products had some good reviews, 4K's from Kerrang! and 8.5 from Terroriser Magazine. Metal Hammer gave it 6/10, but who are they to judge?

A 2nd EP should have been released by FETO records but the band split before hand.

Camorra released Guidance Demo in 2005 and two tracks on Lahti Hardcore Punk -compilation "Hometown Pride". They disbanded few years back, but are playing one show 9.4 in Lahti, the rest will be question mark if the band continues from that point.
