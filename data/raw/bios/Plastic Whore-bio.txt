ABOUT/BIO
Since 2002, Plastic Whore has been a solo operation for Jarmo Nuutre - member of Odota, Blood Pavilion, Skull Trading.

Started as an industrial-metal act, it's been moving between various shapes and sometimes even had different names for different moods - Via Whore & Hormonia for example.
Basically ideas been all around techno, drum'n'bass, drone, 8bit, metal, rock and whatnot. 

In the early days made all his music with just an old 586 Pentium laptop and guitar, using simple music making program SoundClub (running in MS-DOS), that was actually meant for the children and made in Estonia.
SoundClub was magical, it could sound like suicide.

Besides his own releases, Jarmo has also been involved in making a music for one theatreplay and short movie, as well as remixing other artists - Liquido (GER), Under Marie (EST), Agent M (EST), Soterios (EST), Slide-Fifty (EST), Talbot (EST), ToeTag (EST), Tomasz Wiracki (PL) and so on.
