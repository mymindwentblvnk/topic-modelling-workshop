Terrorway was born in 2008, on the initiative of two members and founders ( with Stefano Porceddu ) of a band called Cataria, ended in september 2007 after internal problems: Ivan Fois ( guitars ) and Cosma Secchi ( drums ).

They were soon added the singer Anselmo” Memo” Mascia, while searching for the bass player appears difficult and ends only in February 2009 with entry into the band of Giovanni Serra.

The intention of the band is to give life to a deadly mix of what in recent years we have heard from various: Meshuggah, Lamb of God, Dillinger escape plan, and yet, Pantera, still trying to stay very personal songwriting.

Currently the band is involved in recording a demo and in the composition of songs that will be part of the first album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Terrorway">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
