Stack Bundles, born Rayquon Elliott, (October 21, 1982 - June 11, 2007) was a mixtape rapper plucked from the streets of Far Rockaway Queens and placed on the mixtape circuit where he entertained thousands over a years time before going through a bidding war where he landed with Jim Jones’s MOB (Members of Byrdgang ) camp with fellow rapper Max B.
Bundles burst onto the rap scene after signing to DJ Clue?’s Desert Storm Records, joining artists such as Fabolous and Joe Budden. He gained more fame after he brazenly approached Dipset charter member Jim Jones and asked the Harlem-based rapper to promote him. Impressed, Jones helped Bundles compile a series of mixtapes and collaborations.
Unfortunately, he was shot once in the head and once in the neck as he entered the lobby of his Far Rockaway building just before 6 a.m. on June 11, 2007. Accompanied by a friend, Bundles was returning to his home in Redfern Houses on Beach Channel Drive after a night performing and socializing at Club Stereo in Manhattan’s Chelsea section.
The friend parted ways with Bundles in the building’s lobby and told investigators that he heard shots moments later. He ran back to the building only to find Bundles bleeding heavily just steps from his first-floor apartment.
Bundles’ wallet, which contained both cash and credit cards, was still on the slain rapper’s body, though one of his medallions had been taken, the friend told police. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stack+Bundles">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
