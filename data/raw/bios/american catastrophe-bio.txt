Stemming from former bands such as The Black Water, Sky Burial, Sister Mary Rotten Crotch, among others, American Catastrophe explores the americana, the rural grit, the murderer and the romantic. A world of the seedy where one can die choking on the dove of peace or be beaten to death by a bouquet of roses. American Catastrophe has most commonly been described as "Dark Americana" and have shared the stage with the likes of Slim Cessna's Auto Club, Munly and the Lee Lewis Harlots, The Reverend Glasseye, Humanwine, The Veils, The Ponys and many more. Their first album "Excerpts from the Broken Bone Choir" has received excellent reviews from Pitchfork, popmatters, AMG, among others; debuted on the CMJ charts at 166 and has received international radio play.
