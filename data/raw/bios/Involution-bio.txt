There are 2 groups that go by the name Involution.

1)Involution are rock/metal band from Belfast, Ireland formed in 2001. Influenced by Tool, Mastodon, Alice In Chains, Earthtone9, Pantera and Faith No More the band have drawn comparisons to Corrosion Of Conformity, Stone Temple Pilots and A Perfect Circle... 

They released 3 EPs in their time and disbanded in 2006, some of the member then went on to form Electric Red

"Involution are clearly sworn into the fierce brotherhood of sound. The volume does not relent and the riffage is savage. Way back, Faith No More made the connection between pummelling rock and alternative attitudes, and Involution are their healthy, squalling grandchildren."  - BBC Radio Ulster, Nov 2004

2)Involution is an experimental electronic group made up of cEvin Key (of Skinny Puppy) and Paris Sedonis (from Christian Death and Shadow Project).  They only released one self titled album on Tone Casualties Records in 1998.

from the inside cover of the CD:

"We come from the center and circumference of everything, radiating, drawing forth the Divine Influx. Together through our cosmic conceptions, we sublimate Omnipresence for all existing in and out this mirror of matter; who trusts and believes. 'Cause when our brainclouds glisten - and our eyes glide aside - our frequencies mesh - and thorugh our vibes, all consciousize.
It is done unto you as you believe.
What it does for us - it must do through us. Trust the invisible - for it is the sole cause of which is visible. Nothing moves but mind."
