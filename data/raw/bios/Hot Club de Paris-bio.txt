Hot Club de Paris are an indie-rock trio from Liverpool, Merseyside consisting of Paul Rafferty (vocals/bass/baritone guitar), Matthew Smith (guitar/vocals) and his brother Alasdair Smith (drums/vocals).  Inspired by such diverse groups as Owls, Storm and Stress, Pavement, Don Caballero, Joan of Arc, Les Savy Fav, Minutemen, Black Flag, XTC and Talking Heads, they create fast-paced, melodic music combining sing-along choruses with intricate arrangements, three-part vocal harmonies, odd time signatures and literate, observational lyrics. 

They formed in 2003, their name being inspired by a budget compilation of Django Reinhardt & Stéphane Grappelli's Quinette du Hot Club de France. They signed to moshi moshi records in 2005, and released their debut album Drop It 'Til It Pops in October 2006, from which four singles were taken.

2006 and 07 were spent touring with Maxïmo Park, Jamie T, Dirty Pretty Things, Goodbooks, Slow Club, DARTZ! and Safetyword, and 2008 saw the arrival of their second album Live At Dead Lake, recorded in Chicago with producer Brian Deck.

Their latest releases are a pair of download and limited 10" EPs: With Days Like This As Cheap As Chewing Gum, Why Would Anyone Want To Work? (January 2010) and The Rise And Inevitable Fall Of The High School Suicide Cluster Band (May 2010), both supported by UK tours.
