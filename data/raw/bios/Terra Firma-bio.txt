2. Terra Firma (Australian)

Formed in 1994, Terra Firma have been carving their own style in the Australian Hip Hop scene since. With their own blend of multicultural sounds, poetic story lines and straight up party style beats, their music is being enjoyed and respected by all walks of life. After the release of their first album Waking the Past, Terra Firma quickly became an act to look out for, with Terra Firma being chosen to support some of the world's biggest hip hop acts. Terra Firma have also just finished performing five live shows with a six piece live band for the Adelaide Festival, in which they performed in front of 1000+ people per night, while also producing a new album on the sidelines. Terra Firma's live shows have become the trademark of the group and the crew always come through with an entertaining and value-for-money show even for people that are not into hip hop.
