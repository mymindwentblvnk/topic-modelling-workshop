Demilitia is a hybrid beast of thrash and death metal punctuated with an old school rock n' roll attitude.  Drawing influences from the likes of Cannibal Corpse, Slayer and Mastodon (to name a few) the band seeks to create an amalgam of their many diverse influences with results based primarily towards a crushing live performance.  Demilitia is all about raw energy and emotion, drawing creative influence more from their own desire for entertainment than by modern trends.

Demilitia originally formed in NYC in the summer/fall of 2006.  The band has seen members come and go through out the years, but has never ceased touring or recording new material.  They have played extensively throughout the Northeast and released their first, self-titled EP, in 2009.  In early 2010 original bassist Jayson Porsze left the group and was quickly replaced by Jenn Arroyo (formerly of Kittie and Suicide City).  The band jumped right back into the writing and recording process to produce a new 4 song EP to showcase the bands progression and growth.

The new EP, "At the Altar of the Earth," will be released on December 4th.

Demilitia is: Billy Maloney (guitar), Owen Burley (guitar), Chris O'Neil (drums), Hunter Reyes (vox) & Jenn Arroyo (bass)
