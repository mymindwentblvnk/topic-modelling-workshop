Forced Evolution  story started somewhere at the end of 2005 when leadguitarist Ulrich Schadeck decided to gather the pieces for a metalband. Those he was looking for were found with Nicolas Toussaint (Rhythm guitars), Schumyx (Bass) and Guillaume Pierson (Drums).

A first demo was released in 2006 and so was their first self produced EP : Unveiled later in 2007. Those 2 studio efforts allowed them to forge a good reputation by the quality of their material and to tour wherever and whenever it is possible, gaining some live experience, rocking out the fans with their riffs, beats and melodies.

Since then Forced Evolution arose in and out of their area as being a promising metalband, playing some kind of Melodic Death Metal, though that standard label would not be totally fitting into Forced Evolution original sound.

However as far as the position of singer was concerned the band was cursed and changed line-up twice in 2 years due to apparent but unexpected lack of motivation and personal stability of their previous singers. The band is still searching for a new frontman though they made a few shows with friend and singer Noemie Leer.

The band is currently working on their first album. A 3 song demo has just been recorded and will soon be released as a preview for that album.  With those refreshing tracks Forced Evolution hope they will manage to communicate their enthusiasm for their music and passion as well as to gain definitive recognition from professionals. More than ever the band is searching for professional partners (labels, bookers, managers...) in order to help them to promote their sound and vibes.

There used to be an other band called Forced Evolution. It was a Bigbeat/breakbeat band from the Netherlands that started in 1999.
