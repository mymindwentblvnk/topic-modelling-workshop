Alexander O'Neill, better known as ayokay, is a producer and electronic musician from Detroit, Michigan. Beginning his career collaborating with childhood friend Quinn XCII, the pair’s breakthrough came with the track “Kings of Summer”, which gained attention after its use as Texas Rangers outfielder Ian Desmond’s “walk-up” song. The success of the track earnt the pair a record deal with Columbia Records.

Whilst ayokay still produces a number of Quinn XCII tracks, he has begun to focus more on his own development as an artist. Following the release of his debut EP 4ft to Infinity, he has released a number of singles, featuring artists including Chelsea Cutler and Baker Grace. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/AyokAy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
