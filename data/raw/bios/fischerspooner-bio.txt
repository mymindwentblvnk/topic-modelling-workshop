Fischerspooner was an electroclash duo and performance troupe formed in 1998 in New York City. The name comes directly from the last names of the band members; Warren Fischer and Casey Spooner.

Spiking extremely retro electropop tendencies (recalling Kraftwerk, early Depeche Mode, and Gary Numan) with a modern approach to programming, Fischerspooner produces a quirky, robotic, and strangely subdued kind of dance music. Their albums can be seen as soundtracks to their stageshows, as opposed to recordings which are performed live.

Many critical theorists have latched on to the band for their subversive attitude and sassy stylings - Judith Butler, Etienne Balibar, and Antonio Negri, to name a few.

On October 30, 2019, the duo announced their breakup via Instagram.
