Engendered in 2001, Pseudosix is a Portland, OR-based collaborative project fronted by Tim Perry (guitar, vocals) and currently includes Kate O'Brien (violin, cello), Jake Morris (drums; also plays in Joggers), Jay Clarke (piano; The Standard, Dolorean), Dan Wilson (guitar; Joggers), and Brandon Barnhill (bass).

The band's well-received debut, Days of Delay, appeared on the 54ยบ 40' or Fight! label in 2003, when the band was only a trio comprising Perry, Emil Amos (Holy Sons, Grails) and drummer Joe Kelly (Leti Angel, ex-31 Knots). In August of 2007, the much-augmented Pseudosix released an eponymous full-length on Sonic Boom Records. Pseudosix reflects the greater number of musicians involved and Perry's growing confidence while still retaining the brooding Americana that made Days of Delay popular among both critics and listeners.
