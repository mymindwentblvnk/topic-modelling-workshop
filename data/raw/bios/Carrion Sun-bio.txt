Carrion Sun is a progressive thrash metal band from Houston Texas.

Starting in 2009, Carrion Sun formed and began caloborating to create the most brutal metal in The Woodlands/Houston area. Judson Duncan and Matthew Ballard began written for this project with the help of vocalist Matt Hughes and drummer Ryan Locke. They began playing shows without a bass player in hopes of finding one. At the beginning the songs would be writting on six string guitars, which helped create the raw thrash appeal of their sound. After hooking up with bass player Tyler Chapman, and replacing Ryan Locke with Steve Smith, Judson and Matt decided to take it to a different level and introduce seven string material. With a new drummer, and new strings, the sound has drastically changed for the better. Keep your eyes and ears pealed for an EP release coming in 2011.
