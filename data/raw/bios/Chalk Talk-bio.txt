With no music scene in their area to speak of, Chalk Talk has risen to the challenge of being a decidedly DIY band. Within months of forming, the band, then consisting of dual vocalists Bryce Pulaski and Andy Kapinos on guitar and drums respectively, recorded a six-song demo entitled 'Killing Spree', threw together a few dozen copies on their own and hit the road for a week-long Northeast tour.

Over the next year the band acquired a bassist, Brian Bartus, and worked on building up a fan base around their home in the suburbs of Enfield Connecticut and Western Massachusetts. They also recorded two songs for a split with The Black Churches called 'Penny On Heads'. Chalk Talk then hit the road for a self-booked, month-long tour, which took them across the Eastern half of the United States in support of their release 'The Food Chain'. The Food Chain, for which the band, in co-operation with Canadian label L'oeil Du Tigre, has made available on CD, 7", and cassette, get it they are rad

They currently live and practice in Amherst MA. An Ep is due to be released on a 12" vinyl in July 2012 under the name "Bad Influences". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chalk+Talk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
