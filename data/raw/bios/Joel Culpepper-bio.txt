JOEL CULPEPPER (pronounced KUHL-PEPPER)

In a time when the music industry is struggling to find itself and artists are taking fewer creative risks, among a fresh crop of emerging acts that are breaking the mould is Joel Culpepper.

South London based Joel Culpepper provides music listeners with an alternative sound, and his brand of Hip Hop – Soul infused music, is undeniably a breath of fresh air to the music industry.

In honing his craft on the live circuit for a number of years and impressing audiences and music critics alike with his distinctive sound and impassioned catalogue of songs, Joel Culpepper is set to become one of the industries most valued contributors of this generation.

His band, aptly named ‘The Transformers’, provide the musical backdrop for his shows. The talented band certainly live up to their name as each musician plays another instrument and changes over, or ‘transforms’, during his dynamic live sets.

In 2009, Joel Culpepper released his first Mixtape, ‘The Adventures of Pensmith’, which was well received, gaining the attention of UK Brand Box Fresh.

In February 2011 Joel Culpepper released his second Mixtape, ‘Joel Culpepper Meets J. Dilla’ which generated considerable interest among bloggers and music fans. This project, a tribute to the late great producer, showcased Joel Culpepper’s creativity, song writing skills, and quirky unique vocal style.

Joel has been working tirelessly on his upcoming debut EP (to be released on 1st October), which is set to demonstrate yet more of his versatility, as he champions individuality through music that is honest, real, and unforgettable. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joel+Culpepper">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
