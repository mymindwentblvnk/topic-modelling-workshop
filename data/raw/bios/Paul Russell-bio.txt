1. An artist signed to Kings Dream Entertainment and recently named a 2020 Rapzilla freshman, Paul Russell is an R&B inspired Christian Hip Hop artist. He's known for hits like Kalamazoo and Friends, as well as a collaboration album with Ruslan called Via Text. Known for his melodic style and gruff voice, Paul considers jazz fusion and Motown soul to be the genres from which he pulls many of his influences. He hopes to synthesize a variety of styles in his music to discuss topics such as faith, culture, and success.

2. Paul has meddled with dance music for the last 8 odd years and has experimented with many genres within the bounds of electronic music. Many tracks have been experimental and largely out of the box! What you hear here is a snapsot of his progress.
