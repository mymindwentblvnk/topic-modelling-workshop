Karma Rassa is a Russian band formed in 2013. They've released three albums thus far. They play a very atmospheric, emotionally tinged form of progressive metal. You can expect a warm soundscape with hypnotic singing and deep, almost tribal drumming. On their 2018 albums they even did all their lyrics in Russian. Can be compared to Anathema, Pain of Salvation, Riverside, etc. Influences include rock and metal, ethnic and folk, gothic and punk, ambient and electro music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Karma+Rassa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
