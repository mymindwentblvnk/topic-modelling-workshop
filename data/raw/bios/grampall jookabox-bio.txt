"I have no idea what you're trying to do, and that's either really good or really bad, I'm not sure." -- Jello Biafra on Grampall Jookabox

Experimental sound-collage explorations of genuine Americana songwriting, Grampall Jookabox write folk-esque ballads with mad scientist proficiency - in an end product which they dub "Jungle Folk." Grampall Jookabox is composed of David Adamson and Aimee Brown, filling each and every role in this sonically dense band. Instrumentation is as diverse as the influences, which range from Beastie Boys to Dead Kennedys, Animal Collective to Leadbelly.

The group's songwriter, David Adamson, has been influenced by distinctly diverse forms of music in his Indiana upbringing, ranging from Hip-Hop to Hardcore Punk, Indie to Midwestern Folk; each of which having their own place within Grampall Jookabox. Formerly, Adamson fronted the jammy rock collective BIGBIGcar, whose debut album, released by Standard Recording Company, received praise from songwriter enthusiasts and experimental rockers alike.

The duo of Grampall Jookabox emerged with the explicit goal of creating their own "anthology" of American Folk music, focusing on the strange, dark, and morbid characteristics of turn-of-the-century sounds. The end product ends up sounding like a bizarrely advanced Brian Wilson-from-the-future paying homage to Robert Johnson.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grampall+Jookabox">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
