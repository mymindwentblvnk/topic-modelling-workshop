The band name, TAGHUT, was taken only after the album was recorded. It is an Islamic word:

"In an Islamic context, the Arabic word taghut refers to idolatry, considered impurity. This can be anything worshipped other than the one true God (Allah), such as deities of other religions, people claiming themselves to be holy outside of Islam's definition, or the worshipping of ideas or ideologies before God." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Taghut">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
