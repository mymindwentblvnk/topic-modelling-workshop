There are multiple bands with this name.

1. A Japanese visual kei band. Light & Shade formed in 1990. After releasing a few demos, the group released its only album, "Trial Product", in 1991. The album sold decently among the early visual audience, and Light & Shade continued to tour throughout the year. In March of 1992, the group appeared on the "Emergency Express 1992 ~Surging the Next Crisis~" omnibus, and the group released a few more demos throughout the rest of the year. However, Light & Shade disbanded by early 1993. None of the bandmates were known to join another band, and it can be presumed that all of the members retired from the visual scene after Light & Shade's disbandment.
