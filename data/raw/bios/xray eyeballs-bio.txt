XRay Eyeballs is OJ and Carly (from NYC rockers Golden Triangle) new drum machine driven dark punk project. Bathed in reverb, low fi sheen, and weirdo grit, XRay Eyeballs sounds like two drifter kids covered in makeup and glitter trying to escape a dead city skyline proclaiming their love for each other as the world just passes them by. Creeped out and charming all at once. If the world died but the songs kept playing." - SDREED, Night-People Records
