Tony Clarke (died 1970) was an American soul singer-songwriter born in New York City and raised in Detroit. He wrote the songs Pushover and Two Sides to Every Story, hits for Etta James. 

Clarke scored a chart hit of his own with The Entertainer which hit #10 R&B and #31 Pop in the US in 1965. Clarke died in 1970, too late to see his career see a resurgence in the 1970s on the UK northern soul scene. The intense devotion was given to an obscure Chess single, Landslide, and a song recorded later in Detroit on MS called (They Call Me) A Wrong Man.

Clarke also had a minor role in the Sidney Poitier film They Call Me MISTER TIBBS! in 1970. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Clarke">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
