Sports Coach grew out of a purple paste-like substance that was launched into deep-space by NASA in 1983. Once Sports Coach had grown to a reasonable size of 7 foot 11 inches he swam through space back to Earth where he took up residence in Ventura, California. When not coaching his team of off-road pickup truck drivers, Sports Coach loves to "cool-out", "kick-back", and "ride-the-wave" with fellow residents at his retirement home. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SpORTS+COACH">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
