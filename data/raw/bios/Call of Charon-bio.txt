CALL OF CHARON, founded in 2006, is a deathcore band from Duisburg (NRW), Germany.

In 2005 guitar player Philipp Kaase and bass player Jan Wiesten converged in the collaborative project “The Glasshouse Therapy”. After being joined by vocalist Patrick Kluge (ex-Bleeding Heaven, ex-Hopelezz (live), ex-Dypressive), several changes in line-up, self-concept and genre alignment made the former name obsolete.

Revitalizing bandspirit and ambition, the band named itself “Call of Charon” refering to oarsmen of greek and roman mythology. Charon was chosen as appropriate because of his relentlessness and the tragic role as a mere messenger of death as well as for being a representative of judgement day’s trial, which again plays a role in human self-understanding.

From this moment on the band worked straight onward, renewing setlist and started recording of their first EP “Shot.Dead.Drowing” in 2007’s autumn. After finishing their EP, CoC played their first shows in clubs and youth centres in vicinity of their hometowns.

In 2008’s spring, Call of Charon started their “Dates in Desperation”-Tour, playing ten shows throughout Nordrhein-Westphalen, being enforced by former “Dypressive” member Moritz Güdde from this time on. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Call+of+Charon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
