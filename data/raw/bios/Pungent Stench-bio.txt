Pungent Stench was an Austrian three-piece death metal band, formed in 1988 in Vienna. Staring off with the 1988 demo Mucous Secretion, they gained considerable notoriety in the early to mid-90s due to their explicit lyrics and offensive cover artwork, which saw their releases banned in numerous countries worldwide. They dissolved temporarily from 1995 but reformed in 1999, recording two new albums in 2001 and 2004.

The band disbanded after sporadic touring in the mid-00s, with an album recorded in 2007 remaining unreleased and 2004s Ampeauty being their last official work. However, an alternative version of the band was reactivated by Martin Schirenc in August 2013, using the name the Church of Pungent Stench for live shows to avoid legal trouble. In 2014 he had to change the band name to Schirenc plays Pungent Stench. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pungent+Stench">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
