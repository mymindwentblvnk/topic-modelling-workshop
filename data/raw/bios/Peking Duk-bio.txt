Earlier this year, there came to be two nocturnal creatures who loved nightlife. However, this love had to go further, the two desired a relationship with the nightlife’s fuel and energy. As the craving increased, turntables and production software were bought. And so it began . . . .

Since then, the duo have warmed up the stage for DJ Falcon, DCUP, Trevor Loveys, Worthy, Justin Martin, Ehsan Gelsi, Paqman, Dahahu, Raw City Rukus, Shifty Business, Offtapia, Cheese, Hubert and many more. In this brief yet colourful timeframe, they’ve even had a mixtape featured on world-renowned art/music/street culture website ‘killahbeez.com’.

The duK love creating unique sounds, mixing obscure genres, and laying a heavy bass over anything. Their versatility with styles and enthusiastic open minds hold a bright future for these new kids on the block.
