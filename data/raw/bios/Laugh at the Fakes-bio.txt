Drawing influences from classic rock to thrash metal, Laugh At The Fakes is a hard rock band that pushes the limits of the genre while staying true to it. Formed in the fall of 2010, Laugh At The Fakes is the brainchild of singer/guitarist and songwriter Everett Mason. The high energy quartet which features Everett Mason on vocals and guitar, Julian Craig on drums, Galen Weir on bass, and Erik Moody on guitar, have just released their debut record “One Night Only” which is available on iTunes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Laugh+At+the+Fakes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
