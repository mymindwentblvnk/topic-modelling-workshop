Sea Oleena is the project of Canadian musician Charlotte Oleena. Based out of Montreal, her music hovers between ambient dream pop and experimental post-folk, relying on rich, atmospheric textures, subtle guitar effects, and a sort of autumnal melancholia. Aided by her brother Luke Loseth, she released a self-titled mini album in 2010 followed a year later by a second mini album called Sleeplessness. With her crystalline voice and atmospheric tones, Oleena's music has been compared to acts like Grouper and Julianna Barwick, though in her more structured moments there are echoes of dream pop pioneers the Cocteau Twins and a kitsch-less Julee Cruise. For her third release and first proper LP, she signed with Oregon-based indie Lefse Records. Her label debut Shallow arrived in September 2014.
