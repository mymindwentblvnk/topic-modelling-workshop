Shortie No Mass (born Terressa Thompson) is an African-American RnB singer/rapper from Philadelphia. She was discovered by De La Soul and heavily featured on their third album, 1993's Buhloone Mindstate. She travelled with them around the world and gained experience in the music industry. Violator Records' Chris Lighty offered her a signing, but the venture never worked out. Shortie No Mass has seldom been heard from since 1993, but she has remained active, working with DJ Premier, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Da Beatminerz, and Rockwilder. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shortie+No+Mass">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
