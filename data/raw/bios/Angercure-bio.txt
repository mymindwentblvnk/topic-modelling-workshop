Angercure started its life as a band in 1992. The band name then was "Graveworm".
After an year of setting up the band crew, jamming around and covering permanently The Exploited, the core of the band formed around Hristo Petrov /drums/, Nikolay Gech–µvski /ex-vocals & rhythm guitars/ and Viktor Mihaylov /lead guitar/. Bass parts were played by many musicians, incl. the ex-Enthrallment & today's Angercure guitarist Chris Hristov.
In the years 1996-1997 Zhivko Lazarov joined the band as a full time bass player.
In 1996 Angercure, operating under the name "Graveworm", released the demo album "Remembrance Is Pain".
In the next couple of years the band recorded four more demo tracks and called it quits for various reasons.
The year 2009 is the year of the return of Angercure. With new name, new vision and new musical direction.
