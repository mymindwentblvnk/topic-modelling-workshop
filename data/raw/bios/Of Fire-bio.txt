"Of fire is a death metal band from Sweden. They play "heavy as shit" death metal/death n roll with a raw attitude.
The music is relativly simple and to the point, Good riffs always being the main focus.
Words like "feeling" and "energy" being far more important than "technical" and "fast". A genuin sound moulded from five childhood friends including the Thunell brothers and playing metal since they forged their identity around 14 years old. They are hear to point the middle finger to it all!"
OF FIRE was discovered by Tomas Skogsberg, he believed in the band and took them under his wings in the fall of 2012 and recorded their debut album "Carnage fever" Now with lots of local and national gigs, two festival gigs and a european tour later they're back in Sunlight studio recording their second album "Death do us all" wich is planned to be released in 2016 they're hiting the road once again to promote the new album and to bring the metal world on it's knees and start over where it all went wrong.
