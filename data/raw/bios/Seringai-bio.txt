Early 2002, Jakarta, Indonesia. After a year disbanding his legendary hardcore outfit for 10 years, vocalist Arian13 [Puppen, Aparatmati] and old time friends, drummer Kemod [from Bandung thrash grinders, Aparatmati] and guitarist Ricky [from Jakarta's finest hardcore band, Stepforward] founded SERINGAI ['grin' in Indonesian]. Fueled by a desire to play a blend between Motorhead, Black Sabbath, hard rock & metal influences, they began to jam together after bassist Toan joined. SERINGAI was already in the habit of constantly writing songs, and playing small gigs in Jakarta and Bandung. Anthem songs like Alkohol [Alcohol] and Membakar Jakarta [Burning Jakarta], are the crowd's favorites. SERINGAI became more popular and the shows were beer-soaked and the sing along, slamdancing, stagediving never stops. 

Shortly thereafter, Toan left the band, and was replaced by Sammy. The band recorded 9 songs including a cover of Black Flag's Jealous Again, and released High Octane Rock EP in 2004 in tape format on their own label, Parau. Many shows in support of the tape, and without proper promotion they have sold about 12.000 copies of High Octane Rock EP. They even got offered to write songs for local movie soundtrack, teenage flick Catatan Akhir Sekolah and horror flick 12:00 AM. Their fanbase grows bigger, and named themselves 'Serigala Militia' or, Seringai's wolfpack. In 2005, the CD version is released. Fortunately, the CD version was highly anticipated, and with different and exclusive artwork, it has sold 2000 copies in just 2 month. This time, the CD was distributed by Off The Records/Universal Music Indonesia.
