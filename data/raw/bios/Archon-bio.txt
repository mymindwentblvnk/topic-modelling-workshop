3. Archon was formed in 1996-97 by Lars Archon from the ashes of Vidder which contained musicians such as Mustis (Dimmu Borgir), Sjonkel (eks.Tsjuder) and Elvorn (Susperia). Archon has been the main priority of Lars Archon since then with some short stops in other bands such as Enslavement of beauty, Dimmu Borgir, Nocturnal Breed and Tsjuder. Archon was originally intended to be a solo project but after sharing ideas with Ole Alexander Myrholt (Enslavement of Beauty, Diabolical Breed, The Whipcords) it became a full time band. Per Valla (Allfader, Elite) joined Archon as a second guitarist. Andreas Paulsen (Dead Trooper, Left Among the Living) was included on bass and finally the seventeen years old Are Sorknes (Dead Trooper) on drums. Are did a excellent job in rehearsing and recording all of the material on extremely short notice and has been an important part of Archons very first recording as a band. The Birthmachine promo was recorded in Ares basement the summer of 2004, mixed by Lars Archon and Are Sorknes and mastered by Tom Kvålsvoll at Strype Studios September the same year. Tom is known as Thrawn in bands like Nocturnal Breed and Dødheimsgard. Archon draws inspiration from bands like At the Gates, Carcass and Queensryche etc and can be described as a melodic blend of thrash and death metal.
