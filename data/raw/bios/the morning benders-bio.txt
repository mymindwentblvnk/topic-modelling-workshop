On March 25, 2012, The Morning Benders changed their name to POP ETC.

The Morning Benders is a band from Berkeley, California, formed in 2005, consisting of Julian Harmon, Tim Or, Jonathan Chu, and Christopher Chu. In 2008, they released their debut album Talking Through Tin Cans on +1 Records. The band has toured in support of Broken Bells (Spring/Summer 2010), Grizzly Bear (Fall 2009), The Kooks and Death Cab for Cutie (Summer 2008), Ra Ra Riot (Fall 2008), The Black Keys (Summer 2010), and has also played with Yo La Tengo, MGMT, Grand Archives, Yeasayer, Two Gallants, The Rosebuds, Au Revoir Simone, We Are Scientists, and White Rabbits. They also toured with The Submarines in 2009. Having shared the stage with other bands such as Beach House, MGMT, Ra Ra Riot, Grizzly Bear and Girls, these boys are seasoned vets. Donâ€™t let their age deceive you. 
In December 2008, iTunes deemed Talking Through Tin Cans the best indie/alternative album of 2008.

The Morning Benders recorded their 2010 album Big Echo in San Francisco and mixed it in Brookyln. Chris Chu and Chris Taylor (Grizzly Bear) produced it in eleven days. On the twelfth day they rejoiced. There are 10 tracks on Big Echo, which The Morning Benders think is an ideal length for an album. 

In March of 2012 the band announced that they would be changing their name to POP ETC. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Morning+Benders">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
