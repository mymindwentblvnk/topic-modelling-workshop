Margin of Existence was formed by Alex Bondroit(Guitars) and George Triantafilou(Vocals) in the summer of 2006 in Thesaloniki,Greece. They started to work on some songs of their own,trying to combine aggression and melody, to bring out their own sound, influenced by swedish melodic death metal bands such as At the Gates, In Flames, The Haunted, Nightrage and generally by the metal scene. Former band members were John Sidos(Guitars),George Biros(Bass),Agelos Tsiboukelis(Guitars) and George Arvanitidis(Guitars).

From there on the band continued to perform live in Greece.Late 2009 marks the completion of the first (full lenght) album entitled "The Road to Despair".
