Melbourne two-piece Super Wild Horses met in an all girls catholic school in the summer of '96. It took them twelve years to form a band. Homemade songs about blood, ghosts and golden arrows are beaten up by messy rhythms and schoolyard yells. 

SOLD OUT - Debut 7" vinyl EP on Aarght! Records released March 2009.
