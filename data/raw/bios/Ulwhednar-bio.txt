Ulwhednar is the recording project of Northern Electronics label founders Jonas Rönnberg (aka Varg) and Anthony Linell (better known as Abdulla Rashim). Bringing together a mix of ice-cold noise, motorik techno, and power electronics, the duo delivered their first release, the limited cassette Withatten 1892, in September 2013, and swiftly followed the cassette with a vinyl edition, simply titled LP, the next month. With both releases arriving on their burgeoning label, the duo acted quickly to issue Midvinter in December, once again on limited cassette. The duo's next release, 1520, followed a year later, and with the odd live performance, Ulwhednar's releases slowed as Rönnberg focused on his own work and Linell also became an in-demand DJ and live performer with his Abdulla Rashim project. The duo returned at the beginning of 2016 with the limited cassette release Om Syndernas Förlåtelse before issuing the follow-up, 2017's Modern Silver, which also featured guest vocals for the first time from Posh Isolation founder Loke Rahbek.
