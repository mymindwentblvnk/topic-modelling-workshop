Groove, punch, heavy riffs & melody define Broken & Burnt, a band that started in 2011 in Vitória, Espírito Santo, Brazil. 

In October 2011 the demo "Hate Will Grow" was released and due to positive feedback from the public, the band started playing local Gigs supporting it. 

Recently the band released its debut album called ''Let the Burning Begin''. It's a 9 track record filled with powerful riffs and agressive lyrics around alcohol & hate. In October 2012, the band released the Video for "The New Me" exploring some live footage. 

Although B&B is a new band, they opened concerts for bands like Macaco Bong, Viper and Zumbis do Espaço. Right now the band is playing as many shows as possible to support "Let The Burning Begin".
