It may also be an incorrect artist tag for the soundtrack to a series of fighting games. The famous "Mortal Kombat Theme" is called "Techno Syndrome" and is produced by The Immortals. Please do yourself and Last.fm a favour and  fix your tags by putting the actual artist name in the artist field. The easiest way is to use MusicBrainz Picard.
