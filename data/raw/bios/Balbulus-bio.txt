"...somewhere between Industrial, Metal, Ambient, and Punk", balbulus formed in Kent (UK) in 2004. Duality and paradox are recurrent themes of the balbulus universe. Aspects of traditional culture are juxtaposed with elements of post-modern abstraction. Modern digital technology is coupled with deliberately basic recording and gigging setups.
