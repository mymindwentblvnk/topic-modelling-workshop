Biography:
Veiled in Scarlet is a Melodic Death Metal band, with huge Neo-Classical influences, and is the true spiritual successor of SERPENT. They're formed in 2010 in Kobe, Japan, two years after Keija put his older band SERPENT on ice.
It's Keija's (Ex. Serpent drummer) and Hiroki's (Ex. Serpent Guitarist) new band/project after leaving Serpent, and they play almost in the same style as Serpent did/does.
For the album 'IDEALISM' Aki (Ex. Serpent Guitarist) helped out with guitar-recordings on some of the tracks too. Also, many of the unreleased songs that should have been released on Serpent's 3rd album were instead remade/remastered and released on Veiled in Scarlet's debut album "IDEALISM".
In 2012, after the album release, vocalist 'Shun' departed from the band and Kubota Dogen, AFTERZERO's vocalist, took his place. Also the bassist Hiro (from SERPENT) helps Keija with Veiled in Scarlet's live-performances as a bass player, as Veiled in Scarlet's lineup lacks a bassist.
