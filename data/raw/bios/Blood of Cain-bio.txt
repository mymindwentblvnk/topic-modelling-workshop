Brutally Honest American Dead Metal based out of Chico, CA.  Blood of Cain was formed in at the end of 2005 by members of Northern California Metal Bands Fallon, Brain in a Cage, and Bloodwork.

The original lineup consisted of Ken Bedene, Jake Costello, Cory Vespra, Kirk Williams, and Frank Bedene.
Within a short period of time the band released an independent demo and began tour up and down the west coast opening for bands such as The Faceless, High on Fire, Finntroll, and Warbringer.

Williams and Vespra left Blood of Cain at the beginning of 2008.  Guitarist Matt Fuller and bassist Scott Moyer replaced the original members and are still working with the band.

Blood of Cain is currently writing and recording material for an up-coming release scheduled for early 2010.

Member Ken Bedene is currently, "on tour," playing drums for Abigail Williams.
