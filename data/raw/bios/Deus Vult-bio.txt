3)If you lived in or around the New Orleans scene in the early 1980’s the name DEUS VULT should be very familiar to you. The band played all over the place and were the breeding ground for some great players that would move on to other bands after the band broke up. The members included Matt Thomas on guitar who would later join S.S. STEEL, then RAZOR WHITE (which featured New Orleans veteran vocalist Phil Anselmo) then eventually he went on to join CROWBAR in the early 1990’s and become a music producer for DOWN and FALL FROM GRACE before he got married and moved to Oklahoma. Steve Joseph was their drummer, who would follow Matt into RAZOR WHITE, who would eventually become a road manager and a pyro guy for a handful of national acts as well as run the local haunted house The House Of Shock. Second guitarist Gary Wilson who was doing guitar squeals well over a decade before they became famous by Zakk Wild, would later surface in one of the incarnations of DARK AUGUST during the late 1980’s and early 1990’s before disappearing himself. Bill Wolfe was their singer, I haven’t seen him since…The band also featured Glenn Montecino, the statuesque bassist of these local heavy metal legends. Glenn and I have maintained contact with each other over the years and still remain friends. Glenn lives in North Louisiana and works for a law firm. This is a tribute to a great heavy metal band that use to play the club circuit here in Louisiana in the early and mid 1980’s. Those times are missed and will never be forgotten. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DEUS+VULT">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
