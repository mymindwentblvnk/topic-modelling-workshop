Afrobomination are an afro crust/black Metal band. They are black as the night. Their afros are quite large, and they are a threat to NASA's being & operations (Cause they are fucking SPACE motherfuckers!) and because of this, NASA rips off Afrobomination's work, releasing it under the NASA banner.

Early 1783 (in Earth years), Afromancer and Set_Afrobominae met on Jupiter and decided to start a band. Wyll Smyth ascended the ranks of space in this instant, and began playing drums on crashed meteorites & space junk. After a Jupiter smoke session, they decided on playing a mix of doom, death metal & crust punk...the original Afrobomination - in their own words: "Afro Crust" -  in the vein of Sleep, Electric Wizard, Discharge, Coffins, Hellbastard and Killing Joke.  In June 2012, Afrobomination made their presence known on Earth by playing a live set during the Transit of Venus, where the first issue of "Space Motherfuckers" was released, which contained 5 songs - [song]I'm Black[/song], [song]Afro of Death[/song], [song]Iron Claw (The Pimp Hand)[/song], [song]You're Whack[/song], and [song]Smoke Space Everyday[/song] - condensed under less than 15 minutes.

Afrobomination are currently working on their new album, the name of which remains unknown.

They are better than both Baconator and Buttgoroth combined.
