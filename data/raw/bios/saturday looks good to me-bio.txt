Saturday Looks Good to Me is an indie pop band from Ann Arbor, Michigan that formed in 1999. The group is led by singer-songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Fred Thomas (former member of His Name Is Alive).

They are based in Ann Arbor and Detroit.  Through Thomas, the group's major songwriter, the group creates intricate soundscapes which harken back to Detroit soul, such as Motown, as well as some of the better recordings by The Beach Boys and productions of Phil Spector.

The band went on temporary hiatus in 2008, only to reappear in 2012 joined by new vocalist Carol Gray.  They released an album One Kiss Ends It All in 2013, with all songs penned by Fred Thomas. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Saturday+Looks+Good+To+Me">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
