Thorned Crown is a 2-man black metal project from Noord-Holland, the Netherlands.
It started out as a highschool band called 'Fangs of Rage', formed by Bart (guitar), Wouter (vocals), Randy (guitar) and Steffan (bass). This never worked out though, and Bart and Steffan continued to create the death metal outfit 'Gift of Death', later to be changed to 'Thorned Crown'. With a new direction and name, the plan was to start a furocious new project, but due to Steffans arrogance and lack of time/direction it never worked out, and Thorned Crown recruited Meister Luge (Daan) as a guitarist. Later on drummer/vocalist Grymm M. (Joey H.) was recruited. After a while Meister Luge decided to stop playing though, leaving the band with only a guitarist and drummer. Again, a loss because of lack of direction. 
A couple of months and rehearsals later, Thorned Crown recorded the single 'The Blasphemic Curse', which was never released. Some other songs were also recorded, but due to other needs besides the band, it was put on hold.
Then, after a long silence, the Crown has awoken once more. The Blasphemic Curse was re-recorded, with improved audio quality and a different style. Once again Thorned Crown returns, better but also rawer and more ferocious than ever. Their goal? Destruction. Ending the Christian lunacy. And, while doing that, we give a big HAIL to the almighty QUORTHON of BATHORY. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thorned+Crown">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
