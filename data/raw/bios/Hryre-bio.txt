Hryre is a Black Metal project based in West Yorkshire, England, formed in 2014. Hryre's musical focus directed towards ancient heritage, individualism and spirituality. Our lyrics reflect those of self-exploration and our own spiritual growth. We construct music of a darker and atmospheric reflection in an attempt to harness the ambiance of the landscapes of our beautifully bleak surroundings whilst focusing on subject matters in which challenge and provoke thought.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hryre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
