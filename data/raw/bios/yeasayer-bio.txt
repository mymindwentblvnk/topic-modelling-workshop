Yeasayer was a band based in Brooklyn, New York. The band was formed in 2006 and consisted of three core members, Chris Keating, Ira Wolf Tuton, and Anand Wilder. They first came to attention after appearing at the SXSW festival in early 2007. Their debut album All Hour Cymbals was released in October 2007. Yeasayer described their music as "Middle Eastern-psych-snap-gospel". Live performances often include psychedelic visuals.

Yeasayer released their second studio album, Odd Blood, in February 2010, featuring more pop music influences than earlier work. The band revealed that the album came out of a massive acid trip in New Zealand. Peter Gabrielâ€™s drummer Jerry Marotta helped to record Odd Blood in an upstate New York studio packed with rare synths and percussion instruments from around the globe to create the characteristic worldbeat sound of the album.

Yeasayer released their third studio album, Fragrant World, in August 2012. According to the Fingers Never Bleed Songfacts, it was named after a track that didn't make the new album's final cut.

Yeasayer officially announced its dissolution on December 19, 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yeasayer">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
