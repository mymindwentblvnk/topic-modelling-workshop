Armazilla is a stoner metal power trio from Atlanta,Georgia that started in 2002.They started touring almost immediately slowly growing as a live band rather than hiding in a rehearsal studio somewhere.
These guys have a classic sound that reminds you of that 1979-83 period of metal when everything was about denim,volume,and smoke.
They have one s/t EP which moved quickly around the underground circuits.
They've appeared on numerous compilations and have a full-length "Texxasweed" slated to come out in 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Armazilla">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
