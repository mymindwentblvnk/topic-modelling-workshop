Downstroy was formed in 2004. We recorded our first demo during the same year and it was named “0051". While recording in a studio, we were also quite busy doing concerts in many places (Belgrade, Novi Sad, Banja Luka (BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA), Skopje (MACEDONIA), Timisoara, Arad (ROMANIA), Kikinda, Sombor, Becej, Novi Becej, Zrenjanin, Pancevo, Senta, Mol, Backa Topola…), where we performed with already well-known bands such as: SUBSCRIBE, BLIND MYSELF, !NSULT, EYESBURN, RITAM NEREDA, CADAVERES, DRONE, OVERDRIVE, DRACONIC, AMON DIN, YOBO etc. Also, we performed at many well-knows festivals (EXIT, Refuse/Resist, Gramofonija...). In the end of 2006, our debut EP “I SCREAM EVERY DAY” was recorded, where Nikola Mijic contributed to this album, and helped us to record it and mix it. We also had several guests on this album like: Nemanja Kojic Coyote (EYESBURN), Marjan Mijic (ex-DRACONIC) and Nikola Mijic (ALOGIA/DREYELANDS). In the year of 2007 (our biggest success up to now) Downstroy won Metal Battle contest, and as the first band in history of former Yugoslav Republics, they went to perform on a world largest heavy metal festival WACKEN OPEN AIR in GERMANY. The music we play, we like to call it modern metal altogether combined with metal-core rhythms and melodically choruses… Downstroy has a video for a song called “YOUR GAME”. New album "ONE SIZE FITS ALL" is released in 2010 through the online label SMP Music and it's available for free download. Recorded in CHAINROOM studio (Senta, Serbia) by Nikola Mijic with special guests appearances by Chvare (OVERDRIVE) and Marjan Mijic (TIARAH).
