Taking cues from late '70s/early '80s synthpunk pioneers as THE SCREAMERS, NERVOUS GENDER and THE UNITS, this Arizona-based one man band rely on just keyboards, drum machines and vocals to set the scene of gloomy electronic desert landscapes and gay night club discotheques. This is the life of Shawn Foree, who created this in his one bedroom apartment in Tempe, Arizona. Live, he borrows members from THE WONGS, REATARDS, LOST SOUNDS and DESTRUCTION UNIT. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Digital+Leather">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
