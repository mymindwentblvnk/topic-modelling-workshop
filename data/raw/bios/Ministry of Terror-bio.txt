The band was founded in 1994 on the ashes of BYOB (founded in 1990), a thrash metal band in which Hans Mertens, Elzo Nijboer and Remco Hulst played. In 1995 they played on tour in Europe along with Impaled Nazarene and Krabathor. But the same year, Hans Mertens left the band and Remco Hulst took vocals. In 1996 they played on the X-TREM Tour with Threnody and Creemine. In 1997, Henri Sattler (God Dethroned) left and was replaced by Vince Zwarts and in 1998 Elzo Nijboer and Tjerk De Boer also left, thus the band split-up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ministry+of+Terror">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
