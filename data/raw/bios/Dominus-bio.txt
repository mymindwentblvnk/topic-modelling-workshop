Dominus is a Danish Death metal band  formed in Ringsted. They released four albums First one (View to the dim) in 1994, and the last (Godfallos) in 2000. Their style developed from pure Death Metal on their first two albums, into a more rock and roll sound on their latest. A style which frontman Michael Poulsen developed further in his new band Volbeat (which also is the name of the 1997 dominus album).
