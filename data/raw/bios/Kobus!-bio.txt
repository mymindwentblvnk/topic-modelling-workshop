Kobus! (or K.O.B.U.S!) is an Afrikaans extreme metal band formed in 2000 by ex-Springbok Nude Girls guitarist Theo Crous and ex-Voice of Destruction vocalist Francois Breytenbach Blom. They performed as a duo until 2004 when they were joined by Rob Nel on bass and Paul Andr√© Blom on drums.

In 2007 Rob Nel was replaced on bass by Pierre Tredoux and in 2008 drummer Paul Andre Blom was replaced by Werner Von Waltsleben.

The band has released three albums: The self-titled debut  Kobus! in 2002, 100% Skuldgevoelvry in 2004, and  SwaarMetaal in 2007. The first two releases contained an eclectic mix of styles, crossing genres from track to track. The album Swaar Metaal, which won the 'Best Afrikaans Rock Album' award at the 2008 South African Music Awards, is sonically more uniform than its predecessors, an Afrikaans-language heavy metal album, regarded as a first in Afrikaans music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kobus%21">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
