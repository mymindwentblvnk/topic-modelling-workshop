Christoffer Berg was born and raised by two musicians in Gothenburg, Sweden. Growing up in a musical environment made it possible for Christoffer to play around with music from the early days of childhood, which might explain his relaxed attitude towards creating music. Christoffer "Hird" Berg does everything himself: drums, percussion, keyboards, guitar and vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hird">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
