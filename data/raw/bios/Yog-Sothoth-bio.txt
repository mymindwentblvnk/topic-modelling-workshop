Yog-Sothoth is a band from Minnesota.

Yog-Sothoth is Ben Zientara and Cory Strand.  These men have been members of other bands like The Kafka Dreams, Tarrasque, and Dreamless.

Yog-Sothoth's music is inspired by the music of Skullflower, 5ive, The Melvins, Bardo Pond, and Metal music in general.

Yog-Sothoth have recorded three full albums, including a double album.  

-Hypnotic Crushery, the first album, represents the early work by the duo.  The album features 6 long, trancelike pieces, each featuring one or two heavy riffs, bombastic, Dale Crover-inspired drum beats, and overdubbed bass, guitar solos, and noise.  The album was recorded in Minneapolis, MN, by Adam Lazlo Rutkowski, in 2004, and was released on the Yith Recordings bandcamp website in April, 2010.

-Extraordinarily Magickal, the double album from Yog-Sothoth, was recorded in January of 2006.  Adam Lazlo Rutkowski again handled the task of capturing the magick, and the three-day, 30-hour session was a bruiser for all involved.  Extraordinarily Magickal sees Yog-Sothoth expanding their oeuvre to include vocals, more melodic songs based on tones and polyphony instead of riffs and solos, and generally taking everything the project had been up to that point to its logical next step.  Longer, louder, more involved; this album is a monument to the band's ability to use improvisation to heighten the effects of the trance-inducing monotony of their songs' structures.  This album has seen no form of official release.  The finished product will, likely as not, contain 14 tracks, totaling 2.1 hours.

-Yog III (working title) was recorded, again by Adam Lazlo Rutkowski, in November of 2006.  It comprises 3 tracks, totalling 45 minutes.  Again, the band refines and heightens its approach to music.  The songs are longer, heavier, and even more blissed-out and dense than ever before.

Various other one-off tracks, demos, and live recordings exist.
