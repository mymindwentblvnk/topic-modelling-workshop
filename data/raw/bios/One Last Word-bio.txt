ONE LAST WORD was formed in Madrid in 2002 with the idea of combining their classical heavy metal influences with an actual hardcore style. During the first three years the band went through various line-up changes which ended up stabilizing with the arrival of the vocalist Fabo (ex TODAY ENDS DYING) and drummer Dani (ex VERSUS, NACEN DE LAS CENIZAS), with whom they played their debut gigs in Mutalfest and in the Metalcore One Day Fest. 

At the end of 2005 the bands definitive line-up would be finalized with the arrival of guitarrist Javi and Chus (HYBRID, ex ANOTHER KIND OF DEATH, ex JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, ex COILBOX) on the drums. ONE LAST WORD, with new compositions, would return to giving concerts alongside bands such as CONFRONTO, NO TURNING BACK, BLACK CLOUD HALO, NONE SHALL BE SAVED, STILLRISE, THE PHOENIX, ATSPHEAR,THE BAND APART and SOUND OF SILENCE. The band´s style has evolved its metal and hardcore combo incorporating an elaborate guitar style which combines technique, melody and aggressiveness, backed up by the talent of the new drummer. 

In June 2006, for the first time they would enter the studio to record 4 tracks with producer Tito Saavedra in Ritmo Y Compas studios. By November, they had edited their first EP “No More Second Chances” with the idea of making their music available to a wider public and to find a label which could edit their future LP. Actually the band continues playing concerts while they finish composing the tracks that will be included in their first full length record, which they will start recording in Spring of 2007 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/One+Last+Word">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
