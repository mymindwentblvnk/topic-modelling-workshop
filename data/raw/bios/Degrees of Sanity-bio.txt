Degrees of Sanity formed as Edge of Dawn in late 2000 from the remains of the band Symmetry. Scott Butler and Matt Kampman came from the remains of Symmetry and brothers Sean and Brandon Daniels came form the remains of Origin Unknown. The interesting chemistry worked immediately and the band quickly started rocking the Denver scene. They have been featured on the Colorado Rock TV Show 3 times as well as The Cone Zone.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Degrees+of+Sanity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
