AKHENATEN is a Manitou Springs, CO-based Middle Eastern black/ death metal project created in 2012 by the Houseman brothers as a side hobby to their full-time band Helleborus. With all music arranged by Jerred and vocals done by his brother Wyatt.
The music expresses the Ancient Mesopotamian themes/ alien theories exploring the forgotten paths of history, extracting unknown lore and threads of truth. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Akhenaten">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
