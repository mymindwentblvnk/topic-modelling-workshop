Described as “a sultry mix between classical stylings and pop” (NEST HQ), MOONZz thrives balancing the past and present. She is influenced by dark, cinematic orchestrations of the classical baroque era, and remains a student of iconic predecessors such as Elliot Smith, Air, Death Cab for Cutie, and Daedalus. These disparate styles create genuine, atypical music:­ fresh, raw and still reminiscent of mixes from her youth. Only 25 years old, MOONZz has a wealth of experience having released independently, under Atlantic’s subsidiary label Taste And Tone and alongside her fellow producer peers as a collaborator and featured artist. Like the luminous moon above, MOONZz rises with an effervescent magnetism. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MOONZZ">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
