Discipline X`s music is a combination of old school punk rock and thrash metal. They play fast and straight and there is a lot of energy in their songs but sometimes there are slower heavy metal parts included. Someone said that they "sound like a fast punk rock band playing with Metallica sound".

They come from Western Finland and there are three members in this band. The band has played in this form from 2010.

They adore bands like Misfits, D.R.I, The Exploited, Suicidal Tendencies, Mot√∂rhead, S.O.D, Dead Kennedys and many more - try to figure it out by yourself. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Discipline+X">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
