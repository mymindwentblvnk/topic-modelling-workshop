Serotonal is a band created in 2004 by former Anathema Vocalist Darren White, Jon Francis-White and Gary Hill.

At the end of 2004, Francis-White, Hill and White got together to try out some of their ideas, and in 2004 they recorded their first few tracks. The promo is suitably entitled, The End of Everything, which is currently available on line via iTunes. In 2005, along with new drummer Simon Monkhouse, Serotonal recorded and released the EP The Futility of Trying to Avoid the Unavoidable, which has since been re-released through Metal Breath Production from August 2007, developing much interest and attention in Europe. 

Serotonal were joined by new bass player Andy Heath. Serotonal also played at the Basinfire Festival and The Noc Plna Hvezd Festival both in the Czech Republic with Death Angel and Queensryche. The band also played closer to home throughout 2008, including the Bloodstock Festival in Derbyshire, UK. Simon Monkhouse was replaced by new drummer Wayne Denny in April 2009.

Serotonal released their debut album 'Monumental - Songs of Misery and Hope' in November 2009 via Union Black Records. In 2010, the band announced the departures of Gary Hill and Andy Heath. Matt Ford from Torture Garden has since replaced Hill on guitar, and Mike Hollows has been brought in to replace Heath. Following long term complications regarding Denny's involvement, he has been replaced on drums by Chaz Skelhorn. The band are currently working on their second full length album, tentatively titled 'The Renunciant'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Serotonal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
