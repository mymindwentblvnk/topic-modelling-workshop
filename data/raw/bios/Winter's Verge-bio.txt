Formed in 2004, WINTER’S VERGE is the premier power/progressive metal band from Cyprus. The band self-released its first album, Another Life, Another End in 2006, to highly positive reviews across Europe. 

Another Life, Another End found its way to MYSTIC PROPHECY frontman R.D. LIAPAKIS, who found the record interesting and strong enough to pass onto LIMB MUSIC PRODUCTS, who upon hearing the album immediately offered the band a record contract. With R.D. LIAPAKIS at the helm and engineer CHRISTIAN SCHMIDT at PROPHECY AND MUSIC FACTORY STUDIOS in Germany, the band re-recorded the songs on Another Life, Another End and composed new ones, creating the band’s first label release, Eternal Damnation, released in 2008. This album also received strong reviews, and inspired WINTER’S VERGE into creating new material. 

The band returned to PROPHECY AND MUSIC FACTORY STUDIOS in mid-2009 and recorded the new album; more epic, more progressive, more technical. 2010 proved to be a pivotal year for the band: WINTER’S VERGE moved to MASSACRE RECORDS, and the band embarked on their first European tour, supporting power metal legends STRATOVARIUS on their POLARIS WORLD TOUR which won the band thousands of new fans, excited by their epic live performances and catchy, powerful songs. While on the tour, WINTER’S VERGE released their new album, TALES OF TRAGEDY, which was warmly received by Metal critics and public alike.

Following the success of TALES OF TRAGEDY, the band then began to write new material for the third album. Heavier, groovier material with some influences akin to SYMPHONY X, PANTERA and RAGE started to be added to the mix, resulting in a fresh, powerful sound. Again recorded in Germany under the guidance of R.D. LIAPAKIS and CHRISTIAN SCHMID, the new album, entitled BEYOND VEANGENCE, is to be released by MASSACRE RECORDS in February 2012. 

2012 is the year WINTER’S VERGE plan to invade the European Metal festival scene, and judging by the public reception on the STRATOVARIUS tour, the Metal festival goers are in for a major treat.
