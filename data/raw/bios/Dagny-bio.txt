Dagny (born Dagny Norvoll Sandvik on 23 July 1990 in Tromsø, Norway) is a Norwegian pop singer who had success with her debut single "Backbeat".

Extensive touring in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the UK lays the foundation for what is predicted to be a long and successful music career. 

With her crystal voice, ranging from raw and powerful to intimate and soft, Dagny describes her music as an “emotional rollercoaster” with playful peaks and melancholic drops, “just as life itself” she says. Her greatest love is performing, and to the stage she brings her intimate lyrics, harmonies and feelings, blended in a modern folk/pop blender filled with everything from darkness to eternal optimism. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dagny">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
