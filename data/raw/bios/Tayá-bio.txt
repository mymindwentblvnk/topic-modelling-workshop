Discovered aged 13 after attending a local choir, Liverpool singer-songwriter Tayá has spent the past few years perfecting her craft behind-the-scenes. But 2018 should be the year she truly breaks through. She's made huge steps in the last twelve months. 'When Ur Sober', a collaboration with fellow dscvr tip Yxng Bane, is a pristine emotional rollercoaster about love on the rocks. It swiftly earned her a support slot on Zara Larsson's UK tour, playing arenas across the UK.  

When she's not on the road, Tayá's glued to the studio, collaborating with the likes of Starsmith, Diztortion and Snakehips while working on her Atlantic-signed debut album. In theory, she's testing the waters with as many producers and songwriters as possible, but her 2017 self-titled debut EP puts down a marker for emotionally sophisticated, seriously assured hit-making. "Don't tell me to be patient, I'm tired of waiting," she sings on 'When Ur Sober'. It shouldn't be long before her inevitable superstardom finally takes hold. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tay%C3%A1">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
