They are most famous for their debut single "Open Up Your Mind" which was used as an insert song in the anime Gensoumaden Saiyuki. There is also a Mandarin version of "Open Up Your Mind" named 放开 (fang kai). Mirai also later released two mini-albums PINK and BLUE in Japan simultaneously - featuring songs in Japanese, English, and Mandarin.
