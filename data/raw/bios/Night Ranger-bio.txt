Night Ranger is an American rock band from San Francisco that formed in 1982 and gained popularity during the 1980s with a series of albums and singles.
The band's first five albums sold more than 10 million copies worldwide  and have sold 17 million albums total. After their success waned in the late 1980s, the band split up in 1989 and its members pursued other musical endeavours including group and solo efforts. Brad Gillis and Kelly Keagy teamed up with bassist Gary Moon and released an album without the other original band members in 1995, but the band soon re-united to release two new albums in the latter half of the decade.
