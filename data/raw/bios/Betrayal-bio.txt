3) German Death metal band Betrayal.

 Founded in Aschaffenburg in 2005, BETRAYAL soon released 'Of Lust And Loss' in 2007, an EP that stirred up the local underground, sold out on the day of release and showed the potential of the young band around drummer Manuel Caccamese.

After several line-up changes, BETRAYAL found themselves together again in 2014. With Alex Burkl on rhythm guitar/vocals and Philipp Gherig on bass, a foundation was finally laid to build a golden future on. They quickly drew attention to themselves again with a demo in 2015.

In 2016, eleven years after the band was founded, BETRAYAL released their first album 'Infinite Circles' on Transcending Records. They were able to gain many new fans and received nothing but great reviews.
With their new addition Bastian Kraus on Lead Guitar in January 2019, they not only got fresh blood but also musical quality and creativity on board. BETRAYAL hit the studio 2019, working on their second full length album 'Disorder Remains' which was released via Rising Nemesis Records on April 16th 2021.
