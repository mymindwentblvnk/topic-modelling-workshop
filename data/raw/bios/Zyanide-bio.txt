Zyanide was founded in 2005. Dani sent his Demo-Tape to Time and he was enthusiastic about it. So they decided to do a Jam-Session which unfortunately never took place because there was no location to play. After half a year they found a bandroom in Zofingen. Andi, a friend of Time, got to be the second guitarist and Phil, Time's brother, got to be the keyboard player. Roger gave his voice for Zyanide. After a year and many rehearsals Zyanide decided to split up with Roger in autumn 2006. Dani took over the voices. At the same time Zyanide recorded their first songs. Now, in spring 2007 Zyanide is writing and recording more songs and looking for some Gigs.
