1)  Starve is a metalcore band from Melbourne

2) The music of STARVE is a soundtrack to all the filth, despair, injustice, fear and greed we see in the world around us. The band is inspired by music ranging from the harsh bleakness of sludge metal to the gritty defiance of old blues songs, sometimes mixing these with the unhurried attitudes of legendary southern rock bands. 

After releasing a demo early in 2010 and playing a variety of shows, the debut full length record 'Wasteland' was recorded during the blistering heat of the summer of the same year. This LP was released by Badger Records on September 17, 2010 and was followed by several individual shows and short tours throughout the rest of the year. In 2011 Starve cranked up the volume to ’11, played yet more shows, and recently released a 7” to follow their debut LP. ‘Black Sludge, White Sludge’ was officially released on the 9th of September in a musky cellar in Leipzig. In the near future three new songs will be recorded for a split with TERZIJ DE HORDE.
