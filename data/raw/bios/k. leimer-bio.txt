Kerry Leimer (credited on releases as K. Leimer) is a musician and composer music born in Winnipeg, Canada, and raised in the United States.

Heavily influenced by the ambient and minimalist works of Brian Eno, German kosmische bands such as Cluster and Faust, and the surrealist and Dada movements, Leimer and his wife Dorothy Cross founded the Palace of Lights label in Seattle, Washington, in 1979 as an outlet for his own recordings and for the works of other artists based in the Pacific Northwest (like Marc Barreca). He also cites other Krautrock groups such as Can, Neu!, Harmonia, and early Kraftwerk; musique concrete and avant-garde artists on Eno's Obscure label including Gavin Bryars, David Toop, Max Eastley, Penguin Cafe Orchestra, and Michael Nyman; Frank Zappa; and Fripp & Eno's collaborative record (No Pussyfooting) as influencing him to pursue his experiments in electronic music.

He released four full-length albums, a soundtrack to Alan Greenberg's 1982 Jamaica documentary Land of Look Behind, a seven-inch single, and a compilation, in addition to two releases with the more rhythmically inclined group Savant, until ceasing activity in 1983 in order to focus on the design agency he co-founded with his wife.

Starting in 2001 Leimer began recording again, reviving the Palace of Lights imprint and reissuing much of his older material. To date he has issued another eight albums (some more drone oriented than previous releases), including collaborations with Barreca and fellow ambient musician Taylor Deupree. 

His work spread to a wider audience following RVNG's 2014 release of A Period of Review (Original Recordings: 1975â€“1983), a compilation of unreleased and archived material, which has received praise from publications like The Quietus, Dazed, and Pitchfork. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/K.+Leimer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
