THROUGH THE ASHES was found in Summer 2006 by Torsten Horstmann (ex-SYMBIONTIC) as a side-project to realize his musical visions not fitting into the concept of his main band.

Axel Schulze-Bisting : Vocals
Oliver Kaminski : Guitar
Jan Zanoth : Drums
Matthias Spaeth : Bass 
Torsten Horstmann : Guitar

Combining the energy of modern metalcore/hardcore and oldschool (death-)metal elements/melodies with the aim to create catchy and kicking songs!

Quickly finding mates for the instrumental positions and growing as a real band, Torsten decided to completely concentrate on TTA and therefore left his former band. Permanently working on new material, rehearsing and checking out singers it took them until December to find Axel Schulze-Bisting, the perfect man for the job on the microphone. TTAÂ´s first self-produced CD ("The End Of Evolution") will be released at the end of March 2007... from there on they will concentrate on their live set to kick your ass on stage ...  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Through+The+Ashes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
