Fallen Fate are a Thrash Metal band from the North East UK.  Starting out in 2005, the band have came along way and have been through many line up changes to be where they are today.

In Late 2007/Early 2008, Fallen Fate began work on their first EP, which sumed up the bands sound so far in 5 Metal Tracks. The Self Produced and Released 'Revengance' EP, has received much positive feedback from fans and critics, with some label interest and a slot on Bruce Dickinsons Rock Show on BBC 6 Music.  All of the Hard Copies of the EP are now Sold Out.

The band are currently working on a string of new tracks which will be performed at Live shows in 2010, as they prepare to take their music to wider audiences and plan a full length release.

Influenced by early Thrash Metal bands such as Testament and Onslaught, along with the New Wave of American Metal, Fallen Fate bring a mix of Speed and Heavy Technical Riffs into their music and are definitely a band to look out for in the near future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fallen+Fate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
