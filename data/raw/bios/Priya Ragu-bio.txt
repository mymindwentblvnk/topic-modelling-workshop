Tamil-Swiss musician Priya Ragu flavors her own take on R&B with a depth of musical influences from her Sri Lankan heritage. Priya is not only a remarkable talent but also one with a sound quite unlike anyone else. Her limitless potential has established her as a breakthrough artist, resulting in airplay at Radio 1, 1Xtra, 6 Music and the BBC Asian Network, plus Ones To Watch tips from Vogue, i-D, NME, The Line Of Best Fit, gal-dem, The Forty-Five and Notion.

Priya now takes the next step in a major year ahead by sharing her new single ‘FORGOT ABOUT’. If you think you know what to expect from Priya, think again. ‘FORGOT ABOUT’ is a timeless slow jam which really showcases the versatility of Priya’s vocal gift. The production, courtesy of her brother Japhna Gold, strikes the perfect balance between innovative sonic flourishes and the yearning of a timeless love song.

“The track is about being in love with that ‘forever' person, who has feelings for you but it’s not quite love,” says Priya. “It's about being afraid of letting go, because you know that you'll never meet someone like this again in your lifetime - so you decide to carry them always in your heart.”

Outside of her own releases, Priya also has her first major collaboration on the cards. She features on ‘Goodbye My Love’, a song on Jungle’s forthcoming third album ‘Loving In Stereo’ which will be released in August 2021. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Priya+Ragu">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
