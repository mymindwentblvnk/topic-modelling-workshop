Melancolia is a Melodic Black Metal project by Eric Saumier of Canada. 

An appropriate description of the music according to genre sets Melancolia in black metal. Note the attention paid to synthesis and more symphonic arrangements, along with time signature alterations and their ilk and a thin line is drawn between progressive metal and neoclassical, however the majority of the first record possesses more of a black metal overtone.

The debut album, "The Dark Reflection of Your Soul," is a nine-track walk through the psyche of the perplexing concept of human desperation. Noteworthy is the length of time taken in composing and recording the record -- 7 years. The album spans 9 minutes shy over an hour.

Since said debut, no further information has been added to Eric's label, Winterart Productions, or Melancolia's official site about a continuance. It's not yet known or assumed that the band is dormant or in the process of another album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Melancolia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
