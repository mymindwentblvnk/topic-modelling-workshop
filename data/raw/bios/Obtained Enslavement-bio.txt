More black metal from the bottomless well of black metal that is Norway, Obtained Enslavement has forged a moderately successful career that spans well over a decade (they formed in 1989) and four albums. The original Obtained Enslavement line-up was Pest (vocals & bass, Gorgoroth), DÃ¸den (guitar), and Torquemada (drums). Another member, Heks (guitar & keyboard), joined the band in 1992. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Obtained+Enslavement">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
