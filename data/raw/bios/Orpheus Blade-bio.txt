Orpheus Blade, a prog metal project written, composed and led by female vocalist Adi Bitran, announces first details about the debut album.

The official press release reads: “We’re excited to finally reveal that the amazing Henning Basse (Metalium, Epysode, Sons of Seasons, MaYan) will take a part in the upcoming album Wolf’s Cry as a lead vocalist. This album was rearranged, produced and recorded by Erez Yohanan (from Israeli well-praised band Amaseffer) in the monstrous Cast Iron Studios and will be mixed and mastered by Jacob Hansen in Denmark next month. The lineup includes the drummer Shaked Furman (ex-Metal Battle contest winner “The Fading”), the guitarist Gal Ben-Haim and the bassist Edi Lemishov (Sensorium).


“Wolf’s Cry is an eclectic collection of shapes and colors. It’s metal that goes hand in hand with film music and orchestrations, layers upon layers of cruel guitars and carefully written lyrics. It will hold much of your own essence in it along with your demons of decades. It is not only the epic fantasy it claims to be – but also a journey into your deepest emotions, to the burning core of the beast inside. It’s always dark here, always restless, and we hope you can find yourself in this scenery, a one that we have carefully bled for to carve for you. Wait for updates about this unique project during 2014 – the year of the Wolf.
