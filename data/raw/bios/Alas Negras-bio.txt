Puertorican Heavy Metal band, from the town of Caguas. Formed in 2003 by their vocalist Giancarlos Martinez, it has gone through several line up changes and has produced four albums. “Facing The If”, Alas Negras 4th album, proves why this band shows no sign of slowing down. The vocals give a myriad of emotions to each song. They haunt, and guide, us through a sea of tales that capture the imagination. Fast, powerful, loud, and melodic, twin guitars set the pace of fist pounding, horn raising Metal. The bass pounds and beat like the heart of a warrior ready for battle. The drums sound the attack. With every strike, you feel a fire bursting from your chest & running through your veins. 

Alas Negras has shared the stage with many acts, such as; Fear Factory, Soulfly, Powerglove, Flotsam & Jetsam and James Rivera of Helstar, to name a few. 

With Alas Negras there are no limits to what they can do. By playing the music they love, they transport us to a time when Metal was about telling a story. Giving their all to make the fans remember what head banging, raising your devil horn, and get sucked into an album is all about. There are no styles or fads, only Metal and Metal is what the fans want… and shall receive.
