In October of 2001, Throcult entered "Flatline Studios" with producer Dave Otero to create an 8-song demo entitled "De Facto". This was also released independently. With the release of this disc, it established Throcult as a unique, creative, talented group with a very big influence in the Colorado Metal scene. 2002 found Throcult doing minor touring and large metal festivals across America. It also found them entering "Flatline Studios" once more to record a 3 song demo entitled "Hunted". A limited number of copies were made and given away for free to promote the band and a new, longer album to come in 2003. The demo included "Kill or be Killed", "Hunted", and "Eclipse of the Blood Moon". Between "De Facto" and "Hunted", there was a rumored album called "The Flower of Flesh and Blood". Nothing ever came of it, however and "Hunted" was released. It is around this time after sending out copies of "Hunted" across America that Throcult begins to do local/national shows regularly and added a 2nd guitarist Ivan Alcala . They also gained a spot at the Milwaukee MetalFest in 2002 and later that same year Dusty Parson exited the band who was then replaced by Jeremy Portz on drums. During 2003 to 2005 period Brian Fisher, Chris Vigil, Cassie Begay, Jeremy Portz and Nick Jackson left Throcult. 
Throcult is now called "Nexhymn". Only Ivan Alcala remains as a former Throcult member. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Throcult">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
