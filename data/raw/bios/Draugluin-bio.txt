There are two artists named Draugluin:

(1) Is a American black metal act, formed around April 2006 by Satus/Alda guitar player Jace Bruton F.K.A. Lycaon in an effort to completely express all of his emotions and beliefs. Depressive black metal at its finest. The songs were recorded on tape, so obviously the quality is not that great, but the message is clear.

(2) A Greek black metal one man band with strong nationalist and pagan influences. It was formed by Thyrronas on 2004. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Draugluin">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
