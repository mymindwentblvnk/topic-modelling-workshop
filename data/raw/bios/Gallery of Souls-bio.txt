Things went from "bad" to "good" when Seattle-area musicians Jim Alkire (bass) and Nathan Hartmann (guitar) veered off the dead-end street called "Cover Band" and headed in a new direction; writing original rock/power pop songs for a CD recording project. Early in the going, while a substantial list of promising songs were being worked up, Jimâ€™s longtime friend, Mike Jamieson, joined the effort, and after several slamming rehearsals the trio hit the studio. As the recordings began to take shape, lead guitarist Bobby Burrows, another buddy from way back (of both Jim and Mike), was brought in, adding the final polish to the songs. Encouraged by the synergy of their musicianship, the quality of the songs and the prospects for future musical creation, the four musicians declared, "This is good!" and a new band, Gallery of Souls, was on the map. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gallery+of+Souls">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
