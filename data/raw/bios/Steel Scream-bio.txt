Steel Scream was formed in late 2006 but all of us have plenty of previous experience in different bands and projects. Our first show took place already in January 2007. Since then we have given many gigs in Estonia, including performing at rock festivals.

Unexpectedly, local audience welcomed us warmly almost at once. Especially younger generation of rockers and metalheads. Our back-to-the- roots attitude works.

Various Estonian radio stations have started to play our songs; we have showed up in Estonian national TV and received good reviews in main Estonian newspapers.

“Lock n’load and get ready!”

Early 2008 we self-released our first EP “Lock n’load and get ready!” For this performance we chose five songs to present to you.
Why such title? Well…

Life is a war, they say.
Love is a war, they say.
War is in our blood.
So lock n’load and get ready! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Steel+Scream">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
