Communal Grave is one of the premier bands in the pakistani metal and is responsible for revolutionising the art of moshing and headbanging in Pakistani gigs, as well as introducing the Wall of Death for the first time. Their originals have all been highly popular, especially the song "Anomaly" which has become an anthem of the underground Karachi scene. Musically, they fall under the extreme metal banner, fusing elements of death metal, thrash metal, metalcore and groove metal into a sound that is entirely their own.

Before the band started , Nabeel (Lead/Rhythm Guitars) and Saad (Lead/Rhythm Guitars) were already working on an instrumental project when they decided to hunt for greener (read heavier) pastures. In the summer of 2006 , through a friend they met up with Jimi (Bass) , Moiz (Vocals) and Asaas (Drums) , who happened to be looking for two guitarists for a death metal project. Things fell into place after a few jams , and the band was christened 'Communal Grave' , the name being inspired by the lyrics of one of their all time favourite bands , Carcass. Sickened by the local 'pop' scene , they set about carving their own niche in the underground community of Karachi . After their debut track , Servitude, and a few experimental compositions , they honed their sound to their own liking in Anomaly. With a few gigs under their belt , the band has set down again to record their latest compositions. Saad was replaced by Maaz on 5/17/2009 Maaz was replaced by Faraz. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Communal+Grave">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
