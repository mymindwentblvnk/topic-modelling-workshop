Alexandra Savior McDermott is an American singer-songwriter originally from Portland, Oregon. Her debut album, Belladonna of Sadness, was released by Columbia Records on April 7, 2017. Savior's second album, The Archer, was released by 30th Century Records on January 10, 2020.

She was born on June 14, 1995 in Portland, Oregon and attended school in the Portland metropolitan area. She first became interested in songwriting at age 14, in part inspired by her older brother, also a musician. Different in attitude and appearance from many of the other female students, she had a difficult go of it socially and had to change high schools.

Savior, known then by her birth name, first achieved public attention in September 2012 when as a 17-year-old her rendition of "Big Jet Plane" was spotted on YouTube by Courtney Love, who said "This girl is gonna be huge!". By April 2013, she had done a little modeling for Erin Fetherston and said she hoped her first album would be out soon. She graduated from high school in June 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alexandra+Savior">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
