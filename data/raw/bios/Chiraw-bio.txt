Chiraw, fusion of the words: chi and raw. Chi or Qi in its Chinese origin stand for: vital energy and raw just states the pure form of this energy that’s filling the air when Chiraw takes the stage.

Formed and based in Overijssel, the Netherlands since January 2006, Chiraw tries to let their music be heard in every way possible. Setting in with their combination of heavy, energized, brutal riffs, industrial atmospheric samples, crystal clean melodies, killer shouts and ground pounding beats to energize the scene. Inspired by many artists and genres drove this quintet to create “that” of their own.
