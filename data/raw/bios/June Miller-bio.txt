(1) June Miller (http://www.myspace.com/junemillerdnb)

After a few years working together with & playing in bands, Bart & Mark (Mark McCann and Bart van Dijk (former guitarist of hardcore band Deluge) finally found and feel in love with the Drum and Bass vibes after Mark's move from the UK to NL. After a few trips to parties in Utrecht in 2006 they where hooked and continued there search for bigger and better things. After the purchase of turntables and a few records they were rolling! Still total novices to the game after only sitting behind logic from late 2007, there wiliness took off, and they were nominated for the best up & coming act @ the DNB Awards in 2007. 2008 saw June Miller focus on their love of music with a drive! Busy in the studio lead them to grabbing the attention of the artists they have followed from the start, like Loxy, Instra:mental, dBridge, Spirit, Bailey, Sabre, Gremlinz, Icicle, Nymfo and many more. A love for the deeper side and the versatility is always a big point for the guys as well what drum and bass is known for = deep rolling dancefloor music!
