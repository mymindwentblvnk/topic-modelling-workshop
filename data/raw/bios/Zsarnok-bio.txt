(The members' names are displayed in the Hungarian way: family name precedes the given name)

The name of the band is the Hungarian for "Tyrant". The music is inspired by the legendary 80s' thrash metal era, especially the German thrash scene (Kreator, Sodom, Destruction etc.). All lyrics are in Hungarian, covering topics quite common for a band of this style (war, aggression, disasters, anger...).

Before Zsarnok, most members played in the Thrash Metal band C-DEXTRIN, a lesser known Hungarian band dating back to the early 90s, but practically inactive since 1998. Coming alive again by forming a new band, with the addition of "Lord Tormentor", the band recorded their first 7 song demo in March 2008, featuring three re-recorded C-Dextrin songs, two more (previously unreleased) songs from C-Dextrin with new lyrics, and two brand new tracks. The next release is planned for Spring 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zsarnok">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
