Forming in February 2011, The Rubens are a four piece blues and soul band from a small town south of Sydney. Taking influences from The Black Keys, The Rolling Stones and the Jimi Hendrix Experience among others, the band consists of three brothers and a childhood friend. Over time the band has evolved from their blues roots and have shifted their sound firmly into indie rock. 
Members include Zaac Margin on lead guitar, Elliott Margin on keys/vocals, Sam Margin on guitar/vocals and Scott Baldwin on drums.
