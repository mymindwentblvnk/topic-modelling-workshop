Luciferi was a black metal band formed in April 1994 in São Paulo, Brazil. They only issued two demos, "Thy Fullmoon Rites" (1994) and "Demo-Ensaio" (unknown year), both of which contain the only members "Lord of the Darkness" and "Beelzebuth Guardian." There isn’t too much information to find about Luciferi. The band began with five members (whose identities are unknown), with who they recorded one rehearsal tape, and then the remaining three members were kicked out. It is unknown when Luciferi split up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Luciferi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
