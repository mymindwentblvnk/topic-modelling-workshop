From Brighton UK. Not to be confused with the Death Metal band from Montreal. 

Demental blend aggression, power, speed, emotion and performance to create a truly new sound based in the classic thrash of decades past and refined with modern metal brutality. Rising from the ashes of a scene once forgotten we come to lay waste to the myriad of U.K. heavy metal dead losses. In a little over three years we have released a single worldwide, a music video, and a debut E.P.

With an unrelenting dedication to the cause only time stands in the way of this band.
