5. Tormento is spawned from illness.There is no better way to put it.
And its sole objective is to express what illness does to me...in a grim and dark artistic way. 
It is not supposed to be beautiful or to calm you down, but rather to cause uneasiness and discomfort on the listener.
Tormento is going to be a collection of sounds if you will...
I will only release tracks when illness haunts me.  https://666tormento.bandcamp.com/ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tormento">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
