Formed in Charleston, SC in late 2009, Hooded Eagle has released an eponymous demo (2009), an EP ('Two Counts of Perjury', 2010), a digital split (Hooded Eagle/Wolf Lord, 2013) and a full-length album ('Nightscapes from the Abyssal Plane', 2015). After replacing both original guitarists, in 2010 and 2012, they have slowly moved away from their post-metal roots to become a full-fledged doom metal band incorporating other extreme genres into their sound. They have shared the stage with such notable acts as High on Fire, Eyehategod, Crowbar, Darkest Hour, Kylesa, Black Tusk, Jucifer, Shroud Eater, Skeletonwitch, Phobia and Hollow Leg. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hooded+Eagle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
