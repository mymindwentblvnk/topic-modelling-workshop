The Leechmaster project begins in the year 2000, in San Juan, Argentina. Although the genre is mainly Heavy Metal, influences from distant genres are also introduced, such as flamenco, arabic & tribal percussions, etc. Although it sounds pretty much like a band, in fact it is formed by one member, and recordings are made in multi track. The self-titled 2005 EP compiles songs from the early days of the project, until the year of its release, with a wide display of sounds that have been achieved during time. The newest songs, Anhelos and Criaturas, were recorded in the year 2006 and released in 2007 and 2008 respectively in the website. Later in 2008, a background song made for a radio station was released under the name of Cortina 666 Heavy Radio. In 2009, the long waited 2-track record including remastered versions of Anhelos and Criaturas gets released under the name of Entre Anhelos & Criaturas. This record also includes an ambient/symphonic version of Criaturas, along with Cortina 666 Heavy Radio as a bonus tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Leechmaster">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
