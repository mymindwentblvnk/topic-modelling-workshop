Epic Metal embraces what we feel is the core element of heavy metal: transcendence. Like the best music from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, true Epic Metal does not rely on gimmicks or technical bravura, but well-arranged songs featuring creative riffs, tasty solos and dramatic yet earnest vocals.

Each band that inspires us sounds different: Compare the gothic quirkiness of Dark Quarterer to the barbaric directness of Ironsword, or compare the finesse and elaborate compositions of recent Battleroar to the raw-and-rough music of Morningstar. We are inspired by all of these bands, but are not content to ape them: With Realmbuilder, we feel that we have carved out a unique heavy metal persona. Although we are not a Doom Metal band, the spaciousness and cumulative progressions often found in that genre (especially in Reverend Bizarre, Minotauri, While Heaven Wept & Epic/Doom masters DoomSword) are things we appreciate and try to achieve with our mostly mid-paced and occasionally slow Epic Metal music. We want our songs to conjure an old lost world wherein men’s battles are set against fantastical and regal and ruined landscapes. We are not angry or rebellious and we have nothing to prove— we are lifelong metalheads who set out to do one thing: Create the songs that we want to hear
