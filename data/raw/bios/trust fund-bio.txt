Trust Fund was a musical project founded and led by Ellis Jones while living in Bristol in the southwest of England. Both on recordings and live, the band also featured a rotating lineup of musicians to fill out the sound. They released four full-length albums between 2015 and 2018, the final of which roughly coincided with the decision to disband.

The band self-released an EP titled I've Been Ages, followed by a second, Don't Let Them Begin, and a split EP with Joanna Gruesome, the latter two issued by Reeks of Effort. In early 2015, they signed to Turnstile Records for the release of their first full-length album, "No One's Coming for Us".

Their next album, Seems Unfair, followed shortly after on the same label in the autumn of 2015.

After a relocation to Leeds, a third album, We Have Always Lived in the Harolds, was released in June 2016. Reverting to home recording, it was also released without a record label. The title is a reference to Shirley Jacksonâ€™s 1962 novel We Have Always Lived in the Castle, substituting in a group of streets in Leeds collectively known as the Harolds, where Jones lived.

In July 2018, Trust Fund released their fourth and final full-length album, Bringing the Backline.

During their period of activity, Trust Fund toured with Los Campesinos!, Speedy Ortiz, and Mitski. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trust+Fund">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
