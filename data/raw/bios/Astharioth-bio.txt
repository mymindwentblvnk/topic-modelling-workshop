Biography :

A one man Experimental metal project started in 2013 by Asthar Sagos

Once our world was a place full of creation and well oiled trains on the track.
But now the paths were crushed when i walked on my journey for inner peace.
The time has come for Astharioth to raise her armies, deep buried within the grounds wich were once walked by her might.
