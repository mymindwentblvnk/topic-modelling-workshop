They were soon joined by the Bangkok Babes drummer Per-Helge “Peppa” Bruvoll, and guitarist Tore Moren from Jorn, Arcturus and Carnivora among others. They looked around for a vocalist for some time without luck. Lars then went on a holiday to Rhodes to relax his soul. In the biggest live venue in Rhodes city, the Colorado Club, he saw and heard Michael Bormann (Jaded Heart, Bonfire, J.R. Blackmore, Zeno, etc.) perform some numbers that caught his im-mediate attention. The chemistry between Michael and the other guys was a sure thing from the first minute.
