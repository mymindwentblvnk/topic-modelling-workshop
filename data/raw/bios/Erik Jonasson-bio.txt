Promising young talent Erik Jonasson, a 23 year-old singer and songwriter from Gothenburg, released debut single 'Like a Funeral', out April 13, 2016

Erik played guitar in a post-punk band and had not sung officially before. But at the end of high school, he started writing songs on his own. He got tired of the electric guitar and all the effects and started to play more acoustic. 

Erik's music is cinematic and even fits in the movie proven when his single was used recently in a scene of the series ''The Vampire Diaries''. Great for a Swedish songwriter any use of American series like that, and a good springboard in career. But it is not only the soundtrack Erik draws inspiration from.
It's mostly single songs, he had listened a lot to the Icelandic composer Ólafur Arnalds. Since he love ''Time'' by Hans Zimmer from the Inception soundtrack and classic like Nils Frahm. 
He started playing pick-accompaniment on the guitar after he had seen Anna Ternheim. Certainly there is no unusual way to play on, but for Erik it was new, artists such as José González, Elliott Smith and Regina Spector. 

Erik is currently working on new songs in Gothenburg. He will follow up the debut single with a new song this summer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Erik+Jonasson">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
