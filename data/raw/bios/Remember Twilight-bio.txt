Remember Twilight from Germany take the concept of metal plus classical instruments beyond the medieval metal cliche.
Featuring oboe and two violins, they fuse metal and punk rock influences with soft classical chamber music, creating Kammermusik-Core ("chamber music core"), as they call it. On top of that, hardcore-style shoutings with German
lyrics - often on philosophical topics - are added in for a wild musical ride.

In 2005 Remember Twilight released their debut album "Zerrissen", produced by Alex Krull (Atrocity, Leaves' Eyes)
After the release, Remember Twilight played on European tours with bands like Finnish cross-over legend Waltari and German medieval metal orchestra Haggard.
