Sisqó (born Mark Althavan Andrews) is an R&B singer, one of the five members of Dru Hill. After Woody left the group in 1999 to pursue a solo career, it was decided that the other three members would do the same. Sisqó was the only member besides Woody to actually release his solo LP (Jazz recorded a solo LP that was shelved, and Nokio never finished his). Sisqó's solo debut. Unleash the Dragon, was released on Def Soul Records in November 1999. Unleash the Dragon sold moderately at first, until the February 2000 release of its second single, "Thong Song". A runaway hit, "Thong Song" and its follow-up, "Incomplete," were major hits on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, with "Thong Song" making it to number-three, and "Incomplete" going to number-one. The success later got Sisqó a Doll made of himself by Play Along Toys in 2001.

Conflicts within the group prevented Dru Hill from reuniting as planned in late 2000, and Sisqó set about recording a second solo LP. During this period, Sisqó branched out into television, hosting the dance competition program Sisqó's Shakedown on MTV, and film, taking on supporting roles in the films Get Over It (2001) with Kirsten Dunst and Snow Dogs with Cuba Gooding, Jr.. Although his second LP, Return of Dragon, released in June 2001, eventually went platinum, its singles "Can I Live" and "Dance With Me" performed far below expectations, and by 2002, Sisqó was back with Dru Hill, who released their third LP in late 2002. The LP underperformed, and the group was eventually released from their record contract. Sisqó is currently working independently on a third solo album, tentatively titled Last Dragon, for release between late 2006 and mid-2007. The first single "Who's Ur Daddy" will be released November with the video shoot in mid-October. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Sisq%C3%B3">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
