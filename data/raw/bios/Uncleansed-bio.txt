The band features members of BRACED FOR NAILS, INFERNAL DOMINION, SKOURGE and CRIMINALLY INSANE along with the ever prolific Shawn Whitaker (VIRAL LOAD, INSIDIOUS DECREPANCY...) on vocals.

The debut album, 'Domination of the Faithful' is expected for release late 2007 but demo tracks will be available soon.
