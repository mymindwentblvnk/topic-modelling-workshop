.357 Soundsystem was formed in winter 2004 by the ruins of Powerdose/Soul Above. In late nineties the band played some kind of rap-metal, but a bit later it started to formed in a more metal core style. Then suddenly in early 2000 band suffered some serious lack of interest and was in the dark for almost two years. Then, with some new energy, they started to play again, but soon after their second awakening their second guitarist and vocalist decided to quit. Gladly with a help of a friend, they found a new vocalist pretty soon and everything seemed to work out perfectly. Their music started to sound more hardcore with some death metal influences. Second, or actually first real demo, called "Torn from inside" was released in summer of 2006. Right now we are making some new songs and hopefully got more gigs soon. And get a deal. January 2007: Right now we are proud to tell, that we got some of our songs in Bomber Weekend 2006 DVD. Check it out! Summer 2007. On August 4th we finally got our new ep recorded, entitled "Beaten and Betrayed". Covers are made by Alpo Oksaharju from Hevein and the hoped release is sometime in the fall of -07. October 30th will be the release date of 272 Records compilation Kill City Vol 3, in which we got our "Broken (inside)" song. Feb 9, 2008 we finally released our ep "Beaten and betrayed" Four new trax of undisputed in-your-face deadly hardcore songs.
