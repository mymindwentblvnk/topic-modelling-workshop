A very raw and somewhat crusty death metal/grindcore band from Chicago, IL, USA. They were formed in 1990 and their only release is a demo-tape recorded in 11 March 1990, later re-released as "The Shame" as a 7" EP by Urban Alert Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Namland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
