Kaiju refers at least three different artists
[1] British dubstep duo;
[2] A metal band;
[3] A London based electronic DJ;
[4] Nerdcore hip-hop artist.

[1] Winners of "Best New Producers" at the 2013 DSF awards, no one is building made-for-system music quite like Kaiju; arguably two of the finest producers in the 140bpm space. Supporting much-lauded (and sold out) releases on Osiris Music, Lioncharge, and Ruffcut, Kaiju have have made a monumental impact on the scene in the short time they have been above ground. Now signed exclusively to the legendary DEEP MEDi MUSIK imprint, things are about to get heavy.

With audio support from the likes of Mary anne Hobbs, Mala, Vivek, Youngsta, J:Kenzo, N-Type, Biome, Distance, Truth and many more; it's safe to say Kaiju have carved themselves a spot in the dubstep history books.

[2] Nev wanted to get a project going using the genre of Monster movies as fuel for the songs. He contacted Elektrokutioner of Decrepitaph fame and we shot ideas back and forth. However, shortly after it was some what decided we were both to busy to do it and we put the beast to rest. Fast forward months later. Nev got in contact with Joel form Monument of Bones and we talked about waking the beast of slumber to do a few songs. Thus the beast rose from the depths to product the demo, "The Gods are Angry". It was met with decent reviews, soon after Joel and Nev marched on to create 9 more tracks for our full length, "Total Monster Armageddon" it was a self released deal and was once again met with pretty decent reviews. Currently on the threshold of release the new ep, "Unwilling Sacrifices" 6 songs of our own style of monster metal. Also working on some splits with several great bands, any labels interested please contact us.

Nev runs the label Shepherd of Rot Records.
