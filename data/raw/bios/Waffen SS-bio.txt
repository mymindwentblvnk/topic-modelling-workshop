Waffen SS may refer to

1) The Schutzstaffel of Nazi Germany

or

2) Waffen SS, a one man NSBM band formed by Herr Totenkopf (Daniele Melas) in Sardinia, Italy in  2001. By 2005, the project had dissipated. According to Totenkopf: 
"Waffen SS Want to comunicate, to avoid possibles misunderstandings, that their musical and political activity inside the NSBM and BM scene is ended years ago. Waffen SS want to get out the scene in every side, musical but expecially ideologic one, keeping finally and definitively distances from the scene."
