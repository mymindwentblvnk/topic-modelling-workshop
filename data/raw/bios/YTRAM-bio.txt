YTRAM is an alias that Martin Garrix use when he play a more Deep/Tech House set
The idea started when he play a deep house set in front of the people who had invites to enter the Ushuaia backstage area after his usual set. He then debuted his new alias, YTRAM, at his label STMPDâ€™s Tomorrowland showcase while wearing a mask.
Martin Garrix has quickly risen to the top of the charts over the years, and it's without a doubt that he will continue to do so being he's such a young prodigy. It's interesting to see which direction the YTRAM moniker will take Garrix. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/YTRAM">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
