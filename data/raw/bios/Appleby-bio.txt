An artist whose existence could only happen through the internet, Appleby began his career in 2014 by uploading the song "Beauty in Destruction" to Soundcloud. The song itself, produced by drip-133 and Steamy Peen, channeled the shadowy "PBR&B" aesthetics of artist like The Weeknd while adding in the cadence and soul-bearing lyricism of artists like Frank Ocean and James Blake. The track quickly caught fire, and earned the respect of fellow alt-R&B star Corbin and his group The Stand4rd. The following co-sign jettisoned Appleby into virtual internet superstardom, and his next few singles, "Rounded Edge," "Spit on Me," and "Find," generated even greater buzz, earning the emerging artist attention from magazines and online publications like Maxim and Complex.
