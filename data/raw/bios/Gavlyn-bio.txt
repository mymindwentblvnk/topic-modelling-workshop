The Los Angeles-based rapper Gavlyn (born January 29, 1990) has been rapping since 2006. She`s a member of the Movement Organized Threat and Broken Complex which supports artists on an international scale and aims to give Hip Hop music a fresh, poetic and timeless touch.

Gavlyns music is inspired by Old School, 70s Funk and 60's music. Yet, despite her devotion to Hip Hop, it`s not her only source of music. She`s also fond of Rock, Drum & Bass, House Music and Jungle Music. Cit: â€œIt`s important for the music to be open-minded and not to limit oneself." Gavlyn is one-of-a-kind. Even if her Beats sound like fresh from the 90s, her new album is interspersed with modern accents.

Her unique voice, her authentic and direct air, her diverse Flows and her exquisite Beats make her a real treat and a much wanted artist in the Rap crowd. Her debut album, From the Art was released in October 2012 by L.A. label Broken Complex and since then has been on the road to success. The song "What I Do", has been played 3.7 million times on YouTube so far.

After having performed exclusively in L.A. things took a dramatic turn when, at the start of 2013, Gavyln set out to conquer Europe. By now a whole lot of fans all over Europe have rejoiced in her shows! Her second album, Habit That You Blame, was released in April 2013.

On her third album, Modest Confidence, which was released in January 2014, she's taking a different approach in baby steps with a whole new flow and not so much boom bap only a little, peppered with contributions by producers from all over the world. Her refined rhymes give a hint at her personal development and show a new face of the young artist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gavlyn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
