TALES OF THE OLD is a Dark Symphonic Metal band from Athens,Greece.
The band was founded in 2010 by keyboard player Mike Tzanakis who is also the main composer and arranger of their music

His love for Symphonic metal acts like Rhapsody, Nightwish, Therion, Haggard and such, led him to form a band and contribute to this genre with a more Dark version of his favourite music.
The classical orchestrations are entwined with lyrics inspired by the Medieval Era, making the music of Tales Of The Old sound like a perfect soundtrack of the Dark Ages and the eternal battle of Good & Evil.

After releasing their first self-produced demo “Beware” in 2010, Mike Tzanakis decided to make the next step and work with producer Bob Katsionis (Firewind) who, in collaboration with the band formed the sound of the band as it can be heard today in this work.

The theatrical high-pitched vocals of singer/actor Vasilis Papadimitriou are completed by the majestic voice of Soprano singer Androniki Skoula (of Chaostar) who guested on all 3 tracks of this EP.

“The Passageway From Hell To Earth” is a digital-only release sold on iTunes and all the major digital music markets.
