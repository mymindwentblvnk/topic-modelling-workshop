Inharmonic is a young band from Joensuu, Finland. It was founded in spring 2007. The music can be characterized as technical death metal taking strong influences from old-school death metal. The band used to be called Exarch. It played in Metal Camp in Slovenia and in Germany among other things. Exarch fell apart after the tour in 2007 when some of its members moved to other towns in Finland. At that point the name of the band changed and the remaining members started working on new material with good results. In 2008 a new vocalist and a bassist joined the band. Since then the band has been very active. In the years 2010 and 2011 the band has played live several times and the feedback has been positive. 

Inharmonic recorded their first demo at Studio33 in Kuopio in February 2011. The demo carries the name “Ugly” and it was released in June 2011.
