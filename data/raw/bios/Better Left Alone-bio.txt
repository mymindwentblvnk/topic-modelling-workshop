Better Left Alone are a 5 piece, Preston (Lancashire, UK) based pop-punk band. The band came together in late 2007 and have since self released two EPs, however the first is out of print and has been put 'under a rock'.

Their second, self titled EP, released in March 2011, was produced by John Mitchell (who has fame in producing the last two You Me At Six records, as well as those of Enter Shikari and Funeral For A Friend).

The band has found local success with features on BBC Introducing and and BBC Unsigned Live session on BBC Lancashire. The bands first single, with a video, 'We Will Never Know' came in their top 40 (out of over 6000) songs of 2010.

The band have now recorded their 3rd EP during March of 2012, again at Outhouse Studio in Reading with John Mitchell. They plan on releasing the EP, titled 'Vegas Rules', June 4th. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Better+Left+Alone">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
