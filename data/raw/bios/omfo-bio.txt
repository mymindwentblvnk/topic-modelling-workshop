Known as GAS or Our Man From Odessa o.m.f.o., German Popov goes the way in which Kraftwerk never went. Using old synthesizers, ugly sounds of Casio keyboards and samples from various central European folk tracks, he makes crazy crossover tracks somewhere between dehumanized cold electronica, warm and energetic folk music and silly melodies. You can compare his music to the child parented by Kraftwerk and Senor Coconut.
