Tunguska Mammoth is a four-piece outfit hailing from Montreal, Quebec. Much like their namesake their sound is raw, massive and visceral. It would be easy to throw the modern stoner & sludge etiquette at them but they offer so much more to their listeners; a sound crafted over years of honing their skills that incorporates sheer sonic brutality and addictive groove laden riffs. Deathbound Records is now joining forces with Tunguska Mammoth for the release of their second album Breathless. Constantly active, the band has quite an impressive resume to boot. Thanks to their intense live performances following the release of their first full length in 2013, the band has since then garnered a lot of attention and went on to share the stage with high-profile acts such as Ufomammut, Monolord, Usnea and Castle to name a few. Keeping in line with their DIY ethics Breathless was actually recorded by band member Pierre-Hugues Rondeau at Apollo Studios in Montreal. The album brings forth a wide & diverse array of inspirations to the Tunguska Mammoth sound audiences have come to know. Going back and forth between atmospheric pieces and intense sonic blasts each track shoots straight for gut. With Breathless, Tunguska Mammoth is not afraid to expand their horizons and explore a broader range of tones, feels and sounds. The band comes highly recommended if you are a fan of like High on Fire, Baroness, Mastodon, Red Fang or Torche. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tunguska+Mammoth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
