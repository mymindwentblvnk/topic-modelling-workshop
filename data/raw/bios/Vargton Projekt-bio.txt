Vargton Projekt, a band based around some of the finest musical talents to have emerged in recent years from Sweden in guitarist Mats Hedberg (on Guitars + Sitar & Ebow), Grammy winning drummer Morgan Ågren and vocalist Björn Jansson. The original thought for the first album “ProgXpriMetal” was to be an instrumental CD but Mats had an idea to ask one of Sweden’s finest metal vocalists Björn Jansson (Tears Of Anger / Ride The Sky) to put some vocals on selected tracks. Other guest musicians on “ProgXpriMetal” are: Giovanni Imparato - Percussion & Animal Voices. Hans Lundin - Organ & Nord Lead. Alessandro Gwis - Keyboards & Laptop Sampler. Lars Eric Mattsson - Guitar solos on some tracks. Fabrizio Sciannameo, Lorenzo Feliciati, Marco Caudai — Bass. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vargton+Projekt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
