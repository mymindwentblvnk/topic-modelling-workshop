No Wyld (formerly known as The Wyld) are a New Zealand indie rock band, formed in 2010 by Mo Kheir, Brandon Black and Joe Pascoe, who have remained constant members. They are commonly referred to as a hip-hop, rock or indie rock band, with much of their music containing rap as an element. Their song "Let Me Know" appears in the FIFA 16 soundtrack and has surpassed 2 million views on YouTube. Their song "Odyssey" appears on the soundtrack of NHL15, Madden 16, Warren Miller's 2014 ski film "No Turning Back" and Need For Speed.

Mo Kheir and Joe Pascoe met while studying architecture at university in 2007. They joined Brandon Black two years later at a local music jam night. They began as a bedroom-producing act, covering tracks they liked, and performing at open mic nights.

"Revolution" was the first single that attracted attention online. The track earned praise from MTV Iggy in the United States and was subsequently included in United States TV show 90210. No Wyld released their debut album, Preface, on 29 June 2012. The band played at the Loft at Q Theatre to celebrate the release. The band attracted the interest of major sponsors like Red Bull, who included them in a major campaign. In August 2013 they began recording their first EP, Abstract, at Red Bull Studios.

The track "Odyssey" was used in a commercial for McDonald's during Sochi 2014, and later included in the soundtrack for NHL 15, Madden NFL 16 and Need for Speed. "Odyssey" was also featured in the pregame video played before the West Virginia University Mountaineers football team took the field for home games during the 2015 season. In addition, "Let Me Know" was included in the soundtrack for FIFA 16. This song also appeared in EA Sports game, FIFA 17 with "Justfayu" featuring KAMAU. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/No+Wyld">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
