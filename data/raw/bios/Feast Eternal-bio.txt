Feast Eternal started out in the winter of 1992 with John Greenman (ex-Infested) and T.J. Humlinski (ex-Infested). Late in October of 1993 the lineup was completed by the addition of drummer, Matt Skrzypczak. 

In early 2000 Feast Eternal released upon the world their debut album, "Prisons of Flesh." "Prisons of Flesh" was met with critical acclaim and produced a loyal fan base, even leading them to receive attention from a major metal record label. However due to personal reasons John left the band before Feast was able to proceed with future endeavors, putting the band on hold for a long period of time. 

Fast forward to June 2006. The remaining members of Feast Eternal (T.J. & Matt) make their presence known again within the scene and begin writing material for a new Feast Eternal album. In a short time Open Grave Records took interest in working with Feast Eternal and in mid-July 2006 the relationship was solidified. 

In late 2006 the original, "Prisons of Flesh" album was reissued in it's original form and will include two new tracks as a bonus to tie fans over for the full length return of Feast Eternal in early 2007.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Feast+Eternal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
