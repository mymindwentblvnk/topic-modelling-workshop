Members from the early 1990’s bands: Maldicion, Lord Blasphemer & Severed have resurrected the bone crushing Chicago metal sound influenced by Celtic Frost, Slayer, Sodom, Dark Angel, Obituary, Kreator, Exodus, Devastation, Etc. Their live show is an assault to the senses. Blasting & thrashing a fierce attack of Death Metal.
