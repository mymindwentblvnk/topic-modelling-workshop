Eye of Anubis is a melodic death metal monster from Toms River, NJ. Born from the minds of Jeff Rosario, and Robert Babcock, these two gathered the forces needed to overcome diversity in the work place. Eugene Pistilli was recruited in the year 2011 to fit the spot of vocalist, and ever since he has proven his worth in sex appeal, and stage presence. After some line up changes we currently recruited John D the Epic on guitar. His curvacious swings, and brutal riffs surely bring a evil feel to the tunes. We strive to reach the ears of our friends, and fellow fans of metal, and hope that we can be heard all over the world. keep it Brutal, and stay metal!!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eye+Of+Anubis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
