In 2000, Mathieu Hocine started his project "Kid Francescoli". He was soon joined by Laetitia Abello (vocals), David Borras (keyboards) and Olivier Scalia (bass). They played their first gigs in 2004.

Behind the omnipresent melody, Kid Francescoli offers intimate lyrics in English and Italian, many dealing with young men's angst and the dreams of a girl at the dawn of her thirtieth birthday. The music, with its tenacious refrains and its heartfelt instrumentals, shows the inspiration of Air and Grandaddy. At the same time, Italian acts like Cinecitta Ennio Morricone's sound tracks are an obvious influence for this group from Marseilles.

After showing promise as a live act, especially during the Marsatac 2005 festival, the group launched their first national tour (Paris, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Rennes, Nice) in May 2006, sharing the stage with artists such Sebastien Schuller or Troy Von Balthazar. 

Kid Francescoli have just released their first album.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kid+Francescoli">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
