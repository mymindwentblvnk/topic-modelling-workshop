Norwegian Angry Brew was founded early 2005, and is the brainchild of Anders(Guitar) and Jörgen(ex-drummer of Tömmermenn).
To complete the lineup they were joined by Mathis and Nico(whom they later in 05' decided to part ways with) 

Musically the band is playing a blend of melodic, powerful and groovy metal based rock'n'roll. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Angry+Brew">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
