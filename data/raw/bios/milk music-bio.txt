Formed in Olympia, Washington, USA in 2008, Milk Music are a very loud four-piece who make cosmic, electric, soul rock on the subject of life and the human condition. Sonically, their songs have often been compared to those of the Wipers, Neil Young & Crazy Horse, Hüsker Dü, the Velvet Underground, the Gun Club, and the Meat Puppets. 

Ever since their eponymous 2009 demo tape, they've continued to self-release all of their vinyl records and cassettes simply for the sake of maintaining quality control, doing things on their own terms, and keeping the soul in the music.
