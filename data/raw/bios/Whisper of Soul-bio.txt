Whisper of Soul is a Melodic Black Metal band from Ukraine - formed in 2004. Of course being a more recent band, they have released two albums. Both of these albums include almost Gothic themes but, more in the Gothic "era". It includes dark and evil themes such as ghosts and vampires. The only differences between their 2006 full-length "Fear of Retaliation" and 2010 "Aria of Pain" is the second album has more Symphonic influences. 

The band was formed with two members; Vladimir Sheremeta and  Baranov Eugene. Their real idea was to take all of their ideas in music and render it into one Melodic style. Although, some of their rehearsals weren't ever released, they have been known to evolve styles for their four years of musicianship as an independent band.
