Black Moor plays pure, unapologetic heavy metal. Think bullet belts, air guitar solos, denim and leather and you're on the right track. Heavily inspired by many greats of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal as well as 80's thrash and some progressive rock, Black Moor's approach to making music has always been simply to play metal the way they've always loved to hear it. Never taking themselves too seriously, the boys bring a sense of fun and an explosive live show to the stage which has made them one of the premiere metal acts on the Canadian East Coast.

A near-fatal car accident in June of 2008 nearly cut the bandâ€™s career short, and the subsequent turmoil caused disruptions through the end of 2008 and into the early parts of 2009. Emerging stronger than ever from this difficult time, Black Moor released their debut album, The Conquering, in August of 2009 on Halifax based indie label Diminished Fifth Records. The album was well received, earning the boys an award for "Loud Recording of the Year" at Molson Canadian Nova Scotia Music Week 2010 as well as nominations in 2 other categories, and a nomination in the Loud category at the East Coast Music Awards. The Conquering is currently available in stores across Canada, on iTunes and through various other online sources.

Black Moor is pleased to have shared the stage with artists such as Joey Belladonna of Anthrax, 3 Inches of Blood, Goat Whore, Priestess, Protest the Hero, Cancer Bats, Barn Burner, Baptized in Blood and many others.
