The quintet’s razor-sharp attack melds a traditional metal spirit with 21st century extremity to establish GRAVES OF VALOR as one of the most promising new death metal bands in years. As songs such as “Locusta”, “Pestilence”, and the title track prove, ‘Salarian Gate’ is a massive debut and one of the best death metal albums of 2009.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Graves+Of+Valor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
