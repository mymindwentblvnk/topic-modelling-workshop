Carnalation was formed in 2008 at Provinssirock in Sein√§joki. It was clear from the start, that the band wanted to make music that is straightforward and as brutal as possible. The self-titled first demo was recorded at the beginning of 2009. It received good reviews and earned Carnalation a significant amount of gigs, despite the young age of the band Doomsday Diaries is the latest EP from the band and it was recorded during May-June 2010. It combines elements from both grind core and death metal. The message of the EP is in brief: "If mankind continues on its current path, it will destroy itself and the world as well." This time the band wanted to pay extra attention to the lyrical message. Doomsday Diaries has been received well and as a proof of that Miasma- magazine wanted to make an article of Carnalation. (4/2010) At the moment Carnalation is stronger than ever during its brief history. The band is waiting eagerly to perform Doomsday diaries live. The battle rages on. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carnalation">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
