Uniting as one, Hamburg native Boys Noize and Paris' Mr Oizo join forces to form ‘Handbraekes’
  
Given that both artists have been pushing the boundaries of dance music in their respective careers to much critical and some commercial (remember Flat Eric?) acclaim, this new venture is a dream collaboration for devout electro-heads. Celebrated for the innovation in his eclectic remixes and heavy production style, Boys Noize has been clearing up awards in recent years - whilst since his initial mainstream exposure in 1999 Mr Oizo has shied away from the spotlight, courting a more niche audience with his experimentation in music and film with the Ed Banger crew.
