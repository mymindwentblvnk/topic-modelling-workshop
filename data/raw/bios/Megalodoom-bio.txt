Megalodoom took shape in 2012 in Nottigham, UK from guitarist & drummer Chris Marsland (ex-Bumsnogger, ex-Dead on a Rival, ex-Jesus of Spazzareth, ex-Year Of The Flood) and Barry Chadwick (ex-Dead on a Rival, ex-Year Of The Flood). Wanting to make music of a slower & heavier nature they approached bassist Tanya Byrne (Bismuth, Nadir, ex-Diet Pills), who had just moved to town, and the lineup was completed by bassist Phil Roberts (Death Tripper, Def Goldblum, ex-Blood Divided, ex-Huffin' Paint, ex-Year Of The Flood) making the switch to guitar. With no ready vocalists available to join the band, and no real desire to be just another growl & roar band, they decided to stick to the instrumental format and let the music speak for itself.

The first EP Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Grief was recorded in January 2013 and later released online via Bandcamp and a limited cassette edition through Dutch label Tartarus Records.

In April 2014 their album Tectonic Oblivion was released through Witch Hunter Records and available through Bandcamp. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Megalodoom">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
