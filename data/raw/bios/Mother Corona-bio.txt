They were joined by bass player Robert Glen that following summer.The band released its self titled debut ep on their own button mushroom label in the summer of 2010 to positive reviews from local rock press, the band also started to gig locally and make them selves a name on the local underground rock scene sharing stages with bands like desert storm, k-lacura, undersmile and many other local names.
