Matronarch is a heavy metal band from Adelaide, South Australia. Formed in 2009, they have been performing live shows for several years, sharing the stage with international bands Alestorm (SCT) and Megahera (ITA) as well as national acts Lord (NSW) and Rampage (VIC). Matronarch has also performed with several high-profile local Adelaide bands including Alkira, Arcadia, Octanic, Raven Black Night and Skintilla.

Matronarch's sound is best described as a mix of traditional and modern metal styles, incorporating melodic-death, power and progressive metal elements. Their songs employ a high level of musicianship, as they include fast-paced drums and guitar riffs, virtuoso-style instrumental solos, and high-range vocals.

A full-length debut album is in the works, possibly being recorded in mid 2013 and released soon after. Matronarch has plans to tour nationally in support of their album, and will then be setting their sights for the rest of the world! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Matronarch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
