Breamgod was founded back in 1997 when lifetime friends Jussi, Ville, Lauri and Rami, decided to put up a real hardcore band instead of playing punk rock. Their music evolved quickly from that old schoolish stuff to this metal influenced moshable brutality with lyrics straight outta man's heart. In the year 2000 the band had their first - and so far the only one - change in line-up when Rami switched from bass to guitar. So they needed a new bass player and Lapa was the first candidate. Things went right immediately between the band and the new guy. That was the beginning of a new era and Breamgod started their lethal march as a five-piece hardcore tank.

Despite of their young age, Breamgod is one of the oldest hardcore bands in Finland still active and there's no end in sight. The band earned their solid ground in finnish hardcore elite with their attitude of never giving up compared with hard and honest work. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Breamgod">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
