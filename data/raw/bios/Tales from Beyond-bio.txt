Tales From Beyond came into life due to the suspension of another band, Jane Dark. In 2011 Arpad Deak contacted Sebastian Nikolić with an offer which was playing bass in Jane Dark. Sebastian accepted despite the fact that till then he has only been playing guitar. A few months later the other founding member of Jane Dark announced that he doesn’t have time to work with the band. Despite all that Arpad and Sebastian decided to continue their joint work and launched their new project at the end of 2011. Over the past decade Arpad has gathered an impressive amount of unfinished tracks and riffs, which build the musical foundation of Tales From Beyond. Due to the long time period, a variety of different metal genres can be identified in the songs. Tales From Beyond’s style is best described as death metal, with thrash, black and ambient influences. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tales+From+Beyond">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
