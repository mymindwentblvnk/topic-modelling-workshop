Knock ‘Em Dead started early 2005, with drive and passion. “We wanted to bring true back into the heavy music scene”. Hamlet and Vladmir joined forces with Gus, Aric and Matt to write a heavy and fast album with inspirational lyrics. The music is in your face and it’s meant to wake you up and get your life back on track. Also, to know that there is pain in this world.

“Endless Struggle” is Knock ‘Em Dead’s long awaited debut album. The album is complete from top to bottomm from the lyrics to the music. “We wanted to write something original, but keep the Miami flavor. We were really inspired by Sepultura, Slayer, All Out War, 100 Demons, Napalm Death, and last but not least Rage Against The Machine. To some people, the lyrics will hit right at home, to others, the fast and heavy music is something they can relate to. The album is called Endless Struggle because we believe we will never stop struggling!” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Knock+%27Em+Dead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
