Frankie Bones (real name Frank Mitchell) is an American techno and house music disc jockey from New York City. He is best known for bringing the rave culture to the United States after playing at a hangar party in the UK during 1989.

He got his first inspiration from his father's vast record collection after his father was murdered. Later on, after he had started producing records, he was offered a gig to play for 5,000 people in England on the strength of his compositions. As the event started on 26 August 1989, the projected attendance had gone through the roof and Frankie played for 25,000 people as the sun came up. Being profoundly moved by the experience, he brought it back to Brooklyn with his series of "Storm Raves".

At one of these parties, a fight broke out and Frankie got on a speaker, screaming at the fighters "If you don't start showing some peace, love, and unity, I'll break your fucking faces". With the subsequent discussion of this event on the Usenet newsgroup alt.rave, Respect was added to the three virtues Frankie was speaking of, creating the hippie-esque raver credo of PLUR: Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect.

His brother, Adam X, is a well-known techno DJ and producer. Frankie Bones, Adam X, Heather Heart and others are associated with the record label Sonic Groove. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Frankie+Bones">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
