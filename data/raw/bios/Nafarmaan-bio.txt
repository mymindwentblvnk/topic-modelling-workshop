Bestial black/death metal from Bangladesh.

Nafarmaan, from the lands of the mighty Bengal, formed in 2008, is a Black/Death Metal band. The detested ones, the Nafarmaans each united by common hatred for the sacred entity, bound to obliterate all who dare to stand against their ideologies; which as the name suggests is anti-religious.

Vowing to not spare believers of any religion, for all is the same; hence are guilty of the same crime.

Lyrically the band never intends on exhorting anything but that which is deemed as the exact representation of their hatred for the very foundations of all so-called established religions which are a direct translation of the name of the band Nafarmaan, the blasphemer, the disobedient. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nafarmaan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
