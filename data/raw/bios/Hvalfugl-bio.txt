Danish folk trio revives and reinvents the Scandinavian folk music tradition as it is mixed with the modern Nordic jazz sound. These three young Danish musicians will blow you away with their intimate and delicate compositions played with such devotion that the listeners can’t help getting sucked into their profound universe.

With piano/harmonium, upright bass and electric guitar, you have a unique setup whether you call yourself a folk or a jazz band. This uncommon band structure is part of what gives Hvalfugl their unique sound. Without drums and with the possibility of applying effects, the music is a lot mellower than regular folk bands. This uniqueness has drawn Hvalfugl to a national following and recognition in their 3 years of existence. In 2016 they were nominated “Talent of the Year”, and in 2017 they were chosen for a promotion program by the major Danish folk/world associations. Hvalfugl’s debut album By, was released in the summer of 2017 and received great recognition by blogs in Denmark, England and Sweden. Later that year they produced 4 new music videos which was released with intervals of one month, starting in December 2017. The videos was recorded over the span of one day, and represents morning, midday and evening respectively. The title of the project is “En Dag I Oktober” (A Day In October). In 2019 they released their newest full-length album "Som En Fald Faldskærm" which received great attention from the danish press and national radio.
