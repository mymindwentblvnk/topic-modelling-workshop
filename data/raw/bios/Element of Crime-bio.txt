Element of Crime was founded 1985 in West-Berlin, Germany by Sven Regener, Jakob Ilja Friderichs, Paul Lukas, Jürgen Fabritius and Uwe Bauer. After 4 recordings in English, Sven Regener decided to write all his lyrics in German. Their first German song Der Mann vom Gericht however appeared on their album The Ballad of Jimmy & Johnny (1989). After Damals Hinterm Mond was released in 1991, the band has gotten more and more known, but still remained underground. Between 1996 and 2002 Christian Hartje played the bass. Sven Regener wrote three remarkable books ("Herr Lehmann", 2001 - filmed in 2003 / "Neue Vahr Süd", 2004 / "Der kleine Bruder", 2008), and as a consequence their latest album Mittelpunkt der Welt (2005) has become their biggest success so far. Today, the core of the band consists of Sven Regener, Jakob Ilja Friderichs, David Young and Richard Pappik.
