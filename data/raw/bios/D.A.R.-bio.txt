D.A.R. was founded in autumn 1997 by Audrius and Dovaras. Band members came and went as the years of searching for distinctive style and sound passed by. In spring 2003, young shredder Kostas (ex-Night, Stranger Aeons, SBS, Wake Up) and drummer Artūras joined the band. This line-up played a few gigs, among which the most significant is opening for CANNIBAL CORPSE.
In 2004, D.A.R. self-released a demo titled “Demoražas“ (“Demorage”), followed by a live CD “Metalinis griausmas “(“Metal Thunder”, 2005).
Drummer Artūras was replaced by GROL skin-beater Mangis in 2005. In 2006, D.A.R. played a number of gigs in Lithuania, and opened for death metal legends NILE and grinders NAPALM DEATH.
In 2007, D.A.R. celebrated their 10th anniversary by playing some gigs in Vilnius and band’s native Panevėžys. However, soon after the anniversary shows, drummer Mangis left the band, leaving it in lethargic sleep till 2009.
