Rose Ave. A country-kissed, indie folk collaboration between singer, songwriter, and actress Alecia Beth Moore, better known by the exclamation point-adorned, rose-tinted stage name P!nk, and Canadian singer/songwriter Dallas Green, who records under the moniker City and Colour, You+Me marries the evocative pastoral northern folk of Fleet Foxes to the soulful, deep south ache of The Civil Wars. Formed in 2014, the duo issued their first single, "You and Me," that September before dropping their RCA-issued debut long-player, Rose Ave., a month later. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/You%252BMe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
