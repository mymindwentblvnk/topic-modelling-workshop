3. A pop / soul artist. She has written a single on the Girlfight soundtrack which was produced by Dallas Austin and co-written by Queen Latifah. During this time she wrote with other producers such as Teddy Riley and Pharell of The Neptunes, had placements on the TV shows Freaky Links and Cupid, and performed on Soul Train, BET Live and The Late Late Show.

During that time she found out that being signed to a major label limited her creative freedom. After leaving Capitol she spent a year living and performing in London with Escence. They started making experimental electronic music together. 
Later she attended L.A.C.C to further her study of music theory and piano. This inspired Cole to produce a new body of music called Sexmobile.
