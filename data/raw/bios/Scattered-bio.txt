There is a minimum of six artists known as  Scattered, probably more:

1. Scattered is a band that is functioning in Macedonia, near Ohrid lake. The metal path, experienced, filtered and judged through the members of the band show up in songs, typically labeled as heavy, progressive and thrash. 
A high geo-dispersion of the members during the year isn’t enough of an obstacle, since gatherings occur enough frequent to exchange and progress ideas which grow into songs. Musical progression in songs is coming natural to all band members, who experience the songs themselves in the same dynamic manner.
But are the ideas and the way of songs effective, You be the judge of that.

Scattered members are:
Pece Klechkaroski – vocals
Micho Pavleski – lead guitars
Jordan Malenko – drums
Milosh Jovanovic – guitars
Vlatko Krstevski – bass guitars
