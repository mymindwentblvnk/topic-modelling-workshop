Dead Man’s Root are a metal band from London who formed in 2005, made up of brothers Ben and Alex de la Cour from New York City (guitar/vocals and drums respectively) and Yanni Georgiou (bass).

Although barely in their twenties, they exhibit an innovative approach to heavy music and have been surprisingly prolific, recording several demos before releasing their debut album “Mouth Breather” on their own label Teratorn Records, and playing constantly all over the country.

The band already has two self-booked national tours under their belts, the second of which was a 26-date tour in support of their album, and are in the process of planning an upcoming tour of the U.S. West Coast in May/June. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+Man%27s+Root">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
