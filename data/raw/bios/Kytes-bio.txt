This highly energetic band comes from Bavaria, but from its world-rooted metropolis Munich. Kytes is mixing fresh electro funk with daring modern rock. The result is pretty catchy, cheerful and intelligent too. The four friends even made it to a Vodafone campaign, often a ticket to greater things, as we know.

For now they have released the stunning EP "On The Run". At times the five songs sound like the sophisticated rock of French band Phoenix, but also convert into the snappy rhythm of the British ska tradition. Each member exercised a lot while still teaming up their first band Blind Freddy, which became Kytes in the meantime. Semi-Australian drummer Timothy Lush provides their English lyrics, singer Michael Spieler interprets them like never having done anything else before. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kytes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
