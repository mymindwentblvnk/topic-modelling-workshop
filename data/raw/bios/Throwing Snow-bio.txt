London based migrant Ross Tones makes music under the ever so pertinent moniker Throwing Snow. Drawing influences from a vast array of genres encompassing dubstep, UK funky, house and post-rock, his productions have a consistent comforting warmth and glistening coldness. 

Following his compelling debut on Alex Nut’s Ho_Tep in late 2010 he has since been in hot demand for remixes reworking tracks from the likes of Gold Panda, Kidkanevil and Greymatter. Radio support from Gilles Peterson and Benji B followed with guest appearances on Sinden’s Kiss FM and Ministry of Sound. 2011 has seen Mr. Tones inaugurate two new labels, Left_Blank and Snow Fall, the latter releasing his own acclaimed Un Vingt / Cronos Remixed. 

With remixes for Domino and Ninja Tune, releases on Raffertie’s Super imprint with hotly tipped vocalist PY, Jamie Russel’s Sneaker Social Club and a forthcoming 12” for Local Action; it appears that this hotly tipped producer will have little difficulty living up to the accompanying hype. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Throwing+Snow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
