Sens Unik is a hip hop group from Lausanne, Switzerland. They released their first Album Le VIÃ¨me Sens in 1991. In 1992 they released Les Portes Du Temps which featured some of the first Swiss Rap hits, like "Fiche", "Rira bien qui rira le dernier" and "A Gauche, A Droit".

In 1994, they released Chromatic which gained them a gold record in Switzerland and Sweden. The album featured rappers like Strike, MC Solaar, Erik Truffaz and Fabe. They had two hits, "Laisse Toi Aller" and "What I've Got".

They released Tribulations in 1996, which was recorded in New York and was mastered by Tim Latham. Pretty Boy Floyd, Snake Eyes of NY, plus Assassin from Paris appear on the album. The Sens Unik Tour followed the same year, with a concert at the Gurten Festival in Bern as a main act in front of 20,000 people. After this last tour, band member Rade left, but not without releasing tracks on their greatest hits album Panorama 1991-1997 which featured two tracks with Germany's major rap group Die Fantastischen Vier, one of which became a huge hit in Switzerland as well as in Germany. In 1998, they released Pole Position.

Dynamike, formerly of Silent Majority replaced Rade. Another tour was followed by a live album.

In 2002 Sens Unik released Abacadabra, an album that sought a larger audience, featuring Latino star Son Kalo. It incorporated influences from many styles and can be no longer termed rap music. It was followed in 2004 by Mea Culpa which was hailed as a return to the group's hip hop roots. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sens+Unik">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
