Created in January 2013, TIGERLEECH is the meeting of 4 experimented musicians coming from different bands. Gathered around the stoner style, the band produces a brutal, powerfull and dynamic music, a fat greasy sound inspired by Metal, Hard-Core and Seventies Heavy Rock, a kind of « Urban Stoner » !

Their first album "The Edge of the End" has been released on May 15th, 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tigerleech">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
