The Devil's Rejects refers to (at least) three different projects: 1) A Norwegian horror metal band. 2) Dorset based celtic-folk-punk group. 3) Can also be refered to the 2005 film sound track

1) The Devil's Rejects hails from Norway and was formed in 2015. Their style of music is a brutal mixture of old school metal, blending together thrash metal, black metal, doom metal, heavy metal and rock 'n roll to pure fury of all senses. With all their lyrics based on horror and exploitation movies, the band has simply called their genre for horror metal. The Devil's Rejects has just finished the demo called "The Blood Feast Demo Tape" and will soon get in the studio to record their debut album "Blood Feast". Be aware! This is music that will make your skin crawl!

2) The Devil's Rejects play Irish influenced folk pirate punk. The Devil's Rejects came about when a few guys and ladies got together to remake a folk band 'bus tours from hell' and wanted to add a punk edge giving the music a bit more balls. There has been a sucsessful restart and a load of cracking gigs so far and The Band are looking to expand into new territories in the near future.

3) The Devil's Rejects is a horror movie from director Rob Zombie and was made in 2005. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Devil%27s+Rejects">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
