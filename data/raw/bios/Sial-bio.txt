They hail from the paradoxically termed “utopian police state” of Singapore, they play a ferocious version of hardcore punk. Sonically unique in its own right they borrow heavily from the formula derived by UK bands like Disorder and then further perfected by Japanese noise merchants like Gai or Confuse backing up vocalist Siti’s vicious vocal attack.
Singing in the indigenous language of Singapore, Sial take an aggressive lyrical stance against the history and legacy of British colonization—the racist class structure which marginalizes the native population in the face of so-called progress towards the advancement of Singapore’s status as one of the economic “Asian Tigers.”
