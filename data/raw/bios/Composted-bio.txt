Composted is a death metal band from Massachusetts, USA, currently consisting of Evan Duplessis (Vocals, Sexcrement, Strappado (US), Terminally Your Aborted Ghost), Mark Richards (Guitar/Vocals, Sexcrement, Upon Crimson Wings, Strappado (US), Terminally Your Aborted Ghost),  Tim Chang (Bass), and Michael Butkiewicz (Drums, Noosebomb, Terminally Your Aborted Ghost, Bane of Existence).

Composted formed in June, 2007, as strictly a slam band, but in due time began mixing various styles while retaining as much groove and slam as possible without falling into the same patterns as most modern slam bands. They infuse elements of slam, traditional death metal and grindcore with slight tastes of black metal, crust, d-beat, etc., complemented by a thick coat of comedy and stupid stage antics.

In January, 2009, Composted teamed up with Cephalic Records (Czech Republic) to co-release the debut EP Sexual Transmission: Simplex Slam, featuring 6 tracks (one of which is a bonus track). The band is wrapping up 3 brand new songs for a 3-way split late summer 2010, followed by a full length entitled The American Wet Dream sometime in 2011.

DISCLAIMER: It is not Composted's purpose to sound like every other slam band emerging these days, so don't expect all guttural all the time and every riff to be a breakdown.
