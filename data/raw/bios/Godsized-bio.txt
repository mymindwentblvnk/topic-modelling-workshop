"Godsized have total commitment to their cause,with considerable substance and breadth. They sweat not so much bullets as tactical nuclear missles onstage – and they’re aiming firmly for major explosions. Godsized really do have what it takes to be the next British metal band to make an impact on a global scale."
Malcolm Dome - Metal Hammer.

Godsized are four like-minded musicians with one main ambition in mind – channelling everything they have into creating heavy, groove based hard rock culminating in powerful, dynamic live shows. 

Godsized solidified the bands’ line-up in 2008 and the band quickly established a name for themselves on the live circuit. 

In December 2008 the band Self-released 5 Track EP “Brothers in Arms” produced by former Kill 2 this guitarist Mark Mynett. 

Following on from this the band hit the road playing as much as possible including slots at the Hellfire festival 2009 at the Islington Acadamey, the Sophie Lancaster stage at Bloodstock 2009 & Hammerfest 2010 amongst many others.

The band are currently recording a new EP due for release in July 2010, which will be followed by the full length album in the winter of 2010 / early 2011.

The band have also been confirmed to open the Pepsi-Max stage at this year's Download festival on Saturday 12th June 2010. See you down the front!
