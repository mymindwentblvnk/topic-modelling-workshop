Future Pilot A.K.A. is the nom de plume of Glasgow indie musician Sushil K. Dade, a former member of The Soup Dragons, BMX Bandits and Telstar Ponies. Dade has released four albums under the Future Pilot name on a variety of record labels, including Stephen Pastel's Geographic and most recently, Creeping Bent. The Future Pilot project is particularly noted for its vast range of collaborators and guest contributions from figures as diverse as composer Phillip Glass and writer Alasdair Gray to Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, folk singer Karine Polwart, Can legend Damo Suzuki and fellow members of the Glasgow indie scene such as Stuart Murdoch and Teenage Fanclub.

Future Pilot's music blends classic Glasgow indie pop with Indian classical, dub and hip hop touches.

In 1997, Dade turned down the opportunity to work as Kylie Minogue's touring bassist. He currently works by day as a driving instructor and lives in the Glasgow suburb of Bearsden with his young family. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Future+Pilot+Aka">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
