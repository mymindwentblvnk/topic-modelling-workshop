Biography
Following two years in their Eastern Suburbs sound lab, Create|Destroy hatched onto the Melbourne live scene in February 2012. The band's intense performances left jaws on floors with their crushing blend of groove-laden metal that swills together progressive, thrash and death metal influences; creating a dynamic swarm set to command attention across Australia... and beyond.

Create|Destroy's debut album 'Organic Perception' delivers ferocious, technical groove with a unique and progressive feel. Amongst its domestic and international peers, the albumâ€™s production, songwriting and film score-esque presence aim to break new territory and defy 'trend' metal. In one word; unmissable.
