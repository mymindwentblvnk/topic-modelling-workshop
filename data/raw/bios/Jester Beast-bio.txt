Torino's JESTER BEAST formed in 1983, contributed a song to the killer Heavy Metal Made In Italy compilation two years later, then laid low for several years after the untimely death of their original guitarist. 1988 saw the drummer resurrect JESTER BEAST and dish out this raging four song demo before releasing an LP and EP in the early '90s, and members from NEGAZIONE, DECLINO, plus a host of other Italians passed through their ranks before calling it quits in the mid '90s. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jester+Beast">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
