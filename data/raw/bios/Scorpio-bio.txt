There are several Scorpios.

The most prominent one is a collaboration between Bristol drum n' bass producers Roni Size and DJ Die.

Another Scorpio is Panos Kanoutas, a Greek electronic producer from Corfu Island with a dark emotional electro techno style. While taking his piano lessons he was co-organizing and developing a unique experimental percussion project in Greece (rock bands, jazz, etc..)

Moving from Corfu to Athens to study Music Technology and Sound Engineering he meets Leon Segka from “Ntrop Recordings”, unleashing the first releases as Scorpio. After his debut album “Elektra’s Eyes” on Ntrop Recordings, Scorpio starts to release his music through international labels. After several singles and remixes, his latest singles “Computer Reality” and “Uninvited Visitor” give the stigma of Scorpio’s unique dark and emotional electro style.

Scorpio has been busy performing live in clubs and festivals all around Greece and abroad, Trend club (Berlin) and Nothing Hill Arts Club (London) to name a few. He has also appeared with great success in Synch Festival (the biggest festival in electronic music and digital arts in Greece), and also host’s shows at web radios all around the world (USA, Europe).

His live acts bring out dark atmospheres, presenting a unique electro style with live vocoder, laptop, synthesizers, electro strings, broken beats and techno grooves.

Black Montanas as a “single EP” will release Scorpio’s latest effort “Enemy Detector”. Including a special remix by the label owner Equitant.
