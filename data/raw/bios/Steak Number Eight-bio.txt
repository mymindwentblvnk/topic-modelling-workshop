Steak Number Eight is a post-hardcore/sludge band formed in Wevelgem, Belgium in 2005. Their current line-up consists of vocalist/guitarist Brent Vanneste, guitarist Cis Deman, bassist Jesse Surmont and Joris Casier on drums. They have three full length albums running: When The Candle Dies Out(2008), All Is Chaos(2011), which is produced by Matt Bayles (Isis, Neurosis,...) and The Hutch(2013), which is mastered by Howie Weinberg (Deftones, Faith No More, Pantera).

Heavily influenced - in a good way - by acts like Neurosis and the Neurot back-catalogue in its entirety is this young Belgian Rock Quartet. Became famous when winning Humo's Rock Rally, a Belgian competition who made other artists like dEUS, Balthazar, Goose... famous. Despite their young age (14-16 years old back then), their music sounds dark and heavy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Steak+Number+Eight">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
