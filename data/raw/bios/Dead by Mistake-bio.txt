In today’s music scene there's barely any room for new enthusiastic bands, and if you want a spot in the scenes corner u better be willing to work your ass off for it. Well, Dead by Mistake are somewhat of a different story. Not only are they working their asses of with non stop touring, relentless ambition, on stage energy and a passion for music, they are not satisfied with the scenes corner, no way, they are charging straight to the center to grab the spotlight that is so rightfully theirs.

Indeed, the band has a bright future ahead of them. Formed in the midst of the Croatian punk scene, where the likes of metal core and screamo bands where nowhere to be found, the band took the role of a catalyst who would introduce the scene to a unique sound that the local audience weren't familiar with, later to be known as one of the godfathers of mainstream metal core and screamo music in Croatia. The members spared no time and went head .. the compilation of their first EP entitled 'Kisses and Memories' taking on everything that came their way. They have grown a very steady fan base using online promotion sites such as Myspace, and by playing show, after show, after show to prove to their pears that they mean business. Riding the old continent like it was a hooker on speed, the band spent the last two years on the road, surprising and gaining new fans all over Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Switzerland..., playing shows with heavyweights such as Victory Records own SCARS OF TOMORROW and ON THE LAST DAY, and the rising metal stars THE CASINO BRAWL (members of the legendary THE HURT PROCESS), and they have no intent of stopping anytime soon.


On the music side the band constantly evolve, so besides metal and hardcore there’s also some alternative rock to be found in there, and that’s the combination that got the attention of labels, leading to a two song release on the mayor Croatian record label DALLAS records compilation 'New Underground' and a single on an independent U.K. label AFTER THE BLACKOUT records and the release of two videos for their singles 'We'll meet in the fable of our past lives' and 'Leo vs. Libra' which got rotation on local radio and TV stations as well as MTV ADRIA. To make everything more unbelievable, the band was featured in the praised U.S. reality show PROJECT MY WORLD that gained them a fan base over the big pond. Big things are to come for Dead By Mistake, and it's only a matter of time before these guys become huge.


''I think that our constant hard work on our music and the band, the constant touring, the sacrifices, the blood sweat and tears, the love we put in it, that’s what will separate us from the rest of the bands'' says Sasa Macek. Maybe you would say it s a trend, a passing phase in music but the guys are just doing what comes out of their harts, and isn't that what music is all about? "We like to think our songs have an edge to them that different band members produce when writing", says Goran Bistrovic. And it's the DBM sound you'll either hate or love.
