Metabolic is a 20 year old producer hailing from Manchester UK, his style and sounds can be described as machine gun drumming with a robotic chaos of bass. With every new song he brings something new and unexpected to the table.  His influences come from metal bands such as Pantera, Slipknot, Coal Chamber and Lamb Of God. Dubstep Influences include Excision, Tomba, Reso and downlink. If you a fan metal I defiantly recommend Metabolic, Bass and Metal have  never blended together better. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Metabolic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
