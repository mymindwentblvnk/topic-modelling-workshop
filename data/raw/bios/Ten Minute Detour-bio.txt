Meeting via Kijiji ads in Calgary Alberta, Ten Minute Detour released their debut full-length album, Lay it Down, in 2015. Highlights include Four Papers and Getaway, two catchy alternative rock tracks, which helped pave the road for the band, who have since played hundreds of shows across Canada. In the winter of 2017, Ten Minute Detour recorded their second album in Nashville TN, teaming up with producer and former Cage the Elephant guitarist, Lincoln Parish. Common Pleasure, whose seven tracks were recorded over a harrowing seven days, is a testament to the band’s maturation and growth in songwriting and storytelling, shedding the garage-rock skin and donning a more expansive, gripping sound. 2019 saw the relocation of TMD from their prairie home to Southern Ontario. A move focused on elevating the band through more extensive touring and exposure. Pause for one global pandemic… and Ten Minute Detour is ready to continue their journey where they left off. Their exciting new record, set for release Summer 2022, is an exploration into more powerful, thoughtful, and creative songwriting. Venturing further and further from their garage rock roots, the album breathes an Americana folk essence, while brandishing the energy of a band in full stride. In support of their new LP, TMD will once again take to the road in 2022, playing stages across Canada. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ten+Minute+Detour">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
