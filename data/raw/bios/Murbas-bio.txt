Heavy metal act from Japan, formed in 1980. Murbas released several demo tapes in the early 80's and eventually appeared with other bands like Sabbrabells and more on the vinyl compilation "All Night Metal Party '84 to '85", released in 1985. Murbas is the first Japanese band who used "Visual Violence" as motto, with random comments about sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. Following this tendency it's easy to deduce why this Japanese parallel of Glam got the name of Visual. A few years later X would follow the tradition with their mottoes "Sexy Scandal Love Violence" and "Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock". Murbas is probably best known for their song "Drivin' Wild". Currently spit-up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Murbas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
