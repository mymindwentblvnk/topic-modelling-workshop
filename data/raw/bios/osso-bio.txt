there are 2 bands with the name "Osso"

1. From Italy. A band formed by Eraldo Bernocchi and Morkobot
It was a dark and stormy night and that was how Eraldo Bernocchi and the brave and fearsome messengers of MoRkObOt decided to meet the next day. They met while eating, what else?
So it was inevitable that, in the throes of the extraordinary consequences of digestion, the four shady characters found themselves in a recording studio pouring their gastric juices on a guitar (which might sound like a bass), two bass guitars (which might sound like two guitars) a drum kit (which might sound like a pocket calculator) and a lot of newfangled electronic equipment (those might sound like a drum kit, or not) mixed together to form a mass of shapeless, slimy, creepy blob named Osso. Sludge that drips electronic that expels dub that crash grind that melt jelly neurons. Sound penetrates flesh. Die laughing, laugh dying.
