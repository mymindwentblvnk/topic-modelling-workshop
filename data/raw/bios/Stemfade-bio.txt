Stemfade was a melodic metalcore band from Pervouralsk, Russia (2006-2009). Starting with metalcore they came to a mix of metalcore and harsh heavy metal vocals by which they obtained their unique and recognizable sound. During almost 3 years of their existence, they recorded an EP and LP, both in home conditions. Stemfade shared the stage with many Russian metal bands, and also played with Heaven Shall Burn (Germany). Then half a year later after their LP came out, the band broke up due to their own reasons, saying that they were through with that style of music and wanted to try something else.
