The band's first line up, formed in the late 2008, goes straight to the point, publishing a first EP called "Rhyme2009", capturing eyes and ears of many rock radios all over Italy and USA, which begin to give airplay to the songs. Thanks to this EP, Rhyme started to get a name in the circuit of the most important underground rock clubs in the north of Italy. In 2010, Gabriele Gozzi joins the band.... Graduated with "the outstanding vocal student 2007" award at the prestigious Musicians Institute in Los Angeles, Gabriele adds experience to the band, having already collected many European and Italian tours over the years, supporting great rock acts during his carrier. Having consolidated the new line up,in June 2010, the band closes up in the studio to record the debut album named "fi(r)st", before flying to Los Angeles for the mixing and mastering process. Behind the mixing console is Fabrizio Grossi, already at work with Glenn Hughes, Steve Vai, Paul Stanley, Ice T, Slash among the others. The mastering was handled by mr.Tom Baker, of Papa Roach, Alter Bridge, Buckcherry, Wolfmother fame, in his Precision Mastering Studios in Hollywood (CA). The professional and yet fearless attitude of the band, combined with a bunch of killer songs, found the interests of Bagana Records, which takes the band under its wing and will release the debut album "fi(R)st" on Jan 28th 2011. The album is already available on iTUNES and on other main digital webstores through Sounday Music.
