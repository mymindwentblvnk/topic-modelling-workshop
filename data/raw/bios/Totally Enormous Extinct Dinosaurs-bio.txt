Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs is a pseudonym of Orlando Higginbottom (b. 7 Mar 1986 in Oxford, UK) and débuted with "All In One Sixty Dancehalls EP" (2009, Greco-Roman).

Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs swings between overt musicality and scarily on-point dance floor intuition, ripping up gigs around the globe with his live show of bizarre instruments, glitter cannons and of course… dancing dinosaurs. Having completed successful tours across America, Europe and a recent sold-out run of headline dates across the UK, as well as featuring at every notable summer festival for the past two years, TEED will release his début album this June 2012. 

His second EP, "All In Two Sixty Dancehalls EP" (2010, Greco-Roman), brought notoriety, in particular the lead track, Garden. 'Garden' was revisited last October via Polydor with support from Radio 1, both day and night, and a global sync for the Nokia Lumia ad campaign. It’s one of the most instantly recognizable electronic-pop records of recent years, having clocked up over 2.5million views on YouTube and counting.

Early releases from Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs have been compiled on two EP's - 'Prehistory I' and 'Prehistory II' (both 2011 , Greco-Roman).

TEED's long remix discography includes: Lady Gaga, Friendly Fires, Professor Green to name just a few. 

His biggest adventure to date took him to the Congo in Africa, working with local musicians as one of the personally invited producers to collaborate on Damon Albarn and Oxfam’s DRC LP project.

Debut album 'Trouble' is released on the 11th June 2012.
