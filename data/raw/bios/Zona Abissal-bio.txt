The band began on the mid-80's on the city of Salvador (Bahia), northeast of Brazil. In 1989 they put out their debut self-titled album that contained excellent heavy/power metal with lyrics in Portuguese. Then the band took a break. In 1993 they released in form of tape ``Kill and Die`` which obviously already had lyrics in English a sound bordering on thrash metal and was produced by Michael Hoffmann ex-Sodom. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zona+Abissal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
