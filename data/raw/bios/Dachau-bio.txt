There's at least two different bands with this name.
1) Ex-Yugoslavian thrash/heavy metal band
2.) Legendary finnish 80's punk band

1.) Dachau is one of the best underground ex-Yugoslavian thrash/heavy metal bands, hailing from the city of Banja Luka. They disbanded in the early 90's, just as the war started.

They managed to record several demos during their active time. The band was highly influenced by the thrash metal scene of the 80's and some more melodic heavy acts (Queensryche, Deep Purple etc.).

There has been some rumors about the reunion, but nothing is officially announced yet.

Last known line-up:
Samir - vocals
Corda - guitars
Zoka - bass guitars
Deni - drums
