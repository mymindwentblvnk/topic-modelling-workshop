The bastard spawn of Teloch (Nidingr, Mayhem), Espen T. Hangård (Altaar), Dan Lilker (Nuclear Assault, Brutal Truth, Nokturnal Hellstorm) and Andreas Jonsson (Tyrant) is the unholy supergroup Nunfuckritual, recorded one album to date, "In Bondage To The Serpent" is as evocative as it is tumultuous, much more cryptic and suffocating than the more straightforward acts the members of this cult are known for outside of NUNFUCKRITUAL. Recorded in both Norway and upstate New York, the album was produced by Teloch, mixed and mastered by Tom Kvålsvoll (DHG), and includes guest vocal contributions by Attila Csihar (Mayhem, Sunn O))), Aborym) and Ravn (1349). The cover art was to commissioned renowned artist Christian Sloan Hall (Slayer, Danzig, Marduk, King Diamond). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/NunFuckRitual">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
