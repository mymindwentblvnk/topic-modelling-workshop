1. Metal Band from Bucharest, Romania.
The band was formed in May 2007 by Bogdan (guitar) and Andreea (main vocals). In short time, after searching without any success, Raul (bass), Alex (drums) and Cristi (guitar) also became members. In February 2008 Cristi leaves the band and is replaced by Dan, being followed after a while by the leaving of Alex. With Paul’s help (drums, ex Neo) the bands manages to hold two concerts. During Autumn the band’s line-up changed again - Andreea and Raul were replaced by Cristina and F.V. (ex Neo), and also a new drummer, Alex, joined the band. In mid-December they recorded the first studio song („Trash my soul”). This song, along with two other, which will be recorded in the near future, will be part of the first official demo album released by the band.
