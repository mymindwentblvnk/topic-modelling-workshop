Started out in 2003 as pure grindcore with a couple of members of Abominat wanting to play something more simplistic and "in your face". Lurveknurven joined in on bass and vocals. 
After a couple of years, Lurveknurven quit the band, and Flesh Torment went on hiatus until 2010. This time as a mix between brutal grindcore and old school death metal.

Current lineup: 

Captain Carcass - Vox

Flesh Gordon - Drums, bass
