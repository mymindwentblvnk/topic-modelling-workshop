Winterus is a American black metal band, founded and based in Michigan, USA. The band was originally formed in December, 2009 under the name ‘The Ancient’ and quickly recorded and released a 5-song EP entitled A Frozen Path in May, 2010. Soon after, the EP caught the attention of Lifeforce Records and Winterus was signed to a multi-album deal. The Ancient's musical styled contained some deathcore influences, which were also dropped when the band changed their name.

The band cites Immortal, Enslaved, Wolves in the Throne Room, and In Flames as key influences to creating their chilling atmospheric sound and ominously heavy tone. Blue lights and mystic fog line the stage as the band performs their intense brand of metal at near trance-like precision. Radiating maturity, Winterus covers themes of brutal honesty, isolation, philosophy, and real human emotion.

With a new name and a new label to call home, Winterus looks to quickly create a name for themselves within the black metal and metal scenes while becoming a lasting presence for years to follow. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Winterus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
