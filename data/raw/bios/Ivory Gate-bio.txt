Czech metal band influenced by Stratovarius, Blind Guardian, Manowar ect., established in 1993 in Kadan as Fucktor. Due to the changing members was renamed to Mistic Fire and in spring of the ´98 finally to Ivory Gate. 
Leader of the group is Štěpán Langer, who writes both lyrics and music.
And after few years playing only an acoustic form of their songs the old-new drummer has fortunately joined the group again.
So if you´re interested you can visit their websites and then maybe also their live concert ;)
