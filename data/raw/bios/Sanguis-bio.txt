Sanguis was founded in 1999 by Aries (bass), Otwin (drums), Robert (guitar) and Wolf (voc). Already after two months Witchlord joined the band on the second guitar but only stayed in the band for two months and left the band with Wolf. There was no intention in the beginning to get a second guitarist but to get a new singer which was Zhorn at this time. With this line up the band recorded the demo "Mortal Art of Blood" at the end of 2000 which earned many good critics.
After a lot of concerts performed together with Zhorn he left the band right before the recordings of the band's debut "Chaosgate Guardians" which were about to come up in the middle of 2002. The album was sung by the session musician Storm.
With the new singer Umbra the band recorded the second full length "Infernum Infinitum" in the beginning of 2004.
So the new strike upon mankind will soon be unleashed !
