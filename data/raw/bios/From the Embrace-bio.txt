From the Embrace is a burning planet thrown out of orbit onto a collision course with heaven itself. Rising from the remnants of the former Death Metal capital of the world, Tampa, Florida, FTE plays a highly technical form of Progressive Death Metal that besets the listener and never relinquishes the nefarious assault. The band was formed in 2007 by brothers, Rory (Vocals and Guitar) and Devin Garcia (Drums), and J. T. Hosack (Guitar). With the addition of Nick Marrero’s harsh vocals in early 2009, FTE’s sound took on a more aggressive texture and the band began writing new material. Later that same year, FTE recorded their first EP, produced by Brian Elliot, at Mana Studios; the recording features a guest appearance by The Absence’s Patrick Pintavalle on the track Disease of Ignorance. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/From+The+Embrace">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
