Legion began its abhorrent campaign against mankind during unrestful year of 1998. The starting line-up featured members of Toronto's infamous Blowhard (RIP), the notorious Skew-G (RIP), and the delicious K.F.C. (RIP). Inevidably Legion has since gone through several member changes, and added a 666(dclxvi) to its name, but i shan't bore you with a long drawn out history lesson.

To date Legion has released: An EP: "Hell At Last", Two CD's: "Kiss the Goat" "Die Scheisse Christus", Two Split EP's: One with Sweden's dis fiends 'Bombstrike', the other with Toronto's black metal outfit Megiddo, and a split LP with Brazil's killer 'Sick Terror', In addition Legion has appeared on one or two compilations.
