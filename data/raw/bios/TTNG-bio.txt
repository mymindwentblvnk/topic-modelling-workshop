TTNG, previously known as This Town Needs Guns, are a small collection of human beings often seen upsetting the patrons of German discoth√®ques, with what can only be described as dancing. They consider themselves friends but are often referred to as a cult and sometimes even a 'band'. As part of their cult like tendencies, they ritualistically write musical compositions in order to please their spiritual leader Dr Kenneth Bobo. Although the identity of Dr Kenneth Bobo still remains a mystery, some have speculated that it is none other than the gallery's old grounds keeper Chris Baker - who's whereabouts is currently unknown.

Many of the past members of the group have mysteriously 'disappeared'.
Current know members are believed to be: 

Tim Collis 
Chris Collis
Henry Tremain
