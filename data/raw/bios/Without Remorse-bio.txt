Since early 2004, WITHOUT REMORSE has been dominating both the underground New York Hardcore and Death Metal scenes with unmatched intensity and a penchant for supreme violence. After releasing 2 demos in '05 and '06 and exstensive gigging on the East Coast,  Summer 2007 saw the release of their full-length debut record "EXECUTION STYLE" on New York's LAST RESORT RECORDS. Now October 2010 finds the band releasing their sophomore album "THE TRUTH HURTS" which was produced @ FULL FORCE STUDIOS by long-time producer Joe Cincotta (Suffocation, See You Next Tuesday, This Is Hell) as well as a successful coast-to-coast U.S. summer tour with WAKING THE CADAVER & CATALEPSY. The new album entitled "THE TRUTH HURTS", is available NOW through LASTRESORTENTERTAINMENT.COM
