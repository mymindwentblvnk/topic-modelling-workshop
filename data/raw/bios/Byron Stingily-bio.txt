Byron Stingily is a male African American House, Soul, Dance and R&B music singer-songwriter born in Chicago, Illinois.

He had several hits in the eighties through the mid nineties as the lead singer of house music group Ten City. As a solo artist he has had his biggest success on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, where he has hit #1 three times. In 1997 he spent a week in the top spot with Get Up (Everybody), produced by Zack Toms & Paul Simpson, then hit #1 again in 1998 with a remake of Sylvester's classic Hi-NRG song You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real), produced by Damien Mendis & Stuart Bradbury.

That's the Way Love Is, a #1 dance hit in 1989 for Ten City, brought him to #1 again in 1999 when he re-recorded it on his own. Many Ten City fans strongly disliked the darker, more abrasive version that hit in 1999. So, after a short hiatus, he returned to the warmer, funkier, soulful Garage/House sound that made Ten City such a success and a favourite since. Some of his recent singles have been released on the UK based record label, Defected Records among others. Stingily continues to record House music, contributing his tracks to the underground House & Dance music community.
