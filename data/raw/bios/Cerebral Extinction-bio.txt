ABOUT
Cerebral Extinction was born in March 2013 at the behest of Malshum and Shon to create a Death/Brutal Death Metal project valid and interesting.The drummer is taken from Dagon and in a short time are written pieces of 2013 Promo that was recorded in early August in the private study of Ciulaz minds of Synapses. After some vicissitudes the bass parts are recorded due to the large availability of Cadaveric Crematorium by Dave.With the upcoming release of the Promo the band focuses on writing new pieces and the first live events that await.The first concert takes place as a group opening the only Italian concert of the European tour of Katalepsy and Dave was officially presented as the new bassist for the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cerebral+Extinction">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
