The Gault was a band from San Francisco, United States. They played cold, western doom metal, somewhere between the introspective dramatic strings of Amber Asylum and the droning, epic black metal of Weakling.  The vocals are very reminiscent of the stylings of Ian Curtis (Joy Division) and Michael Gira (Swans).

The Gault is a dead band. Their only album, Even as All Before Us, was co-released on CD by Amortout productions (FR) and Flood the Earth Productions (US). The vinyl edition, which featured an altered track order, was released by VÃ¡n Records (DE). Despite being released in the mid-2000s, the album was evidently written and/or recorded in the late 1990s - the copyright date is listed as 1999.

Lineup:

Ed Kunakemakorn - vocals
John Gossard - guitar (vocalist of Weakling, guitarist of Asunder, now in Dispirit)
Sarah Weiner - drums (ex-Weakling, ex-Amber Asylum)
Lorraine Rath - bass, vocals (ex-Amber Asylum, now in Worm Ouroboros) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Gault">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
