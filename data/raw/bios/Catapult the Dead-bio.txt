Catapult The Dead is a superb Post-Metal Band for you all to check out. They have a free single to download from their BandCamp Page from their forthcoming debut album. Valencia is a 5 minute thrill ride into the darkest territories of the human psyche. It has a great experimental edge to it as well. All looking good for their forthcoming debut album. Check out the excellent video they currently have for Valencia. Dark, Creepy and very mysterious but altogether epic.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txbCqWq8VhE
