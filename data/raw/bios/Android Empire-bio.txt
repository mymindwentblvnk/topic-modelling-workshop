After the Berlin-based doomsters SHEPHERD had disbanded in 2004, two of the band members – guitarist Oliver Bojoski and drummer Tobias Engl – decided to continue with their musical trip. However, this time the two long-time partners in crime had a more extreme approach in mind that would take them beyond the doom and stoner horizon. 

During the months to follow, various musicians entered and left the picture until, in late 2006, guitarist and long-time acquaintance Martin Fischer joined the project to contribute his part to the quest for a more metallic and complex style. Eventually, this quest spanned almost a year of writing material and looking for the pieces that would fit into the unique sonic puzzle called ANDROID EMPIRE. 

By the end of 2007, the puzzle was complete when Dutch bass player Detmar Hess and vocalist Jaime Correa from Chile came to Berlin to look for a band that would satisfy their craving for music, finding in ANDROID EMPIRE the perfect place where sludge tunes, stoner heaviness, and traditional metal blend to produce the dark and powerful sound collage that can be witnessed on the band’s first 7-song demo CD.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ANDROID+EMPIRE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
