Nychts is an enigmatic black metal project from Switzerland.

The project’s music is characterized by a thick wall of sound and grandiose songwriting.
In addition to the genre’s regular instruments, a lot of uncommon ones are used, such as the balalaika, the Swiss horn, and the piano. Featuring long songs with complex but enthralling songwriting and rooted in depressive black metal and funeral doom, Nychts is musical jewelry, portraying astral projections and inducing out-of-space sensations. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nychts">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
