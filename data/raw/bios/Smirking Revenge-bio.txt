Smirking Revenge is an all-female death metal band,
Smirking Revenge was born in December 2012, when Joannie Gagnon (drum) and Roxane Labont√© (guitar) joined forces to create a death metal band. Charlottte Lemieux, an intense woman with a voice beyond the grave, joined them in January 2013. She was the perfect fit for the direction they wanted to go. One month later, Gabrielle Bordeleau, a bassist with many ''punky-rocky-classical-jazzy'' influences joined the trio to complete the line-up. Black and nu-metal are also in the girl's influences, the mixture of these styles giving an unique sound to the band.
They have released in November 2014 an EP entitled ''Mind Uploading'', having for central theme technology and its consequences. They view the endless possibilities, good or bad, that a more and more computerized world can bring into our lives.
In 2015, Charlotte left the band to focus on her own projects. She left the spot to Marie-Claude Gosselin, an incredible singer with a strong personality.
