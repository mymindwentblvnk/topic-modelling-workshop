Creepoid is another one of those buzz-worthy local bands crawling out from basements of homes/makeshift practice spaces/recording studios lately in Philly. On their debut EP Yellow Life Giver, they use a reel-to-reel tape machine circa ’56 to help document their evolution. Yes, they are another lo-fi act flooding the indie music landscape, but Creepoid’s raw, gritty production perfectly compliments these four eerily engaging tracks. They open the album with “Rotten Tooth” which is filled with the spirit of Kurt Cobain and that 90’s Grunge angst all heroined out. In “Pink Tag Sale”, you’ll experience a dreamy Left Coast vibe that feels like it was written around a campfire in the lonely desert night. It’s in that Mazzy Star vein that haunts our subconscious. You’ll also find Creepoid putting on their dreary Brit-pop/post punk masks in “See-Through” before closing with their experiment in minimalism “Magic Drum”. The four-song EP is a tease. You can’t help but wonder what these guys and gal have in store for us next. - Q.D. Tran
