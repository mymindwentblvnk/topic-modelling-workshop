A band from northern Spain (Gij√≥n, Asturias). "Post-pop" or "post-punk" would have been easy labels to define Manta Ray's sound, or to compare them with bands like Sonic Youth, Tortoise or The Ex. But their sound was (and still is when they play) personal, challenging, experimental, accesible to the average indie-pop listener and necessary to understand pop today. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Manta+Ray">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
