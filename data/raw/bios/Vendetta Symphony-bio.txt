Vendetta Symphony formed in western Sydney in mid-2006 around the members of previous local bands like Thoughts Of Yesterday, Postcode 2770, Dyasphere & Monkey Oath. Originally the band played their first show under the name My Life For Yours before deciding that the name didn't suit them. Playing a melodic metal with death and core influences, they released a six track demo early 2007. In mid 2008 Vendetta Symphony released their debut album titled Born In Hell independently.

Eidintas plays guitar for deathcore outfit Alice Through the Windshield Glass and Brimstore also sings for metal/punk/rock group Chair Like Issues. He left Vendetta Symphony in 2009.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vendetta+Symphony">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
