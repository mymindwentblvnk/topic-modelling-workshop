This is a bit from a review of the 2005 release "The Menace Within":
"EMANCER pepper it with -are you ready for this? – industrial flourishes, carnival breaks, the Mission Impossible theme as a riff, 60’s lounge, astral keyboards, robotic voices, Viking chants, prog rock, synth-pop, folk strains, cool jazz, hooks galore, symphonic interludes, spoken word and power metal" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Emancer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
