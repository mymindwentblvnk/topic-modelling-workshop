Pelle Saether former vocalist of Zeelion, Zello and Schizophrenic Circus and also producer/engineer for bands like Cryonic Temple, Axenstar, Steel Attack is now ready with a new band called GRAND DESIGN.

It all had started in 2006 as a project inspired by bands such as Europe, Scorpions and Def Leppard. The first thing after writing all songs was to get hold of a good drummer. Richard Holmgren – a very talented drummer and former member of “Vanessa - now playing in Wolf joined Saether. Guitarist Peter Ledin (ex Vanessa) was next – his style of playing is perfect for this project that now had turned into a band.

Peter understood quickly the vision of GRAND DESIGN, and after Fall 2006 songs like “Air it out”, “Love Sensation”, “Sad Sound of Goodbye” and “Sheik Iddup” had become reality. During Spring 2009 all bass was done by Anders Mood, a good friend and also a member of Wolf.

Dennis Vestman (ex Steelattack) performed some extra guitars and Saether himself took care of the vocals.

The singer/ producer comments he sound of GRAND DESIGN: “We wanted that Leppard sound to it. You know: 96 channels of choirs just running you over – and we nailed it!!! This album features a big 80's rock sound combined with great songs with BIG choirs.”

With songs like “Air it out” and “Love Sensation”, “Time Elevation” is gonna be a rock sensation. GRAND DESIGN will bring the rock of the 80's back into your players and to the big stages.  The newest album debuted in 2014 entitled  Thrill of the Night.
