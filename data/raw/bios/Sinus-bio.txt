Sinus' nipple's were formed from a ancient metal found in a crator south of the border. When the nipples were formed, his body was also form. After his body was formed, he was a empty shell. Wearing a "I Love Mexico Hat" and a pair of trousers fashioned from a dead snake and the dirty boot of a cow wrangler he stumbled into a HMV, and absorbed the urban section via his nipples. After that happened he was picked up the CIA, and was took to Area 51.

At Area 51 he was expiremented on and was giving a song to sample and early version of Fruity Loops that ran on MS-DOS. He created his very first beat, which stunned and amazed. Soon after this was discovered he was kidnapped by the English goverment and re-homed so that the CIA couldn't find him.

Today, Sinus isn't aware of his past however he is aware that his nipple's are made from metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sinus">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
