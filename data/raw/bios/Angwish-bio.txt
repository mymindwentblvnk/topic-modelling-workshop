Captivating audiences from Connecticut to Florida with charisma, passion and energy, Angwish emerges as the Carolinas' hottest alternative rock band. Their influences include Nirvana, The Pixies, The Beatles, REM, Local H, etc. However, the band's diverse musical tastes and background have enabled them to forge an unmistakably unique sound. 

Together, songwrite and front-man Bryan Bielanski (guitar, vocals), Rachael Malmberg (bass, vocals) and Paul Robinson (drums) create the band's contagious sound described by many (including their producer, Rob Tavaglione) as hook-oriented indie rock with tendencies towards power-pop, hard rock, punk and grunge.

Angwish is undeniably one of the most dedicated and determined bands to come out of the southeastern United States. They have many accomplishments under their belt including:

- A sponsorship from Sam Asm music store (a national chain) 
- Songs appearing in Austrian Red Bull advertisements 
- Signing with Charleston, SC based indie label, Street Records 
- Two full-length CD's engineered by Tracy Schroeder (Local H) 
- Two self-released EP's 
- Touring the east coast several times (Atlanta, Athens, Philadelphia, Nashville, Cleveland, Atlantic City, Pittsburgh, Hartford)

2004 saw the end of Street Records and in early 2006 the band self-released their latest EP, "All the Problems". Angwish has finished recording their third full length CD and are planning a US tour for fall 2007. They are searching for a label with like-minded artisitic sensibilities that shares their ambition and drive to succeed through hard work and relentless efforts.
