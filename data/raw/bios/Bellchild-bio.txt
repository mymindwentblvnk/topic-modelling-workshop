Bellchild was brought into the world by three musicians in the Rhine and Ruhr area. After a long journey of exposing the acoustic-synthetic soundscapes, well sheltered inside concrete walls, it's now time to get out.
​
The first proof of live was set with the composition Mojo, paired with its music video. The second single, Focus Pocus, followed just in time to the beginning of 2017. This tracks related video clip brought a first impression of the movers and shakers behind the project. The music of Bellchild is influenced by artists like Radiohead, Son Lux and Björk, to name a few. 
After the single release of Embrace the band took the chance to perform their music live on festivals like Open Source Festival, c/o Pop and Reeperbahn Festival for the first time. 

At this point the band is finishing up it's debut EP, to be released in 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bellchild">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
