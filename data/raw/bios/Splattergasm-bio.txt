Splattergasm was formed in 2008 with a mind to create a goregrind scene in Adelaide, South Australia. The original concept was inspired by Putrescence, Lord Gore, Anal Cunt, Exumed, Carcass, Bile and The Day Everything Became Nothing. Over time the band has musically evolved in a more death metal direction due to the songwriting of guitarist Ryanimator, whereas the music written by bassist Dr Abortus is more heavily influenced by punk, grindcore and thrash. Concussor provides fast percussion influenced by technical death metal and deathcore, as well as incorporating various other styles. Vocalist Dredknot has a distinctive style characterised by an emphasis on higher and mid-range vocals. His lyrics tend to be more sexually perverse and less gore-centric with a morbid sense of humour.

Other past and current goregrind and brutal death bands in Adelaide include Silovanje,  Sexual Intercorpse, Vernichten and Gorebottle.
