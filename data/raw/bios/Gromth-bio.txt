Gromth consist of members who have been in the metal scene for quite some years now. * Tjodalv (drums) - has handled the drums for big acts as Dimmu Borgir and Old Man's Child and still hammering in the bands Susperia and Black Comedy.
* Grimd (guitar, bass, keys) - has done different music projects through the years, released a few demos under the name Opera in the early 90`s with other well known artist as Fenriz (Darkthrone) and Sarke (Khold, Sarke, Tulus). Grimd are also handling the bass for the black metal band Khold. * Andre Aaslie (Keys) - has composed music since the nineties but for different reasons he hasn't released anything before. He has also been a journalist for Scream Magazine in Norway for a couple of decades, and been an eager festival traveler for years. * Ole (vocal) - a newcomer to the band situation, but his expressive and highly original vocal is the final piece of the puzzle. 

Gromth is a good combination of musicians who have handled different instruments and styles through the years and are now finally ready to show the world what Gromth is about. They have been working on "The Immortal" for two years and now when everything is set in stone, they feel that they have created an album that will stand out as a original masterpiece. The music makes the concept come to life the same way the concept makes the music come to life.
