History
Formed in 2008 Osaka 4-piece band "Shatter Silence"
Sound style that develops music that emphasizes the world view with strong drama nature. You can listen to melodic sounds as well as habits as well as aggressive riffs with outstanding sharpness.
In the first album "Opening Of The End" released in 10 years, it fully demonstrates its own view of the world, finished in high quality work with both songs and sounds.
In the 1st Single "New Age Catastrophe" released in August 2011, the dramatic sound is alive as well as the previous work. We have established a more refined originality.
In August 12, about 2 years from 1st Album, drummer Kanemoto Yasuo headed for official members, 2nd album "Glory Will Under The Sun" produced with the strongest formation in band history was announced. It is an ultra powerful content that showed overwhelming skill and sense in the song style combining brutal elements and melody elements.
November 15 New bassist Imamura Jun welcomed, 3rd album "Shatter Silence" announced.
