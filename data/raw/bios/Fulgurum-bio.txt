Fulgurum is a one - man band created by Krignord in the years 2007 and 2008. The accumulation of negative emotions triggered the first attempt to convert them into music. 
The need to oppose many aspects of human existence derived from everyday experiences has been the driving force of Fulgurum. Fulgurum is the glorification of the radical individualism, „free spirit“ devoid of pseudo-moral restrictions imposed by religion and society. 
  
The basic assumption of Black Metal is the objection towards material consumptive lifestyle promoted in many societies in which self-development has been rejected making room for the acceptance of human frailty that is excused by religious delusion and hypocrisy. 
  
Being a kind of an extreme art, Black Metal is therefore a natural means of expression of feelings, which have been translated into the music of Fulgurum. The music is the result of different styles, however, it still oscillates within the borders of its kind. The climate and the atmosphere of the tracks can be most accurately described as Atmospheric Black Metal. 
  
The musical inspirations such as Burzum,  Krohm, Ossadogva, Inferi , Drudkh , Judas Iscariot, TOBC ( and many others ), human attitudes, and historical events have had a huge impact of the form and content presented by Fulgurum. 
  
Probably in late 2010 Fulgurum‘s debut album entitled „In the Shadow of Death“ will be released. The album has been registered in 2009. It contains 6 compositions kept in a climate of Melancholic Atmospheric Black Metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fulgurum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
