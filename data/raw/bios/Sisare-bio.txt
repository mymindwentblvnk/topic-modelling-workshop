Sisare tells stories from other realities, offering imaginary voyages to alternative forms of life and taking deep journeys into a human mind while still trying to make a relation to our real world. If the world doesn't come to an end soon, Sisare will continue to play progressive metal music and tell stories as a quartet. And if the end comes, who will need quartets anymore?

If you need this quartet, you'd better have a table full of tea, coffee and cakes waiting for them since that is absolutely the best way to tempt these four men to pay a visit - or to play their music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sisare">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
