In this era of corruption, apathy, gluttony, and malice, the setting sun of mankind looms impending doom on the fate of humanity. From the subterfuge menacing with the writhe of a vehement reminder, Everything Falls Dark depicts the depravity of our world. A new harbinger of chaos to current fodder field of metal.

Everything Falls Dark's debut album "Prepare For The Worst" will be releasing winter 2011.

Everything Falls Dark's electrifying shows will be coming to a stage near you, check the band's Myspace, Twitter, Facebook, or Band Camp for show details.
