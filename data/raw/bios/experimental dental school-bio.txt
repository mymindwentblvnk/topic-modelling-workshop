thanks!! Jesse/XDS

The guitar bends to the breaking point. Drums pump. Drums crack. Synthesizer samples crisp & crackle.  One voice howls, the other coos. A sea of bass over a lake of pedals. Here is some really nerdy dirty Jazz punk. Hmm...or is it vintage garage pop? Psychedelic world music? Synth fractured dance beats? Pretty? Yes. Ugly? Yes.

Experimental Dental School is a duo living in Portland, Oregon.
