Taberah was born in mid 2005 in Hobart, Tasmania. They were fueled by a love for traditional metal...REAL metal, and set out to create just that.


Taberah spent months developing their style, practising hard and writing tunes, until they hit the Hobart metal scene in May, 2006, playing along side local legends MSI and Ice Eater and surprised the Hobart crowd with a tight performance accompanied by a tough sound.


Taberah have steadily been playing around the state of Tasmania playing along side bands such as LORD (formerly Dungeon), Zero Degrees Freedom, MSI, Hammerhead, Lady Crimson, Abacinate, Mephistopheles, Ice Eater, Separatist, Corpse Carving, Stroke Of Ace, Hannah, Space Raven, The Wizar'd, Shackles and others gaining respect and expanding there fanbase as they go.


In December 2006 Taberah released a demo entitled "EXORDIUM" which featured 9 tracks of power thrashing madness. 100 copies of the demo were made and all were sold within 3 weeks in Hobart alone.


This year Taberah plan to release a self titled EP which will be recorded around the middle of the year featuring new and old songs to expand further around Tasmania and Australias mainland.


2007 will see Taberah continue writing songs, playing shows and impressing audiences around Tasmania and will one day venture to the mainland and continue to grow into a metal machine that will become a force to be reckoned with in the future.
