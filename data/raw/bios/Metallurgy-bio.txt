Metallurgy is a melodic heavy metal band from Brisbane, Australia.

Metallurgy have a very unique sound which includes heavy, yet melodic and catchy guitar lines, twin guitar harmonies, virtuosic lead guitar, driving bass lines, arse kicking drumming with a heavy double kick influence, plenty of solos from all instruments, the occassional progressive twist and soaring melodic vocals.

The band cleverly blends elements from many different styles of music such as traditional heavy metal, hard rock, thrash, death metal, progressive rock and metal, neo-classical, power metal and blues.

Metallurgy's sound is often compared to the likes of Iron Maiden, Iced Earth, Black Sabbath, Megadeth, Dungeon, Helloween, Pantera, Symphony X, Blind Guardian, Guns n' Roses and Skid Row, amongst many others.

The earliest incarnation of the band was in the year 2000 by James Metallurgy (Lead guitar/Vocals) and Liam Guy (Drums), although it wasn't until 2003, which saw the arrival of the name Metallurgy, meaning 'the scientific study of metal'. The band started gigging that same year and in 2005 released a 2-song demo CD-R.
After numerous line-up changes, Metallurgy have now recruited Power Metal Sam on bass and Ian Hard (Born From the Ashes/ex Praetorian) as second guitarist, and this is the strongest and most tight-knit line-up the band has ever seen.
Metallurgy have shared the stage with many quality Aussie metal acts including Mortal Sin, Ink, Empyrean, The Butterfly Effect, Eyefear, Inane Eminence, Darker Half, Template, Jobson's Dreamkillers, and Dungeon (R.I.P.), to name just a few!

As of July 2008, Metallurgy has begun work on their debut full-length album.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Metallurgy">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
