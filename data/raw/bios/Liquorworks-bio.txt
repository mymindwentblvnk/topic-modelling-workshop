Liquorworks is a finnish progressive metal project consisting of two members: Kosti Aho on Guitars/Programming/Composing and Panu-Pekka Rauhala on Keyboards/Composing/Programming. The project is mostly instrumental and completely guitar-driven, with various layers of guitar melodies, similarly to CLOUDKICKER and CHIMP SPANNER. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Liquorworks">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
