Synthetic Epiphany is an English Producer living in Hereford. Initially producing Techno, he soon developed a love for the heavier sounds of Dubstep and Drum and Bass. Playing a variety of instruments, including the piano, guitar and harmonica instilled in him a love of melody, which he tries to fuse with the heavier end of the Dubstep spectrum. At the age of 16, he had already drummed up a cult following and played several local gigs, from which he enjoyed excellent reception. 

Through his loyal fans he has progressed in popularity as well as in integrity and prowess as a musician. He has now been signed with WYP Productions where he hopes to enjoy greater exposure and where his music will become available for public consumption. Marcus will continue to develop as a musician under the guidance of his fans and of his new label and it is the hope of his entire audience that he will soon become one of the bright new artists in the Dubstep and Drum and Bass communities.
