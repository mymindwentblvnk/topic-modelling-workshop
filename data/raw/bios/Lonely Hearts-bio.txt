The Lonely Hearts were one of Sydney's popular power pop bands of the eighties, originating in Sydney's outer west in 1979.

Originally a covers band playing ballsy renditions of songs like 'Sorry', 'I Need to Know', 'Turn Up Your Radio' and of course their trademark 'Spicks & Specks' they soon developed a large repertoire of catchy originals.

In late 1979 drummer Steve Brabeck resigned and Phil Edwards took his place. After breaking up in July 1981 three of the founding members, the Rooney brothers John & Michael and Tom Watson, reformed with drummer Greg Ohlback & Guilio Mariani in November 1981. By February 1982 Greg & Guilio had left and Phil Edwards returned to play drums. In March 1982 they recorded their first single which was released in July. The double A side single Don't Feel Safe/Last Kiss rapidly sold the 1,000 copies which were pressed. In September 1982 Down Around the Corner was released on the 2UW Homegrown album and in June 1983 this was followed up by another single Ambition backed with Tonight. Down Around the Corner was then released on a Waterfront Records promotional EP in late June 1983.

After several years of intense gigging the band broke up again in February 1984 leaving behind numerous demo tapes and other recordings which to date have not been released.

In 1989 the band reformed with Dale Steedman replacing an unavailable Michael Rooney on bass and Anthony Bautovich rejoining on 2nd guitar. They released The Spell backed with Last Chance on Regular Records and in 1994 the Lonely Hearts called it quits.
