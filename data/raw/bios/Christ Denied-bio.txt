Christ Denied is a brutal death metal band from Madrid, Spain. They formed in 1994 and released one album which then was never picked up by a major/indie label.  They disappeared for a bit, until an interview with David Nigger (guitars, bass, drum programming) confirmed the band was having difficulty with situations and has put a hold on this band for his and the other members side projects.  He left the band in 2001.  The band currently consists of David Rotten (vocals), Roger Infected (guitars, bass, drum programming, backing vocals), Roger P. (bass) and Fabio Ramirez (drums).  Eric Raya (drums) was only in the band from 2014-2016.  Christ Denied is currently signed to the Xtreem Music label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Christ+Denied">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
