“Spectrum of Death is considered the holy grail of many Thrashers”
Originally released on a small Mexican label in 1988, Morbid Saint's debut has been
reissued on the Grind Core label in 1992. Combining the vocal brutality and rawness of German and South American thrash bands such as early Sepultura, Sarcofago, Sodom and especially Kreator along with the musical complexity of the bay area American thrash scene, Spectrum of Death is the holy grail of many Thrashers.
Also helping its "Be all end all of thrash" image is that fact that it came out in 1992, the same year Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power debuted at #4 at the billboard 200, marking the demise of thrash and rise of groove and metalcore.
