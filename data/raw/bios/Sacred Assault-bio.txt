Another raw, broken, and militant black metal band about which noone seems to have any information.
From their label (Elephant Graveyard):
 "obviously driven yet crude and incompetent black metal styled scum-fuckery. blind, mindless warpunk reaching out to clobber anything it can touch. like a prostitute in corpse paint, hung upsidedown in a rain of urine for all to laugh at. sexually tainted and cruel." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sacred+Assault">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
