The train wreck began in late 2004 when four jerk offs from South Jersey got together to form a band. The title for their debut release, "You guys can't play here anymore", was earned for their GG Allin-esque stage performance and off stage antics.

Many drummers, many guitar players and even more narcotics later the line up is as follows: Shlak-vocals, dirt, violence; Drew-bass, cigarettes, slightly overweight; Justin-flying V, fattest, ex-con(current Solace member); Mike- drums, single wide trailor, fire; Rob-guitar, sleep, oldness(ex. Dropkick Murphys, Street Dogs, )

Described as 110% Ultra Violent, Grinding Death Rock and Roll, hailing from Atlantic City N.J. The only way to explain this band is to go see it for your self. Stripping go go nurses, alcohol and human abuse, blast beats and blood, Call the Paramedics has something for the entire family.

3 releases down(You guys can't play hear anymore EP, You better bring a helmet Full length, Gruesome stuff relish 7" split) and a fall 2009 full length scheduled.
Strap on that head gear, and grab you spoons and lighters, its time to rock. CTP is coming to a town near you. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Call+The+Paramedics">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
