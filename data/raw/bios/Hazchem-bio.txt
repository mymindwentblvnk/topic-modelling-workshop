In 1990 members of '70's UK underground legends The High Tide, Kingdom Come and Third Ear Band got together to make this album under the name Hazchem. As you would expect this is an eclectic and weird concoction with a spacey feel mixing the harder edges of progressive rock with the flowing eastern improvisation of The Third Ear band. Vocals are handled by female vocalist Sushi Krishnamurthi who also wrote some of the material. An interesting experiment. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hazchem">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
