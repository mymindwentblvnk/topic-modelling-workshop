Kraljevski Apartman is a Hard Rock / Heavy Metal band from Belgrade, Serbia, formed in 1995 by guitarist and songwriter Zoran Zdravković and singer Zoran "Lotke" Lalović.
Their music is inspired by 70`s and 80`s bands such as Deep Purple, Rainbow, Uriah Heep, Black Sabbath, Dio, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden etc.

In 2009, a video for the new song Pandora was recorded.
In April 2012, the band recorded two new songs, Magija ("Magic") dedicated to the late Ronnie James Dio, and Dodaj gas ("Pedal to the Metal") announcing the band's sixth studio album.
The album, entitled Igre bez pravila (Games without rules), produced by Lalović and released through Power Music in November 2012, featured two new members: Nebojša Maksimović (keyboards) and Vladimir Rajčić (bass guitar).
