Samuli Rimmi, the father and the mastermind behind Dreamferno founded the band somewhere circa year 2007. Samuli had a pristine idea about the band he was creating and so without hesitation he started assembling the group by asking his old band buddy Juha to join Dreamferno as a bassplayer and another old friend Teemu as a drummer. First Dreamferno demo songs were recorded at Samuli’s childhood friend, Joonas Marjo’s livingroom in the summer of ’08. Later Samuli asked Joonas to join the band as the second guitarist.

Dreamferno started recording their debut album in the fall of 2009 and not long after that Teemu’s path with Dreamferno parted because his other bands (Ruoska among others) and interests kept him busy. Before finding a successor to Teemu, Dreamferno had to rely on Heikki Malmberg’s (Diablo) services for the remaining drum tracks. In the last fourth of 2010, Dreamferno found their drummer… Antti.
Antti is another childhood friend of Samuli and Joonas, so the band began to feel like one big happy family gradually.

Dreamferno’s debut album recordings suffered various backfires and the intended release date got postponed several times because the band got hard time finding a suitable and able singer among their ranks. After long and grueling search they stumbled upon Enni, a gifted singer and music teacher who had just recently moved to band’s hometown Juva. Dreamferno started recording vocals with Enni immediately and the long anticipated debut album is due to release in the 2014! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dreamferno">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
