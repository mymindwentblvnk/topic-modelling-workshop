(1) RAZORS EDGE is a fast thrash/punk band from Osaka, Japan "Blitzkrieg Thrashers" Their hyper live performance and zeal for all things "party-down" has lured them a cultish following. This is all before mentioning the music. Beats faster than lightening, guitars louder than dynamite, a sound and style harder than cement yet catchier than the chorus of an 80's sitcom. THRASH'EM ALL!! and DRINK'EM ALL!!!!

(2)There is also an RAC band from England.

(3)A third Razor's Edge is an oldschool goa-trance project. 

(4)From Greece Death/Thrash/HC metal band Razor's Edge
