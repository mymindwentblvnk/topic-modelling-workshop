There is more than one artist named Witch Hazel.

1. Witch Hazel is a chicago-based trans*queer performance group. They are affiliated with Pedicure Records.


2. Formed in 2007.  From York, Pennsylvania.

Witch Hazel are astute acolytes of the ancient rites of Rock& Roll. Forsaking the current, mainstream techniques of overglossed production, autotune and puddle deep lyrical content. Witch Hazel instead chooses the left hand path. The lost arts of twin guitar harmonies, polyrhythmic fills and extended jams set the landscape for our proclamation; which embedded in our songs serve to convert,cleanse and save the listener from drowning in a sea of retarded bullshit.
