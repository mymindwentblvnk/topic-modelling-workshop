Marlon Roudette was born in London and is the son of Cameron McVey, a British music producer, and Vonnie Roudette, a designer and artist from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.  He's also the stepson of Neneh Cherry.  As a young child he moved with his mother and sister to St. Vincent, where he began his music career, and returned to London when he was 18. He was a member of R&B / Hip Hop act Mattafix.  The New Age Songfacts reports that their single "Big City Life" was an international hit topping the charts in Austria, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Poland and Switzerland. However the band lost their record deal and they were forced to break up meaning Roudette had to go solo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Marlon+Roudette">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
