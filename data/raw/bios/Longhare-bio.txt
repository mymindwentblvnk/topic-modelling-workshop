Longhare, a heavy rock quartet founded in Rijeka, Croatia, became official on 25th of December 2010 by a group of four enthusiasts, which included Mustač on bass, Plude on drums, Teo on vocals and Gojo on guitar. Through fluctuations heavy and frictious the band’s sound blended more and more, softening but at the same time getting heavier, in a way only afficionados can comprehend. The band solidified in 2016 and recorded their first semi-professional studio recording titled the_rug_party  after releasing three demos recorded live in the studio prior to that. (2014, 2014, 2015). With time, the band returned to the pre-Longhare, original trio form (previously named House Of The Devil) and since then released two more studio efforts titled Radio Rebelde! (2018) and NEXT STOP: Wonderland! (2019). In 2020 the band became a quartet again and released a fourth studio effort titled A Day In The Sun. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Longhare">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
