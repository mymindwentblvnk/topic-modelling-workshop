Thy Flesh was initially formed in 2004. The band released a demo titled "Concept for the Devil" which was accepted by fans and press as a unique piece of extreme metal. All 3 major UK magazines Terrorizer, Metal Hammer, Kerrang were writing about Thy Flesh during those first years.
After 2005 the band was disbanded and was re-formed in 2011 with only Thanos Conchis as a member of the original line-up. The new direction is Black Metal with a touch of insanity to keep the wolves at bay. The new line-up is : Thanos Conchis: drums. Cloven Hoof: guitars/vocals, Christine: bass. The debut album that is now being finalized is titled "Thymiama Mannan". We promote vandalism, philosophy, esotericism, decadence of the senses, and disorder. We'll be right with you. THY FLESH SPEAKS!
The debut album of Thy Flesh titled "Thymiama Mannan" will be released JANUARY 2014 by Odium records, Poland. (Black Altar, Crepusculum, Varathron, Ars Macabra, Thornspawn etc). www.odiumrex.com <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thy+Flesh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
