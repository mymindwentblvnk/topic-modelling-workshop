Rey & Kjavik is the brainchild of Magnús Rey and Ísak Kjavik.
Two guys from the middle of fuckin’ nowhere, which choose to stay anonymous. The secret of a fluke
brought this two individual underground producer together. If you catch these crazy guys live, they let you be
hooked on their musical dopeness.
Watch out for the Rey & Kjavik EP´s on Kindisch (sublabel of Get Physical) and Compost Black Label, both
out now. A Nu- Disco remix for Storms Time To Burn on Ministry Of Sound UK, a Soundealers Remix on
King Street Sounds (New York) and their famous edits for Gotye, Tyga & Yazoo. More EP´s out soon on
Compost Black Label and King Street Sounds.
Keep the music in fore. Home is where the heart is beating.
