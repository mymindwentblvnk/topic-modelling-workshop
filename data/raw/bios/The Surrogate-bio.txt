There are 2 Australian bands, past and present, known as The Surrogate:

1. Present:

The Surrogate first appeared live in July 07 with a unique sound, combing numerous progressing metal, hardcore, and rock elements. After a number of line-up changes, the band's first two releases (a split with Willows from Brisbane and a split with Melbourne's Worms Of The Earth) were recorded as a four piece. June 08 saw the band travel the country with Rosetta (USA) and play nine shows down the East Coast. Having since been reduced to a three piece and now a four piece again, The Surrogate have played with bands such as Pig Destroyer (USA), Monarch! (FRA) and La Dispute (USA).  Expect an EP and more touring to follow.
