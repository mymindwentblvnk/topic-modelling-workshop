$GREED$ (AKA: Simon Le Greed) is a Heavy Metal band originally formed by Robert Wright in 1992.
The guitarist and vocalist Robert Wright after leaving the band Malteze in early 1990 wrote a set of 8 songs and began the search for musicians for the project over a 2 year span while learning to sing while playing guitar. In early 1992, Dave Carruth joined the band after spending several years playing lead guitar for the metal band Bitch. Dori Chitayat (our first drummer) joined just after Dave and played for about a year until he made the decision to leave in favor of playing a more technical style of music. Jim Parris, our first bass player, quit a few months before Dori’s departure due to not being into the L.A. club scene. Scott Truelove (drummer) joined the band in early 1993 and picked up the songs right away.
When the band Dead Jester split up, Jerry Sandeen decided to fill in playing bass for Simon Le Greed in late 1993. Simon Le Greed played a large number of clubs in the Hollywood and L.A. area and recorded several multi-track demo tapes. With Robert getting side-tracked by work obligations, the band ran into trouble in mid-1994. Scott quit the band in late1994; the band got a new drummer a few months later, further changing by renaming itself GREED seeing as that is what most people called the band anyway, but had lost it’s drive by then and broke up in early 1996 due to Robert’s personal obligations and Jerry leaving the band.
Robert has continued to write, record, and distribute songs as $GREED$ (and his industrial/Electronic project Digital Pump) since 1999.
