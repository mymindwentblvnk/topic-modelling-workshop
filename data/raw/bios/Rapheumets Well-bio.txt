Epic death metal band from Hickory N.C. Our albums express fictional and non fictional tales of inter-dimensional wars, planetary conquering, and the emotional strife of immense endeavors in which our story characterizes, all reflected through cosmic, yet brutal, metal. 

Rapheumet's Well is a complex mix of classical orchestrations, cosmic synths, and brutal death/black metal, portraying the epics of parallel worlds.
