Things got started back in 2006 when four guys from Zagreb went to a rehearsal place to rock, down tuned their guitars, turned up the volume on their amps, unaware that they would soon become a band known as COJONES. By the end of 2007 Sonic Doom Records made its first release, a split album titled „Cojones & Umor split LP“. After the Mammoth March tour in 2008 Cojones started recording their first LP titled Sunrise which was released DIY again through Sonic Doom Records in 2009. These guys played numerous gigs throughout Europe where they shared the stage with many great bands and played at Stoned from the Underground festival 2012 in Erfurt. The new album is called BEND TO TRANSCEND and was finished and released completely DIY in the summer of 2012 as a vinyl only release and digital download, with all the merchandise surrounding the album handmade and printed by the band. 

With the album finished, the van full of equipment and a big box of merchandise, Cojones are once more ready to set sail on a fantastic voyage through the European deserts, mountains of the Alps, squat clubs, long nights, highway lane blues, vegan meals, smoke and no rearview mirrors, old and dear friends, kicker spielen, drinking beer, playing music every day and all that rock`n`roll madness. 

So where are they now? Don`t know... but the legend has it that if you listen real close (or just turn your Bandcamp player up a bit) you can still hear them playing some more...
