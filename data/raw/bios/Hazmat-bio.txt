Two bands share this name:

1) Industrial metal:
 HAZMAT is the solo project of Matt Collins, a founding member of "torture-tech" band Neuroplague who performed in and around New York in the late ninties, opening for bands like Rammstein, Hanzel und Gretyl, Android Lust, 16 Volt, Haloblack, and Terminal Sect. In the meantime, Matt has also worked as one half of the gothic, ethereal rock band Despirator and played guitar with Metropolis recording artist Porcupine Defense.

Hazmat is one part razor blade guitar, one part mechanical attack drums, and one part synthetic cyberpunk noise. Mix in a large vat of acid & bake at 1 million degrees for 6 seconds. Mmmm. Tasty.


2) Heavy metal:
Hazmat is a Traditional Metal band from Sydney Australia. Hazmat is Jay on lead vocals and guitar, Caine on drums and backing vocals, Duck on lead guitar and Stu on Bass and backing vocals.
Hazmat's foundation stretches all the way back to the nineties where Jay and Duck was one half of the much accomplished Aussie thrash metal band 'Neophobia'. Jay and Duck have now joined forces with old mates Stu and Caine to form Hazmat and re-ignite their love for thrash metal! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hazmat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
