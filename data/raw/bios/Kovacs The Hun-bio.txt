Nándor Kürtössy, the man behind “Kovacs The Hun” was born in Balassagyarmat, Hungaria, and now lives in Budapest. He is a prolific producer behind many projects like Savages, and Savages y Suefo. He is also the founder of his own Hungarian electronic music label, Mana Mana Records. His first release “Five Finger Discount” is considered by some as a classic of eastern European hip hop culture.

Kürtössy had classic musical education and played on trumpet for about seven years. Then he got his first computer and from that moment he was much more interested in making music with computers. His early demo tapes were inspired by the rave era and after the end of this period he opened up to other musical styles like jazz, funk, soul, and contemporary music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kovacs+The+Hun">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
