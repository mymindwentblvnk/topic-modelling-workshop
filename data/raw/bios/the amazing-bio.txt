There is more than one artist with this name, including: 
1) The Amazing is a Swedish indie rock band. 
2) The Amazing is French duo Brandy Volant and Fabrice Ligny. 

1) The Amazing is a Swedish indie rock band whose members include Reine Fiske, who plays with Dungen, and Christoffer Gunrup, who played in Granada and with Anna Järvinen.
The band is often called a "super group from Sweden", but the band members think this sounds too contrived; "The Amazing is a natural process, a force of nature". Labels notwithstanding, The Amazing are a collective composed of members who have played (or still play) for Dungen, Granada, Sagor & Swing, Anna Järvinen, Life on Earth! and Dreamboy. Their self-titled debut album, The Amazing,  is wide-ranging and spans everything from groovy electric folk rock, via psychedelic pop, to airy acoustic ballads. It was released in 2009, followed up by singles for the tracks Dragon and Deportation Day. Their latest EP Wait For A Light To Come was released in 2010.

2) The Amazing is French duo Brandy Volant and Fabrice Ligny.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Amazing">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
