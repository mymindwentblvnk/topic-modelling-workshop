Through The Eyes Of Carrion, formally started in 1998, was arranged and created by Kyle Brown. The line-up has changed from Kyle Brown, Zach Walizer, and Rene Gomez to Kyle Brown and Josh Lauscher. The addition of Cameron Nash on bass now completes the band to form the trio of well versed musicians/angry college students.

Through The Eyes Of Carrion has been said to sound like not one or even two bands. Described as torturous and hateful with an intellectual edge, TTEOC veers away from meaningless adolescent facets that infect their generations' musical credibility. The musical background ranges from acoustic/folk, rock, fuckin outlaw country, to gore-grind, thrash,and death. Through The Eyes Of Carrion forges a sound unique to the collective metal world. 

Through The Eyes Of Carrion have devestated crowds along the sides of Origin, Misery Index, Lecherous Nocturne, Embryonic Devourment, Wolves In The Throne Room, Incendiant, CAVE OF ROSES, LSOD, Valdur, Host, Acheronian Dirge, Abysmal Dawn and many others.

The summer '09 release entitled "Exoculation," new merch and possible touring to come soon.
