Harp-driven rock band Diving Station are a four piece that make a lot of noise. Influenced by bands such as Bon Iver and Dirty Projectors, they are known to captivate and engage audiences with their dream-like sound. The unique combination of vocals, delicate Cl√†rsach harp playing and sprawling guitar melodies front the ensemble's style. This is integrated with a driving yet melodic rhythm section.

Having supported the likes of Clock Opera and Bwani Junction, their debut EP, 'Alice', has been featured on BBC Introducing shows around the country and handpicked by legend Bob Harris to be played on BBC Radio 2.
