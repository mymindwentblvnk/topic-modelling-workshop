Reigning from Richmond, VA, Suzukiton creates an idiosyncratic, metallic meld of stoner, math, classic and progressive rock.  Guitarists Jon Ramsey and Todd Naumann, bassist William Rose, and drummer Bryan Cox (of Alabama Thunderpussy) recorded the band's first album Service Repair Handbook in early 2002.  

By the time it was released in July 2005, Ramsey and Cox had left the fold, with David Boyd stepping in on guitar, and Ben Tufts on drums - just in time to tour in support of the album.  After the tour, Tufts left, and Bryan Cox returned.  After some time of sporadic performance and songwriting, Suzukiton released their second,  eponymous album in 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Suzukiton">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
