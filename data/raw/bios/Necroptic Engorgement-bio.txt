Necroptic Engorgement is an unsigned band out of Orange County New York. The crew  got together as a full lineup in January of 2011 and broke out in Feburary of '11.
With a 5 song self-titled EP, available at shows, and a fast growing following, these guys are taking back the metal scene and giving it a rebirth of what it has been missing. Pure Brutal Adrenaline. They are currently in the studio throwing down and belting out crowd moving tunes. While they're not here to try and compete with anyone, they keep it real with death and grind and make friends along the way.
