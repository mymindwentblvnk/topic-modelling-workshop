Primal Rite was born after the premature demise of San Francisco's Scalped, but finds new life adding vocalist Lucy of Profile (React! Records) to an already well-respected lineup that features current and former members of Busted Outlook, Condition, Tony Molina Band, Face The Rail and many other Bay Area punk and hardcore groups. Primal Rite goes beyond any specific hardcore formula, injecting elements of blazing Japanese and Scandinavian hardcore punk, Cleveland-styled crunch and '80s crossover into their sound. Look for a self-recorded 7" single and LP recorded by Jack Shirley at the Atomic Garden (Deafheaven, Loma Prieta) soon after. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Primal+Rite">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
