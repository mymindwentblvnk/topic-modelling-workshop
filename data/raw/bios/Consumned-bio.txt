"Despite the demand for trends, Consumned is a band that plays what it wants to. Influenced by a little of everything, Consumned has refused to commit to a specific genre in order to sell records. For the most part, they write with music theory but on occasion find it effective to bend the rules...again for their pleasure. Maybe one day people will get it...if they don't...who gives a shit."
