William Singe is 1/5 of The Collective, an Australian boy band who were formed during the fourth season of The X Factor Australia in 2012 and finished in third place.

William Singe, aged 20, is from Forestville, New South Wales and is the rapper of The Collective. He previously auditioned for The X Factor in season three but only made it to the end of the bootcamp stage when Guy Sebastian sent him home. Singe auditioned for the fourth season singing Justin Bieber's "One Less Lonely Girl" and received positive comments from the judges. Melanie Brown felt that Singe was singing the song just to her, Guy Sebastian called his added rap in the song "crazy", and Ronan Keating said it was a great audition song. Prior to entering The X Factor, Singe worked as a bank teller at the Commonwealth Bank in Dee Why, New South Wales. He was a student at St Augustine's College in Brookvale, New South Wales. Singe cites his father, a singer-songwriter from New Zealand who plays guitar and bass, for his musical beginnings. He began recording music with his father as a child and previously held gigs with him at In Situ, a restaurant and bar in Manly, New South Wales.
