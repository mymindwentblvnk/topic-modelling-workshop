Dunderpatrullen is a crazy electronica group from Östersund, Sweden formed in 2007. Originally founded by Jim Lindgren, Magnus Lemon and Stefan Björn, the group now consists of Jim, Stefan, Patrik Andersson and Niklas Hillman. The usual music they offer are most often characterized by heavy bass and samples, ranging from Game Boy, Commodore 64 arpeggios to harmonica and banjodashing. Dunderpatrullen have played at clubs and festivals all around in Sweden from Hässleholm in the south to Skellefteå in the north, including Dreamhack, the world's largest computer festival.

In May 2010 the group's second album "Analoga steroider" (Analog Steroids) was released on iTunes, 7digital, CDON and Spotify among others.

One notable member that was part of the project between 2013 to 2017 was Erik Sjöstrand, aka Bossfight. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dunderpatrullen">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
