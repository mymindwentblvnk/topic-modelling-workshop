Chaosstar is a Slovenian classic metal band with two axes, a bass and a drum battery, complete with a psycho drummer. But they don’t play classic metal, their music could be perceived as experimental or dubbed progressive.

To members of Chaosstar, who came together in 2004, music is more than a hobby – it’s their way of life. JJ, Beast, Dare and Primoz have diverse musical influences that gave their music the depth and despise their broad background they like to do what they do best: heavy metal in every way. Their creation of music could be described as eveything goes, yet every little detail of the big picture is important and is there with a meaning.

Chaosstar spent four years perfecting their style and sound, altough they also managed to convince many listeners at their live shows. Be sure you do not miss what Chaosstar has to offer on their debut album Lifetime, scheduled for January 2009 release through On Parole Productions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chaosstar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
