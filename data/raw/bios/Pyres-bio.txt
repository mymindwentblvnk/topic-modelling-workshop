A punk/metal/sludge band from Toronto, Canada.

Have so far released one demo, in February of 2012.

Debut album "Year of Sleep" out in July 2013.

Steeped in the murky waters of sludge and hardcore Pyres forge a bastard marriage of rock and metal that blurs the disparate boundaries of extreme music. Impassioned vocals bellow indictments of our crumbling collective conscience, travelling over waves of ever-evolving riffs. Thick tones of dual guitars attack, while a pummelling and urgent rhythm section surges beneath.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pyres">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
