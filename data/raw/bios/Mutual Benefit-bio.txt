Mutual Benefit is a music project created by American singer-songwriter Jordan Lee. The assemblage consists of various musicians gathered by Lee and has no concrete band line-up. Contributions have been made by musicians Marc Merza, Jake Falby, Cory Siegler, Virginia de las Pozas, Julie Byrne, Cameron Potter, George Folickman, Dillon Zahner, Andrew Morehart, Katie Pierce, Bradley Will, and Samuel Yager. After several self-released EPs, the album Love's Crushing Diamond was released in 2013.

Mutual Benefit is the sound of everything making sense, if just for a second.  It is the magic of ordinary moments.  

It is sound created and/or tastefully re-created by Jordan Lee as well as an ever rotating cast of ruffians and ne'er-do-wells

Jordan is also proud owner of the tape label/collective kassette klub.
