Mar Malade are Alexander Hauer & Michèl M. Almeida. 

Alexander and Michèl wrote and recorded the songs for their debut-album wherever they felt at home. In the kitchen, on a farm or in an old children's room, where they found all sorts of dusty instruments - even “Bachflöten“ - they would use to fool around with. And before they could even think about it, »MAR MALADE« was there and really wants nothing else than to take everyone on a little trip to dream away.

All the instruments, all the sounds on the record were played, recorded and produced by just the two of them. 

Even the background noise of a bar in the Intro of »Marmalade« was created by their two voices and a table full of glasses and bottles. Every laughter, every argument, every entering-the-room you hear in these 23 seconds is one of them, pretending to be part of a little crowd awaiting some music to be gently played.

Just for the brass, they needed a little help from their friend CATT. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mar+Malade">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
