Originally from Durban, South Africa, Conan crossed paths with Andrew and Dallyn soon after his arrival in Canada. After attending their final years of school together, they all seemed to be on different paths until Conan decided to initiate play. He called the only bassist he knew in town, Andrew, and drummer Dallyn, who he had been playing with in the summers. These three friends got together in Dallyn’s basement for fun musical release, nothing serious. They soon realized that they more musical chemistry than they thought.

Formed in late November of 2012, Little India has accomplished quite a bit in their lifespan thus far. Their first show was January 2013 as an opening act. Before their set had even finished, the event promoter and the venue had booked them for two headlining shows in the months to come. They have since headlined many venues around local Vancouver and have shared stages that have belonged to acts such as Atlas Genius, The 1975, The Drums, Jets Overhead, and many more.

Their debut EP, “Up All Night” released November 19th 2013, was mixed by Michael Brauer (Coldplay, Rolling Stones, Atlas Genius, The Vaccines, and many more). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Little+India">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
