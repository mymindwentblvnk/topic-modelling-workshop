Toby Pazner, long time keyboard/vibe player on many Truth & Soul (record company) releases, has come into his own and delivered a sweet little 45 under the band name, The Olympians. The 45 represents Pazner's musical aesthetic and features El Michels Affair on horns and other members of the NY funk elite from bands such as The Dap Kings, Antibalas and Menahan Street Band. 

With a mixture of soulful sounds reminiscent of Isaac Hayes, Mickey and the Soul Generation, and Curtis Mayfield, The Olympians are well suited for a lazy Sunday, a trip to the beach or any pensive moment. Recorded in his bedroom on a Tascam 388, The Olympians give us that gritty yet sweet sound that can only from NY. Pazner has been hard at work cranking out a plethora of goodness and this is just a taste of what is coming from The Olympians.
