GARSTIG were founded in late 2003. In the following years the usual routine of practising, songwriting and gigging followed. Due to numerous line-up changes it is only as of now that we can present you our first official and professional studio recording, TYSK ARKAISK (german archaic). It contains five songs, four of which you can listen to via Myspace. Our music is about misery, despair and frustration. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Garstig">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
