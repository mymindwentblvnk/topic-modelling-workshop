Kyson is 25-year-old composer/producer/electronic musician Jian Kellet Liew. The Adelaide-born, Berlin-based artist sees music as the platform through which he feels most comfortable - projecting his imagination through musical narratives; embracing and documenting the images and sounds of the world heâ€™s traveled - from the chaos and cacophony of bustling cities, to the peaceful, sun-drenched comfort of his own hometown. 

"Distance between friends, family and loved-ones; images viewed through the lens of an old camera; the sound of a bargain bin record bought in some far-flung corner of our ever-shrinking globe. These are Kyson's inspirations, his motivation, and the filter through which his music should be heard.

Experimenting with analog synthesizers and obscure percussion instruments helped Kyson create the melancholic atmosphere of "The Waters Way", the title of his new LP and first with Friends of Friends Music, due out September 24th - a reflection of his time living in the long and harsh European winter. The new Kyson Live show, debuting this Fall, is energetic as well as intricate. The three-piece setup incorporates live drums, Analog synthesizers, vocals and samplers. Accompanied by Scott Van Manen (Drums, Samplers) and Sam Rogers (Keys, Vocals)."  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kyson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
