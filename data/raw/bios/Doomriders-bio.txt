DOOMRIDERS are comprised of a stellar lineup featuring Nate Newton (Converge, Old Man Gloom), along with longtime friends Jebb Riley (There Were Wires, Disappearer), Chris Pupecki (Cast Iron Hike), and JR Conners (Cave In). The demon child of their collective unhealthy obsession with Classic Rock, Hardcore, and Skateboarding, DOOMRIDERS are a rare beast in today's music world. Their soulful no frills approach conjures the spirits of Thin Lizzy, Entombed, and damn near every evil in between. Making DOOMRIDERS approach one Hell of a rebellious and exciting musical ride.

DOOMRIDERS "Black Thunder", was recorded and engineered by Kurt Ballou (Converge) @ Godcity Studios. Recorded primarily in a live setting, "Black Thunder" is a collection of thirteen unbridled songs filled with spontaneity and vigor. From the infectious hook of the title track, to the soul wrenching track "Voice of Fire", "Black Thunder" is as eclectic of an album as they come. Paying homage to their collective musical heroes, while boldly serving as a monster of an introduction to the independent music community worldwide.
