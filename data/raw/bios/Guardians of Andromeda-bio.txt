In the deepest mists of time, In the most distant recesses of the ether, the brightest star of the astral realms fell.... into shadow.The ancient kingdoms of Andromeda, Once proud nations of a peaceful civilisation, slowly crumbled against the creeping tide of a dark age. It was though the sun had set for the last time, on this once beautiful land. Many resisted the falling darkness but only to die in vain, or worse, become slaves to its will. The long years passed, and hope diminished. Few could recall the glory of their kingdoms now stained with the blood of their fallen kin. But it was in this time, with the coming together of the twin moons, that the prophets bestowed upon the people a new hope. A vision, five warriors sent from the furthest corners of the great kingdoms would unite in this dark hour. Their quest, to challenge the dark forces reign and restore peace and beauty to the now ravaged land. Heed our words brothers and sisters! For the glory and honour of those fallen before With Andromeda’s spirit, immortal and pure Through the power of metal whose strength knows no end The guardians will forever……..our kingdom defend. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Guardians+Of+Andromeda">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
