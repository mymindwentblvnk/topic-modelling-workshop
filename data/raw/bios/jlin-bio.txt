Jerrilynn Patton, also known as Jlin, is the most prominent female juke/footwork music producer of this current generation. Originally from Decatur, Georgia, she grew up and still resides in Gary, Indiana, 20 miles from downtown Chicago. Though previously having used samples in her work, she now refuses to and her tracks are comprised of all her own original material, with influences from IDM.

In March 2015 she released her debut album Dark Energy on Planet Mu. It received critical acclaim, and was named the best album of 2015 by The Wire and The Quietus. Her second studio record, Black Origami was released in May 2017 and featured collaborations with William Basinski and Holly Herndon among others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jlin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
