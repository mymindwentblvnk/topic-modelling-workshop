Taking their cues from 80's thrash and hardcore happenings, Join The Amish are bringing back crossover with a spin.

Dragging thrash into our current consciousness letting those old enough reminisce the glory days when scenes were separate and to blend styles was an extreme statement of intent and show those who are too young to remember that sense of pure hardcore fun that has been missing in a lot of music since.

Featuring members of Mid Youth Crisis, The Abandonment, Embodied and A Process Of, they are not new to the Australian heavy music scene. Join The Amish may have a name that sounds like a piss take, but thereâ€™s nothing laughable about their fast and aggressive brand of crossover thrash metal.
