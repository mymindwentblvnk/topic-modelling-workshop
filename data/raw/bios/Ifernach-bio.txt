Ifernach is a one-man black metal project by Finian Patraic, whose roots lie in both the native MiêžŒkmaq peoples of the Canadian First Nations and Irish immigrants. Ifernach's lyrics are conveyed in French due to his strong connections with the Quebec metal scene. They describe Native American folklore, Quebec history, and similar topics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ifernach">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
