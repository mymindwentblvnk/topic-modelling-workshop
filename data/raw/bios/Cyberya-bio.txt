Cyberya is generated, by divine intervention, of the guitarmen Oliver Lux and Mathias Freyth. After a few months Paul Dahlmann and Robert Schomaker get into the project.

A band emerges, being different from other bands Cyberya became very popular, not only in the local scene, but even in the cities around Wuppertal so it seems to be necessary to record a Demo-CD, followed by more concerts all over the “Ruhrpott”.

Born, that's the title of the maxi, recorded and engineered by Peter Dirkschneider, Born gives a good imagination of how Cyberya is kicking ass. Melody connected with raw power are the ingredients for the trinity sound, so that Born is reviewed very positive in all German fanzines. Shortly after the release of Born Manuela Manzek gets into the band to play the keyboards. ...and then, the harvest: a lot of concerts all over Germany, where the band earned many positive reactions for their live-performances.

In November 1999 Cyberya released the new MCD, a second time engineered by Peter Dirkschneider and mixed by Stefan Kaufmann (U.D.O., Accept). Cyberya is doing again an explosive mix of dynamic-melodic power metal songs, and it will be hard to forget the melody lines.

After a very successful tour with U.D.O. Cyberya won a lot of new fans all over Europe and the number of selled Gods copies is more than respectable and surely two reasons for Breaker Records to offer a record deal to Cyberya. In December 2000 Cyberya started the recording sessions for their first full length album Mindcontrol, produced by Stefan Kaufmann.

This album reflects how metal sounds in 2001: catching songs, pounding drums, fast synths and brutal guitars - that's the sound of the next millennium, that's the sound of Cyberya.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cyberya">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
