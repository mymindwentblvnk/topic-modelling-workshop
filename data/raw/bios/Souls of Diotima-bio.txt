Souls of Diotima is the female-fronted Scenematic Exhilaration Metalâ„¢ band with a signature power progressive symphonic sound, fueled by 
commanding non-operatic vocals, fiercely-executed precision guitar solos, and thrilling orchestral compositions and sound effects, resulting in an unforgettable, mesmerizing style. 

The band debuted the "Sentence of the Blade" video in the summer of 2014 on its new VEVO artist channel.  In late July 2014 Souls of Diotima entered Fascination Street Studios in Orebro, Sweden to record its third album, a concept album.
