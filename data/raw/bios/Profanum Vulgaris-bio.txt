Poor devil reveals his face, gospel of the black rat echoing from the abyss. The lawless one is marching across the wasteland of proletkult. Soul crushing machinery is all that is left, old visions are shadowed and obscured. Beyond the boundaries of faith, just a broken mirror of all consuming corruption. Those are the slave songs, eyes used to darkness, the kingdom of light was built for parasites. Nowhere to ascend, nothing to prove, nightmares and strength, call of the dead. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Profanum+Vulgaris">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
