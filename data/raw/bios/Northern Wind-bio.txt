There are three groups under the name Northern Wind:
1. A Scandinavian electronica group with "wonderful melody and nice kicks and breaks..." "nice sounded strings and synths."
2. A northern style pow wow drum from Lake of the Woods, Ontario, the majority of the singers coming from North West Angle #33 and Whitefish Bay. The group has approximately 19 albums of which they are very proud. In November 2004 Northern Wind had the honor of receiving a Canadian Aboriginal Music Award for Best Traditional Pow Wow album for their album Whispering Winds.
3. An alternative/ambient/post hardcore band from central Pennsylvania. With comparisons to bands like Balance and Composure, Defeater and Citizen. Northern Wind was formed in 2014.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Northern+Wind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
