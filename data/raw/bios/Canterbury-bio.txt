Canterbury are an English rock band hailing from Hampshire, United Kingdom. The band consists of guitarist James Pipe, bassist/vocalist Luke Prebble, vocalist/guitarist Mike Sparks and drummer Scott Peters. 

They formed in 2005 and spent their last couple of years in school writing songs that would eventually become their debut album. In 2007, after leaving education, they began to take the band more seriously and took to the road, touring relentlessly for the next 4 years playing hundreds of shows around the UK and Ireland. Starting off in opening slots for anyone who would have them, they progressed to slots on much higher profile UK wide tours with the likes of Billy Talent, Enter Shikari, Against Me, Twin Atlantic and You Me At Six, and quickly gained themselves a country-wide following of fans. 

October 2009 saw the self-release of their debut album ‘Thank You’. The band decided they would put the album up for free download via their website with the idea that they wanted as many people as possible to hear their music without expecting them to pay out, or download it illegally, effectively ‘officially’ leaking the album. ‘Thank You’ received fantastic feedback in various national press reviews and took the band from their relatively ‘local’ status to a more well-known, yet still underground, national name within the UK music scene. To date the album has had well over 35,000 downloads and rising.

Work on the bands follow up release is now under way as they take time out from touring to write & record. Canterbury will be playing a few select UK festivals this summer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Canterbury">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
