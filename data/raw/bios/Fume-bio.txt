1. Fume was a band based in the town of Tampere, Finland, who seamlessly combined soaring melodies, metal-tinged riffs, and haunting folk-influenced passages. The distinct musical style of the four-piece rock band known as Fume enthralls the listener with songs of dark, complex beauty and raw emotional delivery. The sound of the band has been often compared to such pioneers of heavy alternative music as Tool and Helmet, but also to such classic acts as The Cure, R.E.M., and The Smiths.

2. Fume is a Lithuanian electronic music producer whose EP Hold Your Head High Ready for the Dive offers some beats, some trippy soundscapes and a fair amount of bass and is a musical journey inspired by the sea and the urban. Some sounds were digitally manipulated, some were recorded in Vilnius, the heart of Lithuania. http://fume1.bandcamp.com/ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fume">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
