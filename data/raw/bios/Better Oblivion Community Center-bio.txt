Better Oblivion Community Center is a collaborative project between Conor Oberst (Bright Eyes, Desaparecidos, Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band) and Phoebe Bridgers (boygenius) currently signed to Dead Oceans. After a cryptic media campaign featuring cult-like messaging on flyers and bus stop benches, Better Oblivion Community Center released its surprise, eponymous LP on January 23, 2019 with a debut appearance on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

The self-titled record featured instrumental performances by Dawes' Griffin Goldsmith and Wylie Gelber, Christian Lee Hutson, Bright Eyes' Nate Walcott, Deadfingers' Taylor Hollingsworth, Now It's Overhead's Andy LeMaster, Yeah Yeah Yeahs's Nick Zinner, and Tilly and the Wall's Nick White, among others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Better+Oblivion+Community+Center">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
