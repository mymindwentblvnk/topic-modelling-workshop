Necromanteion was founded by Murder and Nunfucker in mid 2009, the aim of the project being to produce the most raw black metal possible, uglier and more brutal than any other band on the South African music scene at the time.

"The Ninth Circle" all but defined the pace of the music, but vocals were in demand, and by September of the same year Siff had joined the band on vocals after an astoundingly successful audition. The music continued to get faster and more relentless, and soon the EP, Gateway, was in the works. The EP was completed on the 1st January 2010, and later distributed by Sweden's Pure Black Heart Productions. However, while all guitars on the EP were recorded by Murder, the band was still a member short. The spot was then filled by Raven, completing Necromanteion as a four-piece band. 
For personal reasons, Murder parted ways with Necromanteion mid-2010, leaving the band another member short. Fortunately enough, the spot was recently filled by Khrist, completing Necromanteion as a band, enough to play live shows and continue. 
They are currently looking for a Bassist, in JHB, South Africa. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necromanteion">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
