Moonthot was created in 2000. At the beginning band was named
Nigra Missa. Band members were: Cyber (guitar), Nocturnal (guitar), 
Mic (bass), Rozbit (drums), Pieloch (vocal). Nigra Missa's influences
were: early Behemoth, Emperor, Satyricon etc. Because of some
organisational and financial problems Nigra Missa disappeared from
black metal scene in June 2001 (after a few concerts). After several years of hibernation and unsuccessful attempt of reactivation Nigra Missa started to act as one-man project, MOONTHOT. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MOONTHOT">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
