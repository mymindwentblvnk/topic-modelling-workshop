One half of Masters at Work but also hugely successful in his own right as both a DJ and producer.  Started DJing in the mid 1980's with his first commercial productions available in the early 90's.  Taking influences from a wide range of styles: house, disco, funk, breaks, his varied productions mirror his eclectic listening tastes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kenny+Dope">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
