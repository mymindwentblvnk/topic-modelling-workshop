Dripping Orifice was formed in 2004 with former members of "Bludgeon to Death" Shea Ciaramitaro and Brandon White. Numerous lineup changes have occurred but always featured original bass player Curtis Spencer.

Following the acclaimed release of 2004's "Blood Red Meat Phlap" demo, Dripping Orifice has been shredding Montana's most brutal music right here in the Flathead Valley with modern influences from bands like Black Dahlia Murder, Job For A Cowboy, and Cephalic Carnage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dripping+Orifice">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
