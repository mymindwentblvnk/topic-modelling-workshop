Dirg Gerner is a London based maverick who wears his cardiac-box on his sleeve and croons away on pioneering productions with his silky smooth voice. He describes his craft as a mixture of therapy, the pursuit of truth, and an ongoing experiment with vibration. 

He’s a lover, a vulnerable observer, and clearly an artist, who’s managed to create an effective interface with the world with incredible speed. Dirg may appear to be media-shy, but when it comes to vocalizing, he’s a raw, uncut soul-element.

Real name: Dario Rojo Guerra
Alias: fLako

Unintentionally off-the-grid and committed to his personal sound evolution, Flako is more of a Soul-documentarian than a typical beat maker. With roots in Chile, raised in Germany, and currently living in London via Berlin – the man himself is a melange of flavor. His particular sonic palette is a mercurial blend of warm analogue colors and cutting-edge design. His writing is marked by manifest emotion. 

In a world jaded – caustic with sarcasm and packaged in plastic, he’s an example of an artist who’s fearless with his humanity. Not a fiend for the limelight, there’s no gimmick to his craft – ’cause in the end it’s all about an honest, well written tune.
