The Belgian singer-songwriter Vynk (birthname: Jan Vynckier) began as a classical pianist, taking classes at the conservatory for the arts in Leuven. After some classical compositions at the age of 14, his attention started to get drawn to the creation of pop- and rocksongs. He learned to play the guitar too and at the age 15, he'd already wrote some of his earliest creations. 
This first period of song-writing can be roughly dated from 2005-2007. In this period most of the songs were built around the central theme of love. Songs from the period after 2007 usually have more depth and other subjects such as hypocrites, sadness, loneliness, suicide etc. Recently he started writing songs is his own native dutch speach too. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vynk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
