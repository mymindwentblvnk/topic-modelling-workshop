Burial Invocation started in 2008 as an ode to the ancient and obscure death metal demos of the 90's. Following their own trail of desecration and decay, the band released a MLP, a split 7" with Anatomia and played on the first two incarnations of Kill-Town Death Fest before being laid to rest in 2012. The time passed bereft of any signs of life, but the soil was uneasy, the graveyard was in turmoil and apparently the souls weren't ready to be obliterated in an ignominious grave yet... Burial Invocation now ascends from its slumber once more to play a number of European shows in 2015.

Line-up:
Mustafa - Vocals
Cihan - Guitar
Dogu - Guitar
Malik - Bass
Aberrant - Drums
