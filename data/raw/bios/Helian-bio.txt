Finally starts the new sub-label or series named Nevskia (another biobacteria) which will release extemporaneousness some selected works of dark/gothic/ funeral black/agressive/industrial metal!

This series start with a great italian one man band act: HELIAN!

The Helian plan represents a vent channel in order to describe the chronic sadness that pervade every single day of the life, through the long depressive melodies of the guitars Danny has tried to give shape and sound to his feelings…

‘Sad city’ sounds as a little introspective journey in a sad grey mourning day which assist the (re)awakining of the sad city… the city which its dark palaces eats the light of the world. Four tracks between the guitars elements of Katatonia, the sadness of Anathema, the slow rhytm of Opeth and My Dying Bride with some Massive Attack influences!!!!!!”
