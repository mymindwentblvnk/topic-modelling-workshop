Mark Fell and Mat Steel formed SND in 1998 and were quickly placed at the forefront of new digital minimalism. With a series of influential releases on their own label SND and on the now defunct Frankfurt Mille Plateaux, SND pioneered a sound that combined the linear minimalism of Ryoji Ikeda and Oval, with the rhythmic geometry of techno artists such as Thomas Brinkmann or Derrick May.

SND promote an approach to the organization of sound, space and form that owes more to origami than any time based medium. SND explore the transformation of musical data: their music folds and unfolds, closes and opens, atomizes and regroups; a piece switches to a parallel version of itself, or gradually shifts into its opposite.

SND have performed internationally at major festivals, performance venues, and museums including: SONAR Festival of Advanced Music and Multimedia (Barcelona), Mutek (Montreal), ZKM (Karlsruhe),Anchorage (New York), The Barbican (London), Schirn (Frankfurt), Mousonturm (Frankfurt), Liquid Room (Tokyo), All Tomorrows Parties (UK), New Forms (Den Haag), Volksbuhne (Berlin), Videotage (Hong Kong), and Zouk (Singapore). They have also toured extensively, recently completing a European tour with Autechre. SND have been nominated for several awards for their work including Ars Electronica, Asia-Europe award and Quartz award for research in digital music.
