Progressive metal outfit Thirty Aethyrs started off, surprisingly, as an industrial collaberation between Malus and hiphop/electro producer Matt Kidd in late 2009 (the main riff for Vengeance for Noble Pagan Bloodshed hearkens back to this era). Malus asked Elly Bannister and Richard Corrie to lay down a few basslines and guitar parts to further bulk out the music, and together, the three of them set about writing a bit of music on the side, and The Aethyr drifted away from the industrial style.
After we had a few tracks written, they went to Spirit Studios in Manchester with the drummer from Synapse, Mad Ste Ings, and recorded their first EP, entitled "Master of the Spheres" over the course of the first few months of 2011, with an unrefined sound that blended elements of black metal, thrash and funk together. The most sucessful tracks from this release were "Welcome to the End of the World" and "Cosmic Insigificance Within the Aethyr".
Almost immediately after the release, Richard went off into hiding to write a veritable opus, expressing a desire to do a concept album. Now, well over a year later, with a new full-time drummer on board, Thirty Aethyrs have an entirely new sound, far more progressive and ambient, refined and mature, and have released a concept album based around an original story written by Malus. 
Expect darkness. Expect fear. Hear the call.
