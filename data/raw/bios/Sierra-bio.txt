Sierra is a name of at least eight music entities:

[1]  A passion-fuelled Mount Gambier, SA, Australia, melodic hardcore act who play music with meaning.  Energy is infectious, and a valuable asset in captivating an audience, and this is what we aim to provide in all facets of this band, whether it be live performance and recordings, to our dealings with fellow musicians, industry representatives, and most importantly our friends/supporters. 

The experiences we have been offered since this band formed in late 2010 have been both unexpected and overwhelming in nature, however the people we have met and places we have seen only further inspire us to grow as a collective and venture far from our regional setting.
