Onirophagus was born in September 2011 in order to play Death Doom Metal under the musical influence of bands like My Dying Bride, Ophis, old Anathema, Katatonia, Autopsy, Asphyx, Immolation, Incantation, Paradise Lost, Hypocrisy and Evoken among others.

The band is currently formed by Moregod (guitar and bass), Uretra (drums) and Paingrinder (Voices).

Their first work, "Defiler of Hope", is a 34 minutes long EP, formed by five long and heavy tracks and one piano outro. One thing that's particularly appreciable about the album is the organic sound that the producer, Javi Félez (Moontower Studios), has built in the final mix, oozing echoes of Hypocrisy and the works of Ophis. Every song in "Defiler of Hope" is a new compositional challenge. When it comes to the vocals, they bring power and sickness on a rich textured complexity of tones, doubled in climatic fragments.

"Defiler of Hope" features collaborations of Fiar (Foscor), Xavi (Decapitated Christ) and Von Päx (Barbarian Swords) in the vocals and guest guitars by Javi (Graveyard). The EP's art is a work of illustrator César Valladares, a dark and enigmatic layout, perfectly fitting with the band and their tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Onirophagus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
