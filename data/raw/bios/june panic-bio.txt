June Panic is an American singer-songwriter from Grand Forks, North Dakota. June, whose birth name is Jeremy Pruess though he legally changed it to June Preuss, first began performing and recording in 1990, and released his early material on cassette tape for the label 3 Out of 4 Records. His first CD was the initial release for the label Secretly Canadian; he released several full-length albums with the label. In 2007, he released a triple album containing 48 songs he had originally recorded on a four track and released between 1991 and 1996.

Panic plays every instrument on his releases. His lyrics often contain intentionally twisted or idiosyncratic imagery, a trait noted by reviewers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/June+Panic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
