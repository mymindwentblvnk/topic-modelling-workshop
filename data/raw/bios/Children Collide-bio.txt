Children Collide are an indie rock band from Melbourne, Australia. Their debut album, The Long Now was released on 11 October 2008 and was produced by David Sardy.

Johnny Mackay (guitar, vocals), Heath Crawley (bass) and Ryan Caesar (drums) formed the band in Melbourne a few years back after hitchhiking their way from Lismore. As founding members and principle songwriters, Johnny and Heath play raw over-driven rock, oozing a range of influences. Using stop-start rhythmic patterns coupled with contagious pop melodies and insightful lyrics they infect audiences with an insentient bite leaving their indie rocker victims with an incurable addiction. As much as you try to resist, you cant help but tap your feet and hum the melodies. Children Collide played their first live gig at Bar Open in Melbourne on Halloween night in October 2004. For a first show, Children Collide had the fortunate blessing of an amazing performance that everyone in the room loved. All the elements were there from the beginning - great songs, genius stage banter and a look that you couldnt help but envy. 

With a few demos under their belt and a 6 track EP on Reverberation Records behind them, (We Three Brave And True, 2005) Children Collide signed with Flying Nun Australia, sister label to indie gods Flying Nun New Zealand.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Children+Collide">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
