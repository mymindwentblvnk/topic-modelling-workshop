Doss makes dance music like a daydream of nights past, equal parts euphoria and ennui. This spring, a full seven years after releasing her cult-favorite self-titled debut, she will finally release its follow up for LuckyMe. Now based in New York, Doss first released music with the taste-making label Acephalé (SALEM, Air France), on an EP Pitchfork described as “an exploration of the pure joy of sensation.” As a DJ, she built a reputation for her nimble, light-hearted approach to bridging ’10s EDM and ’00s electro with classic trance and drum; bass — never quite serious but always sincere."
