Stacked melodies, distorted organs, stretched chords, reimagined vocals: Collections of Colonies of Bees/ Volcano Choir multi-instrumentalist Thomas Wincek drops his Emotional Joystick handle for the glorious themes of All Tiny Creatures. During the 17-minute titular piano triumph of "Segni" and through the luminous haze of "Street Lights Ten Thousand Feet," ATC's debut EP builds four ideas into four engrossing instrumentals. This limited-edition colored vinyl release is a prelude to ATC's debut LP - which will feature vocalists Justin Vernon (Bon Iver), Megafaun, and Ryan Olcott (12 Rods, Mystery Palace) - due in early 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/All+Tiny+Creatures">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
