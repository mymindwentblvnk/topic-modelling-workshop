Kill J is a singer, songwriter and producer from Copenhagen, Denmark.

Delivering an alternative take on the Scandinavian sound, Kill J is a project that was born out of a poetic longing for something simple, primal, dirty and pleasurable. The soundscape is smooth, dark and topped with airy and fragile vocals channeling the Nordic Noir but with a more voluptuous twist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/KIll+J">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
