Tel Aviv band Bones Garage marry post-punk aesthetics with surf rock accentuations and shoegaze sounds and textures, to create a luscious melodic sound that occasionally threatens to spin out of control. The band’s lyrics are touching, personal and relatable, yet they’re also unafraid to breach heavier topics referencing social justice, the plight of the modern man and basic human emotions. Dramatic, emotional and hard hitting; the ideal soundtrack for a post-apocalyptic party.

Bones Garage have released their first album, “Massacre/Dance”, in 2015, and have since performed in festivals such as Glastonbury, South by Southwest, The Great Escape and All Points East, among others. Their second album, “Oi Ma Yeah”, was released in April 2019. The band are currently working on their third album, which will be released in 2020. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bones+Garage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
