White Rose Movement was a post-punk/electro band from London, England. They mixed the post-punk style and attitude of early bands of the genre such as Joy Division and The Chameleons with a more New Romantic image reminiscent of bands like Duran Duran, Depeche Mode and A Flock of Seagulls, as well as more modern electroclash and post-punk revival influences. Their first album Kick was released April 17, 2006, after a long period of media hype and critical acclaim from the British indie music press.

Early in 2006 the band toured with The Rakes. Later in 2006, they played at the Coachella festival in California and Festival Internacional de Benic√†ssim near Barcelona, as well as support slots with Placebo and other festivals. Keyboardist Taxxi (Erica MacArthur) left the band in January 2008 to be replaced with Poppy Corby-Tuech.

The band announced the end of White Rose Movement. They won't be releasing a new album and the band gave their last concert on 16th April 2010 at Bilbao,Spain
