One of the Southwest’s premier metal bands, RISING PAIN, is back with a new CD release. Recorded by Byron Filson at Arizona’s Villain Recording, “War Of Souls” is the latest chapter in the popular band’s successful eight year run. The album demonstrates a new sophistication in RISING PAIN’S playing and in the fiery vocals of front man Justin Bredvig, while maintaining their trademark unique blend of traditional thrash and modern extreme metal styles.
RISING PAIN counts among its many influences such metal icons as MACHINE HEAD and PANTERA, yet forges its own exclusive and very appealing heavy sound. “We don’t limit ourselves by genre,” says Bredvig. “We don’t ever want to be stuck in a rut.” The project reflects a distinctive combination of skillfully outrageous heavy metal musicianship and thoughtful lyrics of social observation. 

“War Of Souls” is the follow-up to their album “The Essence of Decay” 2009, “Existence Is Futile”2007(distributed through Open Grave Records) and “Salvation for None” 2003 and features the line-up of Bredvig with brothers Ricky and Danny Racines on guitar and bass respectively, and Andy Luffey on drums. A second guitarist, Joe Saari joined the band recently and adds a new dimension to the music. 
The Ep will be released April 30th, 2011
