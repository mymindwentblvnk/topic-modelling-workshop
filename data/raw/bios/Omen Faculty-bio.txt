Formed in 2000 by producer/engineer/multi-instrumentalist J. Alexander. Originally started out doing parodies and gone through numerous lineup & musical style changes, now just a one-man project that stuck with its dark presence both in the music and appearance. Omen Faculty's music is well-known for being unsteady, ranging from goth, hardcore, extreme, and industrial metal. Heavily influenced by metal pioneers like Type O Negative, Fear Factory, Machine Head, and Ministry; and captivated fans with LPs like "The Origin of Evil [2006]', "All That Matters [2009]", their 2010 self-titled release, and the latest "Everything Ends [2011]". This project is a monster with its own unique drive. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Omen+Faculty">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
