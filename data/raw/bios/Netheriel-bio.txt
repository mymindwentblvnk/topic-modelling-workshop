Netheriel is a Death Metal band from Calgary, Alberta who deal in themes of Satanism, Misanthropy, Blasphemy and Eschatology (the study of the end of the world). They began in 2007 as a basement project consiting of only two guitarists and a vocalist, but began completing their line up in 2010 to include a Drummer. The music can best be described as brutal/technical Death Metal in the vein of Morbid Angel, Deicide and others of the genre with minor Black Metal influecnes. Currently Netheriel has two self-produced albums available for mail order on their official site.
