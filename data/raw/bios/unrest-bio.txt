1. An indie band from Washington DC, Unrest formed in 1983 and were initially made up of Mark Robinson (lead guitar) and Phil Krauth (drums). In this form they experimented with a range of genres, and pinning them down was virtually impossible. 

They didn't gain a great deal of popularity until they were joined by Bridget Cross (bass) in 1990. With Bridget's arrival their sound transformed into a more stable, brit-poppy one - they're often described as being in the shoegazing genre thanks to their unconfrontational, repetitive music.

Gradually attaining minor success, Unrest's most popular albums were probably Imperial F.F.R.R. and Perfect Teeth. Following these albums Unrest's output slowly wound down, and they broke up in 1994. 

Following the split, Mark and Bridget continuing to work together as Air Miami for a short while, and Phil went on to a solo career. Mark still releases solo projects, and runs the teenbeat label.

In 1991 the first album TASTE IT was produced at the Delta-Studio Wilster (Schleswig-Holstein / Germany) which was released in 1992. 1994 the second album BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON was produced and was available at the shops in early 1995. First larger gigs with bands such as RAGE and SKYKLAD followed until in 1996 the first successful tour with ICED EARTH and NEVERMORE throughout Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands came up. Afterwards, the third CD WATCH OUT was produced in Osterholz-Scharmbeck (Niedersachsen / Germany). After its release in 1997 came the UNREST / SCANNER tour which led all the way to Italy. In the same year tours with W.A.S.P. and SINNER followed. In 1998, right on time for the band`s 10th anniversary, the fourth record COLD STEEL WHISPER was released and UNREST played at the WACKEN OPEN AIR FESTIVAL that same year. In 1999 the RESTLESS AND LIVE recorded was produced. It was released in 2000 followed closely by BLOODY VOODOO NIGHT which appeared in 2001. That same year UNREST toured the country with DIO and SINNER followed by a few concerts at several clubs in Germany until UNREST unfortunately was put into cold storage for about 3 years. In the beginning of the year 2004 al three founding members Sönke, Claus and Guido came together again just for kickstarting through anew with their two new band members André Neuhaus (bass) and Marco Liedtke (g.). Since that time new songs were written and several shows played just to announce their comeback impressively to the still existing fan community.
