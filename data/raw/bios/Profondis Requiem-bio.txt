The band Profondis Requiem was created in August 2005 in Dole in the Jura by Ezekiel (guitar and vocals) and Neurasthenia (bass) in the will to create a group of black dark and depressive metal influenced by Scandinavian groups such as Burzum or Darkthrone, by groups of black depressive Swede like Shining or Silencer and by the work of Herr Morbid in Forgotten Tomb.

The band lived many changes of drummers until November 2005 when Ashatan integrates the group then Wörg in February 2006. Finally Arawn will take the Rhythmic Guitar and Selmordesk the Battery in Mars 2006.

Profondis Requiem draws its texts for major the part in French from the tortured spirits of Ezekiel and of Neurasthénia, the music is entirely composed by Ezekiel. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Profondis+Requiem">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
