Pictures Inside Me is a 5-piece band from Mariupol, Ukraine, Eastern Europe. We've been playing music since 2007, mostly metalcore, but only in early 2010 we realized that the time has come to change something. We've created our sound by combining heavy hardcore riffs with melodic parts and little bit of electronic synths and that was it!

We enjoy what we do and hope you'll enjoy it too!

OUR HEARTS ARE MELODIC

The band members are:
Serj Kravchenko - vocals
Dmitriy Bezruchko - guitar
Andrey Martynishin - guitar
Dmitriy Uljanov - bass
Igor Merezhaniy - drums
