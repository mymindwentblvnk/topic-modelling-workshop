Diablo Red came to be in 2002, influenced by classic '70s heavy riffage and dirty southern blues rock. Old friends from their days playing in punk and metal bands in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, Rob Hare and Bill Kole began writing the songs that would form the sonic nucleus of Diablo Red after splitting from their previous bands in 2001. Growing up listening to the great 70's rock and 80's and 90's metal playing on Detroit rock radio, Rob and Bill found their natural style to be the dark space between Sabbath and Skynyrd, with the vocals a mixture of raw rock emotion and dark blues soul. Long time friend and skin-bashing maniac Brett Savory (ex Inner Misery) joined the boys in Spring 2002, and Paul Mancuso joined in 2006, solidifying the group's current recording and touring line-up.
Diablo Red is the truth - red hot rock and roll evil, hard, fast, heavy and dirty. Diablo unleashed their debut full length, "Rojos", in December of 2005. Their second album, "Vol. II: Statue of Mary with Bullhorns", was released March 18th, 2006. The boys are currently recording and mixing the culmination of five years of blood, sweat and beer, "Vol. III: Lower The Troll". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diablo+Red">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
