Ghost Ship Octavius was formed in 2014  by guitarist Matt Wicklund (God Forbid, Himsa) and drummer Van Williams (Nevermore, Ashes of Ares, Pure Sweet Hell). After some searching for a singer the duo soon discovered what they were looking for in the very talented up and coming vocalist, guitarist Ad≈çn Fanion. In April of 2014 the trio launched a KickStarter campaign and successfully raised from anticipating backers over 17k for their debut album. After the 45 day campaign the band fine tuned their sound with the help of producer/ guitarist ( 7 horns 7 eyes) Aaron Smith (envisage audio) and have come out the other end with 11 stunning tracks that are rich with a unique blend of melody, texture, atmosphere and groove. The group also asked bassist Dagna Silesia (The People Now) to lay down some bass tracks for the record and to join them for live shows when the time comes to hit the stage. 
With the album releasing world wide March 23rd 2015, the inevitable live shows grow increasingly near!
