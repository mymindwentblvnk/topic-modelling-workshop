The following biography is borrowed and amended slightly from the bio found on the official Headmess website:

"The original Headmess line up formed in late `97, and soon after that, recorded their debut 5 track EP Wigged, with Richie Rudder from "The Reel Thing" studios. Reduced to a four piece band shortly thereafter, Headmess then regularly gigged around Victoria, from country Victoria venues to Melbourne city venues such as The Espy, The Tote, Nicholson's Hotel, The Fox and Hounds, The Evelyn, Edward's Tavern and many more, plus all age shows through the both the "Freeza" and "The Push" organisations in regional and metro areas.

Wigged has had airplay on a variety of radio stations such as Triple R and local radio stations such as "Southern FM" in Moorabbin, where Headmess were also interviewed by their late night heavy music show "Generation X", and the local station "UG FM" in Alexandra had the band up there for an interview!

Headmess have teamed up with local Aussie bands such as PreShrunk, Magic Dirt, Nancy Vandal, Brown Hornet, Killing Hiedi, Minotaur, Cyclone Tracy, Fstar, 20 Minutes, Poetry In Voilence, Mind Riot, Threepoint and many many more.

Now into the Year 2000, Headmess have released their follow up EP entitled Rage Against Pokies. This new CD incorporates the new Headmess sound and songs into more than just a new CD/EP... Headmess are (as you would imagine from the CD title) RAGING AGAINST POKIES!! They think that there are FAR too many venues being overrun with pokie machines!!
