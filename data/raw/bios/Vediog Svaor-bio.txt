Vediog Svaor was a one man band from St. Martin D'Heroes, France. The band fused black metal with psychedelic influences, making the music very original and highly progressive. 

They released one split in '97 and one full-length in 2001, entitled In The Distance. Currently, the band is split up, however Van Vadermark, the man behind the music, stated in an interview, that he'd like to continue his experimentation with black metal.
