Forteresse was born on an irrelevant day of 2006 in the ruins of Montréal. In this age where few remember their ancestors and the honored traditions that have forged La Belle Province, Forteresse stands proud to oppose the degeneration of its homeland. Narrated by Moribond and Athros, Metal Noir Québécois stand as an hommage to ancient traditions and to all those that long to see the banner of liberty rise at last. PATRIOTIC, EPIC BLACK METAL.
