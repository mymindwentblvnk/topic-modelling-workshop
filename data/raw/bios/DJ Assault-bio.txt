Craig Adams and Ade Mainor released a number of influential 12"s and Mix CDs as DJ Assault on their Assault Rifle and Electrofunk labels in the 90's. Amongst these were the classic "Ass N Titties", "Return of Terrortech" , "Let Me C U Pop" and the "Straight Up Detroit Shit" mix series which helped define the hyrbid Ghetto Tech sound emerging from the Motor City. 

After an acrimonious split in 2000, Adams continued working under the DJ Assault name while Mainor adopted the moniker Mr. De'. Both have since forged their own sound with Assault leaning more towards the Hip Hop elements of Ghetto Tech and Mr. De' making more electro based explorations.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Assault">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
