Midnight Malice is a traditional heavy metal 4 piece from Toronto, Ontario.
Fronted by former Skull Fist guitarist Caleb Beal, this band emerged into the Toronto metal scene in the spring of 2010, playing their first show at The Poor Alex Theatre with local heavymetal heavy weights Cauldron and Fatality.
Their sound has been compared to metal massacre and NWOBHM era bands.
