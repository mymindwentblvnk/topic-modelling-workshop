Formed in 2003 in Evansville, Indiana, Blood Tribe set out to assault the listener's eardrums with their own blend of varying genres of metal. Having had personal issues with the vocalist, BT set out to find someone more fitting, they found Drew, formerly of Shatter The Odds, to step up and fill the void. Drew answered with flying colors and BT has once again set out to brutalize the world, with their own brand of no holds barred metal.

BT has two self-released studio albums and  is going into the studio soon to record their third, the first since signing with Dark Harvest Records. BT has played well over 300 shows and have opened for such bands as Origin, Cephalic Carnage(twice), Macabre, Pungent Stench, Cannae(twice), Vital Remains, Fuck The Facts(twice), Obituary, Daath, Neuraxis, 25 ta life, Invocation Of Nehek, Psyopus, Bowel's Out etc....
