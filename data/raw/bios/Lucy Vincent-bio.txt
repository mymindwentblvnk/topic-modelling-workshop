Formed in the summer of 2005 on the Island of Marthas Vineyard, Lucy Vincent is that feel good sound from the islands, with an undeniable groove and overflowing energy that puts a smile on your face and shake in your ass.

With an original sound that blends everything from the catchy songwriting of Sublime and the lyrical and musical sophistication of The Police, to the pounding tribal pulse of Rusted Root and the pure party atmosphere of Jamiroquai, Lucy Vincent brings it all in a tight Power Trio package that is sure to rock any club,party or private function.

Word has spread quickly about the band's high energy live performances through circles of college students and local music critics alike, all agreeing on the fact that Lucy Vincent is truly "Feel Good Music." Lucy Vincent played over 120 shows in their first year as a band including opening spots for Blues Traveler, Grace Potter and The Nocturnals, Galactic, Entrain, Ryan Montbleau, Teddy Geiger, Toubab Krewe, Garaj Mahal, Kyle Riabko and Melvin Sparks.

Having just released their second full length CD, Lucy Vincent will be touring extensively for the next year to bring the world ultimate joy through music.
