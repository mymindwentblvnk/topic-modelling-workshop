Bombs Of Death formed to pay tribute to 2 of the members' favorite thrash bands: Slayer (US) and Hirax. Their only release was a split 7" with Acrid. Supposedly there were plans to record another split 7", but it never materialized.

Lineup was:
Dylan Scharf - Vocals <Struggle>
Steve Heritage - Guitar, Bass (Ass√ºck, Anthem 88, Jud Jud & The People's Court)
Hirax Max (Max Ward) - Drums (Spazz, Plutocracy, Capitalist Casualties, What Happens Next?, Scholastic Deth, & founder of 625 Thrash) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bombs+of+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
