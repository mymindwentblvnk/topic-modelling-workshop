Let's face it, band biographies are always full of bullshit. Over-saturated with comparisons and reasons why this band or that band is so awesome that you'll be wetting your pants when they go on stage. Chicago's Thunderunderus is not one of these bands. They are four dudes who just love Rock N Roll and having a good time. Formed in late 2007 with one goal in mind, crank that shit up and rock.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/thunderunderus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
