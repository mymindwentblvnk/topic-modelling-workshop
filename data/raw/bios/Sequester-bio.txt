Sequester is the musical project of Canadian singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Ryan Boc. Founded in 2005, all of the material thus far has been written, performed, recorded and produced by Boc, having drawn inspiration from various genres of music including: heavy and thrash metal, progressive and psychedelic rock, traditional English and Scottish folk, grunge, alternative rock, blues, jazz, and classical.

Sequester’s sound has been described as being both expressive and melodic, with frequent use of counterpoint and harmonized layering in both the guitar and vocal sections. The songs are usually long in duration due to progressive structuring and arrangement, utilizing numerous sectional changes throughout each piece. Common lyrical themes include fantasy literature, history, folklore and mythology, as well as human nature, spirituality, and personal topics; generally they are sung with a clean voice— oftentimes with thrashy, more aggressive overtones.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sequester">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
