Ynoji is a 'collective' zooming around the beginning bedroom wizard Lucian Ditulescu who got inspired three years ago by a live set of S'kp to jump into the fruity-vortex and start oozing wonders. He produces hyper driven tortured mechanic emotions from an unknown A.I. trying to mimic organic feelings. Ynoji is beyond any genre or style, he is pure sound and the energy it produces.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ynoji">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
