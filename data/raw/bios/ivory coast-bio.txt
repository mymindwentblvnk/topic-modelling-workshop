There is more than one artist known as Ivory Coast.

1.A post punk band from Melbourne Australia active from the mid to late eighties. It featured now successful author Andy Griffiths on vocals and keyboards.  The band was named after a song by the band  Savage Republic and did a cover version of that tune. They later changed their name to Skippy the Butcher.
Ivory Coast were formed in Melbourne, Australia by Robin Schmidt (Bass) and Rick Hastewell (Lead Bass) after the collapse of their previous band Polar 1500 in early 1985. The group was named after the Savage Republic single. Joining them were Peter Shaw (ex Crushed Buzzards on Drums) and Frank Lombado on Saxophone. The line up was competed by the addition of Andy Giffiths (fresh from Gothic Farmyard) on Vocals. The band would be described as "Alternative industrial pop". They gigged through 1985 and in 1986 recorded the Demo “How can I stop the leak if you won’t stop pealing off my bandaids?" The Demo was released under the bands new name Skippy the Butcher, to some acclaim, but soon after Griff left the band to pursue his literary career, yes, he is the man who wrote “The Day My Bum Went Psycho”.
Rick moved to Vocals (still playing Lead Bass), Pete moved to Guitar and Rick Ferrara joined on Drums.
