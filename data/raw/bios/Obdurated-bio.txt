OBDURATED is a french melodic death metal band created in 2001.

After the composition of the first titles and the begining of the shows, a first demo, Slovenly Nation, is recorded in 2003. Fast rythms, melodies and agressive vocals are the main elements of OBDURATED's music. The influences come from heavy metal to death metal, going through "swedish thrash".

The first feedbacks being positive, the band releases its second demo : Lobotosodomized by TV in 2004 and then prepares its first album.

Thus in 2005 is being released Living In Failure, self-produced album, which allows the band to do many live shows and more important fests the next two years. After a change of line-up starts the composition of the second album.

In 2008 OBDURATED records The Answers Within, and a cover from SOILWORK : Song Of The Damned, and starts looking for a label while playing more and more live and starting to play abroad.

At the end of 2009, after another change of line-up, the band signs with Pervade Productions / Manitou Music. The release of the album is planned for March 15th 2010 and the third album is being written.
