2.) Nomadic, Godless harsh industrial/dark ambient/auditory surrealism artist. Set in America, at the moment, but relocating on a constant basis, Masochrist's work is the composite form of expression ranging from the angry recantings of the Yahweh Disorder era, to the creepy drawl of the Apathy era, to the pleasant ambience of the "Nomadic" side-project.

3.) An Electronic Black Metal band from Brazil fusing industrial and electronic beats and samples with raw, primitive black metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Masochrist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
