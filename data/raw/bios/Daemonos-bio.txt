Daemonos was founded in the south of The Netherlands during the rainy autumn of 2013. While blending the pure brutality of Death Metal with the cold atmosphere of Black Metal, unique songs take shape. Powerful screeching guitars, earth-trembling bass, demonically fast war drums and inhuman vocals are the key elements that create the identity of the band.
The band played various shows including the opening spot for the Greek band Rotting Christ in December 2014 and for the Italian band Sawthis in March 2015.
In September 2015 the band released their first DEMO/EP entitled Primogenitus Daemonium pt. 1 “Infernum In Terra”. This release contains 5 songs, which give a good impression of the variety the band offers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daemonos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
