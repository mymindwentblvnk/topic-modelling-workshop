Personal Trainer is an indie rock band from Amsterdam, The Netherlands, fronted by Willem Smit, who also fronts Canshaker Pi and is an omnipresent force in the Amsterdam indie scene.

Personal Trainer is Smit's constantly changing garage rock collective. They released a steady stream of singles and EPs since 2016, most of them somewhat under the radar, initially. Personal Trainer's output will certainly not disappoint lovers of bands such as Protomartyr, Pavement or Scram C Baby. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Personal+Trainer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
