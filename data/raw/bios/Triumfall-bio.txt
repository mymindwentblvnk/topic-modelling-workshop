Triumfall (triumphal fall, refering to the Fallen angel) was formed in Kragujevac in July of 2006 by the three members of a young Serbian black metal band Veles; guitarist and vocalist Atterigner, keyboardist Phantom, bassist Upyr, and Defluens, the drummer of Introitus, founder of black metal in this part of Europe. One month later, Triumfall was completed by the arrival of guitarist Vorzloth, who was also the first drummer of Veles. In March 2007 Upyr joins the army and new bassist Beleth takes over his place.

Triumfall is the embodiment of the common dream of these five betrayers of the light to create a mighty and elite black metal band encompassing somber atmosphere, polyphonic themes as well as contemporary and violent musical expresion. Triumfall's spiritual quintessence is the one with the aestethics of the Darkside. Glorification of Darkness and Death is not a matter of free choice, but an outcome of self consciousness of the rebellious spirits and purity of the black hearts.The song Rise of Pantheon was recorded during the last week of March at Wild Cat studio in Kragujevac and it will be featured on Butcherian Vibe's compilation that should be released in May, and also on the first Triumfall's album that is going to be recorded during this year.

The band is signed to Norwegian label Forces of Satan Records, owned by Infernus of Gorgoroth. The debut full-length is expected to be released in the beginning of 2009. The name of the album is "Antithesis of All Flesh".
