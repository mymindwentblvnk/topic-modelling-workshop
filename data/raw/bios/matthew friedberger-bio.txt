Matthew Friedberger, born 21st October 1972, is one half of the brother and sister band, The Fiery Furnaces where he plays the majority of the instruments and provides some vocals. Prior to starting The Fiery Furnaces, Matthew Friedberger played in various other bands, including Corndolly, Liquorette, The Mezzanines and The Grand Vizars. 
His first solo release is a double album entitled "Winter Women/Holy Ghost Language School" and was released on August 8, 2006.
It is believed during the recording process Matthew played every single instrument himself except for a few drumbeats. "Winter Woman" has been described as a "breezy summer album" as Matt explores his more poppy songwriting skills. A rather eclectic album, Winter Woman takes many styles which come together to create distinct and very different tracks, though the album doesn't sound too disjointed and flows fairly well.
In contrast, "Holy Ghost Language School" is more of a concept album. Matt himself describes it as "a noise record" and "an obscure story about christian businessmen."
After the release Matt stated that he had no plans to tour but instead intended to head back to the studio with his sister Eleanor Friedberger to record another Fiery Furnaces album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Matthew+Friedberger">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
