From the deepest, darkest forests of Norway comes FUEL FOR DISASTER, an infernal musical army led by the feared Chontaraz, who possesses an evil, darker than ever known to man. And the only way to keep this evil controlled is to spread the darkness that lies within their music in every hellhole they visit on this earth.

Armed to the teeth with majestic riffs and larger than life anthems, their long awaited debut-album “Chontaraz Khlan Krakatau” is ready to be unleashed upon this world. With a unique combination of enchanting melodies and the aggression of Norwegian “svartmetall”, this album is sure to showcase that Norwegian metalbands have so much more to offer.

So prepare yourself to be dragged into the world of Chontaraz and his clan of hellish warriors, and experience the band live in 2013!
