Paul and Hewson (then in Vitesse, now in The New Lines) began playing as Alsace Lorraine in 2000. They released "Through Small Windows" in 2001, with Ruth Welte and Caitlin Brice. During the following year, the group played a series of shows in Chicago and Austin, then went on hiatus as Paul recovered from the effects of a coma. Only a few compliation tracks were released between 2002 and 2006. During this period, Isol was touring extensively and recording what would become 3 albums and an EP with the Buenos Aires group Entre Rios. She joined Alsace Lorraine during the recording of "Dark One" (available April 9 2007 from Darla). The group are at work on a third record. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alsace+Lorraine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
