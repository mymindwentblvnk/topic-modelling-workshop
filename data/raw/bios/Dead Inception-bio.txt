Dead Inception is a one man Death Metal ensemble from Arizona founded by frontman Chad Hill, with him on Guitar(s), Drums, Vocals and Bass. Chad has always had a destructive vision for a Death Metal band with him on guitar but hasnt been able to find reliable Drummer, so he came up on some drums. In 2011 Dead Inception was born when Chad recorded his first song "Tools Of Deception" and released his first self-produced album Programmed Insanity in 2012 on Createspace, Amazon, and Itunes. Dead Inception is currently looking for a full-time drummer.
