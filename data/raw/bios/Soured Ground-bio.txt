Soured Ground is a four-piece crossover thrash metal band formed in Syracuse, NY in 2015. The band was created out of the ashes of several of the area's most significant defunct punk, hardcore and metal acts. 

Their first demo was released in April 2016 titled "Demo 2016". 

Soured Ground's live performances are known for being unique in that they play without the use of traditional stage lighting often surrounded by cemetery-inspired backdrops, opting to employ heavy usage of audio samples from relatively unknown 70's/80's horror films (and dark soundscapes created by the band themselves) in place of directly addressing their audience with the typical between-song stage banter. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soured+Ground">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
