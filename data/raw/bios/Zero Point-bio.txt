Zero Point was an alternative hard rock band out of Knoxville, TN. Formed in 2008 and disbanded in 2011, the band made an impact on the local scene by winning two battle of the bands competitions as well as appearing as a featured local artist on Knoxville's rock station 94.3 the X. The hard work and dedication of all members of the band yielded them a powerful set of original songs as well as great cover songs to keep the crowd entertained and hungry for more. The band's sound was deeply rooted in the modern hard rock genre, but drew upon all eras of rock music to give them their own unique sound. The band finished recording their first album in 2009 and it can be purchased now on iTunes, www.myspace.com/zeropointbandsite, and on Facebook. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zero+point">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
