Storm the Walls formed in early 2007 in Swansea, Wales, United Kingdom when five friends who had been jamming together since 2004 decided to combine their talents seriously. The band, which consists of Michael Collins on vocals, Ross Pullin and Craig Davies on guitar, Liam Scannell on bass and Adam Henderson on drums, write music that takes influence from a wide variety of genres. The result is a combination of old-school thrash, doom-laden chords and upbeat riffs that are intertwined with melody and heavy breakdowns.

      The band has a reputation for their gigs, where they bring all the ferocity of their songs to a live setting. Crowds leave venues awestruck at the energy, aggression and precision the band deliver their songs with and with each show new fans are gained. The five members arenâ€™t afraid to throw guitars and even their own bodies across the stage and even into the crowd in the name of putting on a good show.

Storm the Walls disbanded in November 2014.
