Elvenpath stepped into the picture in early 2002, hailing from Frankfurt (Central Germany) with the intention of stretching an overcrowded Metal scene yet a little more. Contrary to the main part of that scene they’d bring something different: heart, soul, passion and damn good songs.

Despite everything in their way Elvenpath has persevered since then, releasing three cd’s, playing more than 50 shows, among others sharing the stage with bands like Sabaton, Custard, Majesty, Wizard, Cage and Grailknights, touring Europe as support to Skyclad and gaining themselves a name especially with their very powerful and energetic live show. 

Elvenpath bears Metal in their hearts which you can easily hear in every single note of their music. If you favour trends, triviality or undemanding music, this isn’t your place. But if you’re into high quality Power Metal you’ll fall for this band quickly – both on cd and live.
