Defeat is either:

1. An electro-industrial/EBM duo from England formed in 1995. Their sound is a hybrid of NIN, Nitzer Ebb, Skinny Puppy and Gary Numan.

2. An Australian DJ who has truly come up with his own distinct sound that has that edge to it. Rolling with the likes of Redial and Danger, Defeat makes driving distorted melody based electro tracks with a lot of retro influences. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/defeat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
