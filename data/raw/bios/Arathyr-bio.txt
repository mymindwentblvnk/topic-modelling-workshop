Arathyr officially came into existence in February 2004, when the drummer, Dishar, joined the two guitarists, Boghusz and Zguben. Admittedly, the idea of the group was born several months earlier, but as long as it existed at below strength there was no possibility to have regular rehearshals and strong motivation. From the very beginning the group focusses on its own material. After four months of looking for a bass guitarist, ultimately the function has been taken by Lugh. Then, after intensive rehearsals during the following two months, Arathyr has recorded, at studio DBX, its first demo, composed of five pieces (four best pieces of its own and the cover of the group (Emperor 'I am the Black Wizards') and has given first two concerts. In October the drummer, Dishar, left the group; at the same time Boghusz and Zguben joined (as Abominator and Morbiden) the group Damned (which was created in effect of breakup of the group Arren). Retrospectively one can say that at this moment activity of Arathyr was suspended, because then it was limited to some meaningless rehearsals with different drummers. This state of affairs and some internal disagreements had very negative impact on the group. Only a year later, in October 2005, Arathyr got to work and in several weeks the group, with new drummer - Hexen, entered once again studio DBX to record promo 'Mourning Voices', and in February 2006 registered, at Sophiria Studio, the demo containing materials created in 2003-2004. Actually Abominator and Morbiden finish composing material for the first disk. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arathyr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
