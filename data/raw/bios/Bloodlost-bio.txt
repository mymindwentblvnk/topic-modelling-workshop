Bloodlost is a Thrash Metal Band formed in Sion, Valais Switzerland in In 2005, Tchico (guitar, vocals) and Rob (guitar) thought that thrash metal was dying and formed BLOODLOST to do something about it! Norcrow (bass) and Nico (drums) then completed the line-up.
They released their first demo “Discover The Hell” in 2006. About 2 years later, the debut “Hellcome” followed and was presented in the course of an European tour in 2009 as well as on support gigs for bands like Destruction or Napalm Death.
In 2009, Rob left the band, Lionel was announced as new bassist and Norcrow took over the guitar.
In 2011, BLOODLOST entered the Roystone Studio to record their second album “Trashell“.   As in many other bands, BLOODLOST’s line-up changed during the years and in 2013 they decided to continue as a trio, after Norcrow left the band.
With a new record deal with Massacre Records and a booking contract with Red Lion Music unter their belt, the future looks bright for BLOODLOST from Switzerland!   A few gigs are already scheduled for 2015, with their long-time roadie Norgrim supporting them live on guitar.
The videoclip for the new song “Legion From Hell” is already available on youtube !
