Combining the brutality of bands such as Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation and Origin with the technicality of bands such as Necrophagist, Vile and Decapitated; We plan on bringing these characteristics together with a progressive vibe. The brutality will still remain, but new ideas will emerge; this we believe will give us our own unique sound among the death metal scene.

Formed in 2003, Dustin and Kyle (previous Nex Mortalis guitarist) began under the name Terminal Chaos, and then a year later added a third guitarist by the name of Troy Freeman. The idea of a third guitarist seemed brilliant because of the technical harmonies they could arrange. After the acquisition of a drummer months later, Patrick Crane, the name was soon changed to a better fitting name; Nex Mortalis. In latin, Nex Mortalis translates roughly to "violent death among mortals". They released a demo in late 2005; however, months later, Troy left the band due to the extra gain and projection of a third guitarist which made Nex Mortalis's sound unclear and unarticulate. Carlo was added to the lineup during the recording of From Creation to Decimation as the bassist. After the recording of From Creation to Decimation, there was a slight lineup change; Kyle was released from the band Haim was added to the lineup as the vocalist shortly after. Right now Nex Mortalis is working on new material for a new release which we will be distributing to record labels, it will contain 6 all new songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nex+Mortalis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
