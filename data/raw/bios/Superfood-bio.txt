Superfood are one of the finest examples yet that British guitar music is moving beyond the mere glimpses of a resurgence for 2014. Hailing from the Midlands, the young quartet take an artfully crafted, classic college-rock blueprint and present it with sharp, blistering force.
 
Fronted by Dom Ganderton (a man who spends his dwindling down-time in music production), the band’s formation to becoming one of the buzz names on blogs and in venues across the UK and beyond has been swift based solely on an early self-titled demo and their fevered live show.  These ruthlessly sharp performances have become diary events, and mirror the party atmosphere that Superfood tumbled out of in the warehouses spaces of their native homeland before the band had a name.
 
The release of December’s Bubbles/Melting, and a debut EP in February 2014 should cement the band’s reputation as one of the most exciting young acts in the UK today.
