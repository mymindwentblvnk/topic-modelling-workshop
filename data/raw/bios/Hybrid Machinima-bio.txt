About the band
Hybrid Machinima are a band from the west coast of scotland, formed from their love of metal and rock in mid 2006. immediately they knew this was the band they needed to be a part of, all coming from other local bands and all feeling slightly removed, and outcast from the mediocre ramblings of their previous bands, Hybrid Machinima was, and still is a release. with major influences including vivaldi, tool, iron maiden, cradle of filth and dimmu borgir their sound draws from a vast array of styles and can only be described as unique, so have a listen, and enjoy

About the debut cd
We recorded the cd ourselves, at our rehersal studios, we basically rehersed until we got the songs just the way we wanted them to sound and recorded them, none of us knew a lot about the recording process or anything to do with it, but it captured our unique style and sound, so we stuck with it !

A bit about what the band are upto now

as of april 2007 the band are in the studio recording a full length album as yet to be named which is promising to smash anything the band have previously recorded
when asked about the direction of this new offering, front man Zorgon replied

“it’s a bit of a change for us – we have always been an instrumental band, but we are now recording tracks with vocals in them – we still do kick ass instrumentals but we have these songs now, they are, well –they are totally sick – like nothing you have ever heard before – we have been in the studio with a friend of ours – he is called Jonathan Mitchell, he knows how we want to sound and just gets it right for us – he has had a lot of creative input which is unusual as we usually don’t listen, but he is a metalhead, into cradle of filth and dimmu borgir, just like us so that helped a lot – we even have some orchestral buts in there !!”
 

2007 is promising to be a very busy year for the band, so make sure to bookmark their site and stay up to date with the goings on !!!
