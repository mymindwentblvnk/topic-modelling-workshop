Kill Syndicate was formed in July of 2004. This group shares the common goal of bringing heavy underground metal straight to your doorstep. With influences from the likes of All Shall Parish, Machine Head, Unearth, Lamb of God, and many more, Kill Syndicate pushes their music and live performances full throttle. Now available as a free agent to any hardworking label, KS is signed with Red Dragon Booking Agency and has national sponsorship from Monster Energy Drink & STG FAM Clothing Co., and promotional backing and support from Voo Doo Productions, as well as FIST Music and Hapi Skratch Records.
Touring frequently in the USA, this band will be one to keep an eye on as they rise to the challenge of meeting the sadistic needs of local and national metal heads.
