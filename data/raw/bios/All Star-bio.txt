Rapper All Star earned his street-cred by growing up on Nashville's east side, an area known as "Cashville," sometimes "Cashville, Ten-a-Key" as in "ten a kilo." With survival being the name of the game, All Star's raps were gritty tales of the Southern struggle, delivered hard with a street teen's swagger. He began attacking the mixtape circuit in 2003, earning the nickname "Cashville's Prince" thanks to his charismatic mixing of ambition and arrogance. Club tracks soon became a factor in All Star's street music, and one in particular, "Grey Goose," with Young Jeezy and Yo Gotti, exploded across the Tennessee Valley in 2005. Yo Gotti signed the artist to his Inevitable Entertainment imprint before landing a deal with Cash Money Records, quickly moving All Star into the major leagues. As G-Unit soldier Young Buck was declaring him the South's next superstar during a 2006 BET television appearance, All Star was in the studio working on his debut album, Streetball.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/All+Star">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
