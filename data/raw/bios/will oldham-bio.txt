Will Oldham (born 24 December 1970) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor. His music is often (perhaps inappropriately) placed under the genre of "alternative country". Oldham was born in Louisville, Kentucky. He briefly attended Brown University.

Oldham has recorded under many names other than his own, including Palace, Palace Brothers, Palace Music, Palace Songs, and Bonnie 'Prince' Billy. He often plays and records with other musicians, including David Pajo and his brothers Ned and Paul Oldham, but is generally the chief creator of the music. He has also been involved in musical projects and bands such as Box of Chocolates, Amalgamated Sons of Rest, The Anomoanon, The Boxhead Ensemble, Superwolf (with Matt Sweeney), Continental OP (with David Pajo), Current 93 (with David Tibet), and The Silver Jews (with David Berman).

Oldham has said that the Bonnie 'Prince' Billy moniker has many references. These include Bonnie Prince Charlie, an 18th century Jacobite; Billy the Kid, the 19th century American outlaw also known as William Bonney; and the American singer Nat King Cole. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Will+Oldham">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
