Born and Raised in Crown Heights Brooklyn, NY, in 1992, Dillon Cooper is doing exactly what heâ€™s set out to do " Conquer his dreams." He became a self-taught guitarist at age 8, and a college freshman by age 17 at one of the world's most sought after music schools, Berklee College of Music (the alma mater of John Mayer and Quincy Jones). Dillon has achieved a number of accolades to date, which he refers to as "fun times ..." but these are real achievements that attest to who he is: Guitarist, Rapper, Freestyle Roller (Aggressive Inline Skating), and aspiring Actor.

He recalls sitting alongside Swizz Beatz and Maino while recording as one of his most memorable times. Mr. Cooper is still in awe of being able to play the grand piano at the legendary Hit Factory Studios, which is now home to the Gibson Guitar Showroom, and to have played many of the guitars kept in their vault.

With Lyrical Skill and Finesse that are reminiscent of his idols such as The Notorious BIG, Tupac Shakur, and Big L, and musical talent built from studying the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Michael Jackson, and Bob Marley.

The two things that Dillon strives to do is stay RAD(Ridiculous and Driven) and Go TOO INFINITY AND BEYOND.
