There are several bands called the Tartans

1) A reggae/ska/rocksteady band: The Tartans were a rocksteady group who came together in 1967 in Kingston, Jamaica. The members were initially Prince Lincoln Thompson, Cedric Myton, Devon Russell and Lindberg Lewis.

Their recorded output included 'Far Beyond the Sun' for Duke Reid's Treasure Isle label, 'Dance All Night', 'What Can I Say', and six tracks recorded for Ken Lack's Caltone label: 'Awake The Town', 'Coming On Strong', 'It's Alright', 'Making Love', 'Save a Little Bread' and 'Solid as a Rock'.

'Lonely Heartaches' by The Clarendonians was incorrectly credited to 'The Tartons' [sic] when released in the UK on Crab.

After the group split, Thompson went on to form The Royal Rasses and Myton The Congos.



2) An indiepop band from Los Angeles, USA. According to the bio on their myspace-page:
 "lon had been in bands with both Jesse and Brian at different points in time, and Yvonne had been sitting at home playing bass along to Pastels records. We came together out of a love for jangle pop and bicycles."
They've released records on Yay! records and Cloudberry records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Tartans">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
