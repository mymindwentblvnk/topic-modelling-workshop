Mesmera was founded by Hrvoje Crnković and Petar Brkić, who worked on original songs from the very begining. 
Before their search for the rest of the band members, they've recorded 5 instrumentals that later became songs on the Emptiness Foreseen EP.
Second guitar player was found in Ivo Jerković, a longtime friend, who music wise fitted in perfectly. After half year of playing and creating new songs the band calls for Jerko Vičić, a young and perspective drummer whose playing style and music taste were just what the trio needed.
Last band member becomes Blaž Tomaš who came on Jerko's proposition and with his peculiar growl completes Mesmera's music mosaic.
The band entered the "Sound Kitchen" studio where they recorded vocals and completed their first EP Emptiness Foreseen, that was self-released in October 2011.
Mesmera recorded the video for the song Destined to Ruin that was released in July 2012.
In October 2012 drummer Jerko Vičić left the band due to personal reasons.
Soon the band announced two new members - drummer Josip Gruić and guitarist Joško Civadelić, both from the band Ereborn. 
In December 2013 Mesmera released their new single and video for the song Weight of a Sacrifice made exclusively for the upcoming StudioADI-s movie "Harbinger Down". 

Current line-up:

Petar Brkić - guitar and clean vocals
Hrvoje Crnković - bass
Ivo Jerković - guitar
Blaž Tomaš - growl vocals
Joško Civadelić - guitar
