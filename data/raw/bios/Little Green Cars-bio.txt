Little Green Cars are an Indie rock band from Dublin, Ireland.

Little Green Cars can trace their roots back to a former band, The Revolts, founded in the mid 2000s in Dublin, Ireland. O'Regan and Seaver-O'Leary (as well as former Little Green Cars member Utsav Lal) played with this band which subsequently grew on to become Little Green Cars upon its dissolution. Since signing professional terms, the band has toured America and the UK extensively, released three singles and supported Jake Bugg on his UK tour. The US portion of the 2013 tour included a live performance of their single Harper Lee on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. The band has played at the 2013 SXSW music festival in Austin, Texas and the Coachella music festival in California. The band is scheduled to perform at Lollapalooza 2013 in Chicago, IL. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Little+Green+Cars">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
