Sisyphean is a black/death metal band from Vilnius, Lithuania.

Formed in late 2012 under the Division name the band started as black/thrash metal act. The debut demo "Fall Of Nations‘‘ was released in spring 2013.  After some lineup changes the bands name was changed to Sisyphean  in 2014 which better represents the bands evolving ideas than the previous militaristic monicker.
The band once again entered the studio to record their new material. After debuting with live performances the band finally in 2014 released their debut EP  "Perpetual Cycle Of Absolution“, which was followed by the debut album Illusions of Eternity in 2017.
