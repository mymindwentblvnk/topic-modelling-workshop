Morgulian is a thrash metal band from Bremen, Germany. In 2006, guitarists Kevin and Steven met Christian (drums) at a party of a mutual friend. They struck up a conversation and, within a few weeks, decided to form a new band together out of frustration with their former bandsâ€™ situations. The band's  name became Morgulian, the musical direction a blend of elements of thrash and groove metal with Middle Eastern / Arabic influences.

In 2008, Victor joined Morgulian on bass, thus completing the band lineup.

In 2009, Morgulian began playing shows in and around Bremen.

In late 2009, the band name was changed to Rotten Sky. This decision was reached because the band members felt that the name "Morgulian" no longer suited the direction of their music. 

As of 2010, the band exists under the name of Rotten Sky.
