Woven Bones is a band from Austin, Texas USA. They somehow manage to blend garage rock, shoegaze, psychobilly, and noise rock to create a hard-driving, almost "hard rock" feel with super fuzzed out guitars and reverberated vocals. Influences include The Velvet Underground, The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Gun Club, and Link Wray.

Relocating to Austin from his roots in Florida in 2008, Andrew Burr slithered restlessly, reinventing Woven Bones from it's primordial Spacemen 3-blues/psyche jangle into a hard driving, meaner, louder, and altogether more vicious band that's turned into one of their city's new shining lights of creative energy. With most of the lineup changes settled firmly into place, woven bones orbit around central figure Andrew and his gang of nocturnal friends, Matt and James, who round out their sound into the chest-pounding monstrosity that they are today. Crossing the dark drawl of the cramps '76 demo-era sludge with Jesus and Mary Chain's demonic drum waves, and a dedication to simplicity as ravaging and throbbing as those buzzed out gospel recordings that Sonic Boom tried so desperately to recreate, Woven Bones are not here to put up a front. More likely, they'll be the ones to burn it all down. Their honest, neurotically-frayed, and manic songs conjure ominous impulses instantly on impact, and weave an intricate web of repetition that certainly carries them down the dark path to your soul. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Woven+Bones">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
