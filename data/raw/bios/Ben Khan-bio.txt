Ben Khan (born in 1992 in Oxfordshire) is a musician currently residing in London, United Kingdom. Khan makes dark electronic music, mixing neo-soul and R&B. Khan is signed to Blessed Vice.

Unlike most artists of his ilk, Khan’s primary instrument is guitar, and he claims listening to “mostly old-school” artists like B.B. King, Fleetwood Mac, and, Nirvana helped him develop his bluesy chops. He then turned to hip-hop (Earl Sweatshirt, Pusha T, and Danny Brown are current favorites), making beats on an MPC after hearing J Dilla, and putting them online. (“I had a couple of friends rap on those beats," he says, “but if Wu-Tang Clan were there, they would've absolutely killed it.”)
