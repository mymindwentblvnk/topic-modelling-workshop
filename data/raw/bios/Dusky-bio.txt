Previously existing as progressive / melodic house entity Solarity, Dusky are London based musicians Alfie Granger-Howell and Nick Harriman. As comfortable writing elegant orchestral pieces or stirring piano motifs as they are jackin' house and epic techno grooves, their diverse sounds are united by the duo's singular aim - to compose electronic music with depth, soul and originality. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dusky">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
