In the dark ages prior to 2005 there was no Scuurvy. Brisbane's pirate population sorely lacked suitable musical accompaniment by which to sail, loot, plunder and drink rum. It was a bleak time for all.

Fortunately the mighty Scuurvy crew soon arrived in port and began fiercly distributing their mighty, land lover stabbing variety of metal. The original crew faced many ferocious and cunning foes in a large number of battles and in 2007 they released an EP chronicling a very small portion of their perilous and battle filled voyages entitled Across the Seven Seas.

In 2008 during a particularly fierce battle Scuurvy lost a good portion of their crew, not even the mighty Rotgut McBroadsword could save their lives, however more nefarious sea dawgs with sufficient might were soon located and once again the jolly roger was raised, the cannons prepared, the anchor weighed and the rum barrel uncorked.

Course was set for the open seas, and now Scuurvy yet again embarks upon a journey of looting, plundering and burning small sea side villiages to the ground. Beware, Scuurvy is coming to a port near you. No quarter shall be given to those who stand in the way.
