Symmetry of the Void is a band that has been compiled from numerous projects from the Hungarian underground metal scene. Members of the bands Dusty Chopper, Conan’s first date, Ignotus Entropia and Effrontery have come together in the autumn of 2015 to create this project that pays homage to the world of old-school Gothenburg Melodic Death metal, in the liking of bands like Dismember, At The Gates, and old In Flames. The band’s first EP has been recorded during the summer of 2016 in Törökbálint, Hungary with the sole purpose of creating an old school sound that doesn’t resemble the modern polished metal records at all. Into The Encircling Chaos has been released on 10th September, 2016 and received positive feedback. The same year the band also started performing live, and has shared the stage with international acts such as Infected Rain (MD), Heaven Grey (LT) or Thell Barrio (MEX) since then. During the autumn of 2017, the band’s lineup finalized after a number of changes with the addition of Tibor Szokán (ex-Fire Conspiracy) and also started to record its first, self-titled full-length album, which was finally released on 14th January, 2018. We are looking forward to seeing everyone around the world in this new effort on our European and US tours! Don’t forget, we are always open to meeting new people, and hanging out, feel free to approach the band in any way possible, and join the global Void nation! Stay Metal!
