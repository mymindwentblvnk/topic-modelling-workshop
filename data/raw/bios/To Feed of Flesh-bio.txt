After the Cd, the band splitted, but, after a short time, three old members decide to work together again, changing the original name ( from God Save the hell to TO FEED OF FLESH) and changing genre.
Those three members are Fedaz (Drum), Raizor (Vocals) and Maverick (Guitar), they called the bass player Gawen, bass player of Necroptiksoul with Fedaz on Drum.
