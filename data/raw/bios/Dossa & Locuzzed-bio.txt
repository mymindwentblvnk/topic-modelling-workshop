Austrian production duo Dossa & Locuzzed are currently one of the hottest newcomers in Drum & Bass. When they teamed up in 2015 to write their first collaboration "Friday", they quickly got recognised by the biggest names in the scene.

Their peak-time anthem 'Hollow' was premiered by Camo & Krooked, being played on their radio show on radio FM4. A few months later their long-awaited debut EP 'Beatfunk' was released on Mainframe Recordings with DJ-support from Sub Focus, Culture Shock, Matrix & Futurebound, and Mistajam. 

The duo officially signed exclusively to Viper Recordings in April 2016, leading up to their debut single 'Only Way / Electric Boogie' on Viper’s sister label, Viper VIP. Although no strangers to the label, the duo has appeared on Viper's 'Drum & Bass Summer Slammers 2015' album with ‘Hollow’, and then again on 'The Sound of Drum & Bass 2016' with ‘Bad’.
