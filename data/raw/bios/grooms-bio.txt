Grooms is an indie rock/noise pop band from New York City, New York, United States. Till 2009, it was previously known as The Muggabears.

"The band's genesis may be purely millennial, but its music is firmly situated in the 1990s. Grooms' 2009 debut, Rejoicer, slightly recalls the shambling rawness of early Modest Mouse; for the follow-up, Prom, Grooms dive headlong into the sweeping erotic confusion that permeated the dreamier sphere of 90s alternative rock. They aren't the only band making such a maneuver, but Grooms' aims give off a whiff of vague danger, a static unease occasionally broken by detuned guitars and skins-smashing breakdowns," said Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork.

The original lineup:

Travis Johnson - guitars, vocals;
Emily Ambruso - bass guitar, vocals;
Jim Sykes - drums.
