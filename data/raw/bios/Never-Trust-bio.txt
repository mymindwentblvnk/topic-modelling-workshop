Never-Trust is a Groove/ Thrash/Hardcore band that was formed in 2010. The band suffered many line up changes,but now with many ideas and a strong line up we are ready to set the world afire!xaxa!!! We combine our favorite taste of violent music with groovy beats n' tempos and we are moving on a variety of lyrical themes. We now recorded our first songs for a demo and we are looking forward for many lives!
