There are 2 bands known as Glaciation.

1) black metal from France.

2) Glaciation started out as the more trancey alias of Al Azar, the collaboration between OrgaNik (Finland) and Echano (UK). However, it later on became their main alias. They also occasionally release music as Echano vs. OrgaNik.

They started together in 2002-2003, first remixing each other and doing one-off collaborations. After they realised they had very similar ideas about what kind of music they wanted to do they decided to keep producing music together. The joint venture has been continuing ever since. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Glaciation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
