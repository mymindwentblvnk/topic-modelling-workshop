The crossover band Angel Butcher was formed in the 80's in Araguari, Brazil (MG). AxBx's first lineup (1986-1990) released 4 demo tapes (one with Wagner Lamounier of Sarcófago fame as a special guest), played with bands from the Brazilian underground scene like Vodu, Genocídio, PxUxSx, Megatrash, Cirrhosis and others, then in the beginning of the 90's the band decided to call it quits.

In 2003, 13 years after the disband, drummer and founder Manu 'Joker' (U-Ganga, ex-Sarcófago, ex-Nuts) and guitarist Maurício 'Desecrator' (Krofader, ex-John No Arms, ex–Nuts, ex-Cuspindo Marimbondo, who also played with AxBx in the 80's) decided to reunion with the help of their friend Édson 'Lunaris' (Loucomotive) on the bass. Basically, the propose was having fun playing old songs and some covers, but the old chemistry was flamed and new songs were made.

The "reunion show" was in February 2004 in Uberaba/MG with the band Deadly Side and after one year they played on the same city opening for hardcore bands like Calibre 12 e Lobotomia with their final lineage with Kim 'Beermosh' (ex-John No Arms, ex-Cuspindo Marimbondo as bass/vocals) and Wesley 'Decrethä Abducto' (Olorum, ex-Seu Juvenal, ex-Sonoridade Agressiva on the second guitar).

Besides working and playing with their own side-projects, the members from AxBx released their newest demo entitled The Angels Are Back (Independent/2006).

Produced by Angel Butcher and Líbio (Olorum, Nada A Lembrar, DCV) on "Guzerá Estúdio", the new demo brings the new version of the old song "Final Breath" and three new songs ("Chair Mosh", "The Angels Are Back" and "Control") proving that the angels still have much stuff to do it with their metal-core/crossover with heavy and well mood lyrics.
