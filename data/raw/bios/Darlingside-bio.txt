Darlingside is an American indie folk band from Boston, MA. The band consists of Don Mitchell, Auyon Mukharji, Harris Paseltiner, and David Senft.

Describing themselves as “string-rock”, the band started up in 2009 and quickly took hold of New England’s musical imagination. Playing over 100 shows during their first year of touring, the band created a seamless, exhilarating sound at the intersection of rock, classical, and folk music. Their self-produced six-song EP 1 earned high praise for its craftsmanship and originality, and their brand new subscription album Pilot Machines was released in 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Darlingside">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
