Essie Jain is English singer-songwriter born and raised in London.

Jain has released four studio albums worldwide; her first full-length record, We Made This Ourselves, was critically acclaimed and drew comparisons to the British singers Sandy Denny and Vashti Bunyan. In 2011, she started her own label and released Until the Light of Morning, an album of original lullabies for parent and child.

Her third album, All Became Golden, is an audiovisual project and the creative vision of Jain and filmaker Natalie Johns. It marked the dawn of a more expansive and joyful direction with Jain's songwriting.

In January 2015, Jain released To Love, an album of modern chants, movements and meditations, and a journey began to bring these songs of the heart out into the world through healing workshops, retreats and live accompaniment for yoga classes.

She currently lives in New York with her husband and longterm musical collaborator Patrick Glynn.
