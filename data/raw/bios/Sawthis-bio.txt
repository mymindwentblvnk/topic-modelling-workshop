Sawthis is an Italian thrash metal band.

Born in 1997 under the name of Anestesia, Sawthis was founded by Michele Melchiorre, Adriano Quaranta and Devis Ercole. The band recorded "The Seven Lies" demo in 2001 which led to interest from audiences and the press.

Their second demo "Istinct" was released in 2002, generating good reviews from the national and European press. They began to tour with many established bands across the thrash metal and death metal genre, as well as more mainstream acts.

"The Seven Lies" and "Istinct" were reissued in 2003 and the band signed a record deal with the Roman Temple Of Noise. Their debut album "Fusion" was released in April 2006. In 2007 the video of "Beyond The Bound" appeared on the web. This was the band's first official video and was inspired by the movie Clockwork Orange.

In 2009, the band entered the studio again to recird their second full-length named "EGOD", with Paolo Ojetti (singer and producer from the band Infernal Poetry) as artistic producer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sawthis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
