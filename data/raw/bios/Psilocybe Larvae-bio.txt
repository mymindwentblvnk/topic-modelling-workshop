The story of PSILOCYBE LARVAE started in 1996, in the Russian city of Vyborg, when Vitaly "Larv" Belobritsky (voc/git), Denis Vinogradov (git), Oleg Peshkichev (bass), and Eugene Ushakov (drums) formed the band to indulge their passion for melodic and haunting death/dark metal.
PSILOCYBE LARVAE entered the studio in 2000 to record their 1st full-length "Stigmata". This self-released effort garnered some favourable feedback, including the "demo of the month" award in Germany's Legacy magazine, so Black Side Productions decided to re-release "Stigmata" on CD in 2001. The 2nd album "Agony" followed in 2003. Having gained good critical response, both albums were re-released by Russian major label CD-Maximum for CIS states in 2005. 
After headlining the Ukrainian "Triple Interaction" tour 2006, PSILOCYBE LARVAE entered into a studio in 2007 to record their 3d album "Non-existence". It was released in 2008 Russia, Ukraine and Belarus via Mazzar Records. In March the band headlined a Russian "Non-existent" tour to support the new album.
During 2008 the collective continued to promote "Non-existence" by doing shows in Russia and taking part in a Belarus tour named "Creative Breath of Death".
In 2009 PSILOCYBE LARVAE have signed a deal with Dark Harvest Records (USA) for the "Non-existence" worldwide release.
Having made quite a reputation within the underground with released 3 full-length albums Psilocybe Larvae had finished the recording of a new album "The Labyrinth Of Penumbra" and looking forward to bringing their music to the world.
Being active on a live circuit PSILOCYBE LARVAE shared the stage with such bands as ANATHEMA, SADIST, SWALLOW THE SUN, NORTHER, VESANIA and others.
