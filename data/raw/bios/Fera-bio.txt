4) Fera is a experimental / folk / indie from Chico, CA. Fera was the cutest kitten in the litter with the loudest meow. Fera uses traditional instruments to make (modern/ unique/ forward-thinking/ iconoclastic) music, driven by (dynamic/ rhythmic/ percussive) guitar work and lyrics rich in imagery. Fera is the dark but sweet marrow of indie folk! Fera writes songs with deftly oiled words that lubricate the gears of even the rustiest of hearts. Random, ramble, mumble, fumble, rare." - Kim, Cobby, Sean, Jody and Megan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fera">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
