Jig-Ai is a Czech goregrind band from Prague, that formed in 2005.

Jig-Ai play a rather original style of goregrind, mixing the old school goregrind genre with various other styles, such as death metal. The most notable characteristic of the band's music is the frequent use of both blast beat and D-beat drum patterns, pig squeals and death growls, and down-tuned guitars and bass. They frequently use ero-guro, a style of hentai in which anime females are featured being mutilated and dismembered in a sexually appealing way, in both their lyrics and imagery. The band's name actually refers to Jigai, a form of ritual suicide which was once performed by women in Japan.
