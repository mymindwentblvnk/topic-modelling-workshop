There at least six bands called Basilisk:

1) One man Black Metal project from the UK with Vintyr playing all instruments. Bristol's BASILISK emerged in 2003 with the 'Blackened Royalty' cassette distributed by Eternal Darkness Productions. The same concern was set to issue the 'War...Pain...Despair' album in 2004. However, these recordings would be shelved, the material subsequently projected for future release on singles. BASILISK put out the 'Vintyrhell' demo the same year. Vintyr of BASILISK also operates ABANDON, releasing an eponymous promotion tape.

2) Black metal band from Nagoya, Japan, with one demo released (Kyo-Ja)

3) A thrash metal band from Chile with two demos released.

4) A psychedelic trance DJ from Toronto, Canada.  DJ profile here
