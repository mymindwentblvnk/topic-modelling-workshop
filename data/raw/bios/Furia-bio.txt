6. Hard rock band from Madrid that only recorded an EP "Lady rock" in the year 1987. They participated in the VIII Rock Trophy Villa de Madrid (1985) remaining as finalists with Sangre azul and Esfinge, and were awarded the third put with the themes "Look for me" and "The strong will win." When they released their first single, there was a printing error and they were mistakenly called Animal Fury, so the band continued with the new name until they changed it again in 1987, first to Furia and then to Pleasure.

NOTE that bass player Winston appeared as special collaboration on the back cover of their single.

Not to be confused with Furia Animal, a Melodic Power Metal band from Alicante. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Furia">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
