Men at Large was an American R&B group from Cleveland, Ohio, whose members, David Tolliver and Jason Chapman, frequently self-referenced their obesity. They scored several US hits in the mid-1990s and were discovered by the late soul singer Gerald Levert. 
(2) R&B duo Men at Large arrived during the tail-end of the new jack swing era with strong support and creative input from fellow Clevelander Gerald Levert. Expressive vocalists Dave Tolliver and Jason Champion began with Atlantic subsidiary EastWest and released two albums for the label: Men at Large (1992) and the relatively mellow One Size Fits All (1994). They reached Billboard's R&B chart with seven singles from those titles, including the Top Ten hits "Use Me" and "So Alone," the latter of which was a ballad addressed to Tolliver's mother, who had recently passed. Third and fourth Men at Large albums were issued through independent labels during the late '90s and 2000s. After the duo split, Champion recorded contemporary gospel material and was featured on high-profile albums by A-listers Kirk Franklin and Deitrick Haddon. Tolliver popped up on tracks by Rome and 8Ball & MJG and released solo albums in 2009 and 2015. In 2016, with Edgar "Gemini" Porter in place of Champion, Tolliver reactivated Men at Large through the single "Date Night." ~ Andy Kellman
