Finisher is a metal band from Lawrence and Boston, Massachusetts. Formed in 2007, with the original lineup consisting of Ryan Bowie, Bill Kurtz, Joe Streeter. With this lineup they released a demo EP and an LP entitled "Socially Dead" on Witch Trial Records supported by two full US tours and one east coast tour. In mid 2010, drummer Joe Streeter left the band siting personal reason, and the band welcomed Derrick Flanagin as its new backbone. After another east coast tour, the trio entered the studio in early 2011 to record an untitled LP to be released sometime later in the year.
