Initially a guitarist working with dub, rock and funk bands, Inner Space's Ian Fletcher began experimenting with samplers, sequencers and analogue keyboards with the aim of incorporating them along with live instruments into his music. Fusing together diverse global influences including Indian, Egyptian, Celtic and African styles, his tunes feature dub and funk rhythms laced together with atmospheric keyboard and guitar work. Alothough a one-man band in the studio, Inner Space becomes a five-piece lineup for live work, featuring bass, drums, precussion, wind instruments and guitar, along with sequenced synth lines and samples, which leaves room for a lot of inprovisation in their sets. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inner+Space">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
