Aerial View began in 1993 when songwriters Aaron MacMillan, Dwayne Stearns, and drummer Jerry Ward reorganized the band "Oracle" with bassist Radu Filip. The style of music in early Aerial View retained the metal edge from the Oracle era and leaned toward a sound described by one writer as "Arena Rock". Eventually, drummer Jerry Ward left the band to pursue other musical interests and Rob Santello joined the band. Toward the final stages of recording their debut album, Dwayne Stearns left the band to pursue a calling to the ministry in Sonora, California. In 2002, Aerial View added guitarist Steve Wilburn to replace Dwayne and finish the work on the cd. Veteran producer and engineer Ralph Stover (The 77's) was brought in to mix and master the cd. Steve left the band in early 2007 and the search was on to find a replacement. In Februrary 2008, we brought lead guitarist Jeff Askew into the band to complete the current lineup. Aerial View continues to write new material with a hard rock and progressive edge that reflects the various influences and styles of the band members. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aerial+View">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
