Pale King was started by Jonny (Wombbath, Ashcloud, Ursinne, Henry Kane) and Håkan (Wombbath, Skineater) in 2016 with an aim to play melodic death metal with an old school feel. Shortly after recruiting Hannah and Jon Pale King recorded a demo that lead to a record deal with Soulseller Records. Work on the debut album was started and will be out in the first half of 2017.
