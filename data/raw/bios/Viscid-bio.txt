1) Viscid is a d-beat band from Australia



2) Tymoteusz Cypla, also known as Viscid, always has been interested in 'dark side' of electronic music. Formerly trance, afterwards tribal progressive house, and now a little bit more severe - minimal techno and ambient. However, he doesn't rule out that he may evolve into totally other genres. Original rhythmical patterns, diligent build-up, sometimes hair-raising sounds, these are the main features that distinguish his production amongst others. Recently he works actively in a digital label, which he founded with friends - Phatt Sounds. Its releases are published on netlabels common - totally free! His passion for darkness isn't limited to music, that is why David Lynch, Darren Aronofsky or David Cronenberg are his favourites from cinematic field. From musical inspirations he points producents like: James Holden, Murcof, Seph, Coil, Shpongle just to name a few.
