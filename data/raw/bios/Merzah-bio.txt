Merzah formed the last quarter of 2005 in York County, South Carolina (an offset suburb of Charlotte, North Carolina). They immediately recorded a short demo and began performing at the beginning of 2006. Now, Merzah is stronger than ever and ready to conquer the world.

2006 saw the release of a self produced EP entitled In the Trenches. This EP pushed the band to the forefront of the regional metal scene, and still continues to sell to this day. The band took initiative from this success and has since played 250+ shows from New York to Florida, as well as participating in two “mini tours” in NC, SC, VA, GA and FL.

While weathering the music scene and its propensity for tight pants and hair care products, Merzah’s style slowly developed into what can be considered “Aggressive Progressive.” This style can be sampled in their newest release, an EP called Existence Denied. This EP was once again totally self produced, and was released in February of 2009. It continues to sell well at shows, and is available for download through major online retailers.

Currently, Merzah just finished recording a new EP with Billy Seals (Sanctity). The band hopes that this recording of brand new, unheard material will be the one to put it over the top. So in 2010 and beyond, keep yours eyes and ears open and unrestrained for the genius that is Merzah.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Merzah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
