Adorn is a romantic blackgaze project from the UK. 

Romanticism, beauty, chivalry... these are the words used to describe the dream world of Adorn by its central protagonist, Coeur Loyale.

In 2012 Loyale began composing for his project Adorn with the intention of expressing the spirit of an era which lingers on in our modern world as a dying fable of older days, when values like chivalry and virtuousness were the highest expression of all earthly character, and when art in all its beauty and luster was a noble endeavour extolling the finest aspects of our physical and theoretical universe through the artist craftsman himself and his creative vision.

Loyale & his courtiers seek to venerate these eternal ideas in question and the lost sense of art as a vehicle for change and discovery. It is here henceforth that Coeur Loyale begins his quest to marry the blackgazer genre of contemporary music and the grandest ideals of the past to bring to life Adorn in our present times for the consideration of those who dream, and for those who yearn for the age of courtly life and high art.

Debut EP "Grace" is set to be released by Khrysanthoney in 2014.
