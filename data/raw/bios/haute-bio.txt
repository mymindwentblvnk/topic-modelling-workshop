A French duo halfway between electronic R&B and soulful pop, Anna Majidson and Blasé were meant to be.

Both born in France but raised on the other side of the Atlantic, the pair cultivates the same cultural background, made of a French heritage and teenage years fed with the American pop culture; especially hip-hop and R&B.

It was Haute's fate that they would cross paths in Montréal. In 2013, both decided to join McGill University to study music and philosophy among other subjects. Same curriculum, same influences, by chance they would even live on the same street ... but as in every good 2010s fairy tale, Anna and Blasé would eventually meet through the Internet, thanks to an ad that Blasé had posted on a Facebook page dedicated to McGill's musicians. It's in Paris that they would actually meet in real life, once again by accident.

The name Haute is a reflection of "their roots but also a certain grandeur and elegance a la française while staying relevant to the English-speaking environment". It also stands for the confluence of various influences, musical genres, cultures and talents. Blasé and Anna work closely together on every track: writing, composing and recording in perfect symbiosis. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/haute">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
