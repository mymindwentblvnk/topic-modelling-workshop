Fulton Lights are one of several projects masterminded by Brooklyn-based singer, composer, and musician Andrew Spencer Goldman, who has also recorded as leader of the groups John Guilt and Maestro Echoplex. For Fulton Lights, Goldman assembled an eclectic variety of musicians -- among them players who have worked with the Walkmen, Wilco, DÃ¤lek, Ida, the Beauty Pill, and Grenadine -- to create a suite of beautiful, ghostly songs in which acoustic pianos and string samples float over muted hip-hop beats as Goldman's soulful, whispery tenor shares tales of life in the city of New York. Fulton Lights' self-titled debut album was recorded over the space of three years, with multi-instrumentalists and producers Rob Christiansen and Steve Silverstein serving as Goldman's prime allies in the studio and a core of nine other musicians (many of whom had worked with Goldman in the past) joining in. In early 2007, Fulton Lights was issued as a cooperative release by the Android Eats and Catbird Records labels. The album quickly earned a fistful of enthusiastic reviews, and Goldman began making plans to assemble a live version of Fulton Lights to promote the record on the road. --All Music Guide <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fulton+Lights">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
