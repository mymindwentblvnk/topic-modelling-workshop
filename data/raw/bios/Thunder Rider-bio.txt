Thunder Rider has composed quite an extensive repertoire of songs based on the belief that a true attempt at originality and versatility will be their key to success. The operatic vocal style, the soaring melodic and lightning guitar leads, the haunting orchestral keyboards, the angelic female back up vocals, accompanied by the thunderous combination of bass and drums, generate all the electricity required to power Thunder Rider. Project Members Front row: Pat Hammer, John Blackwing, Bruce Corian Back row: Mark Wildword, Roberto Deus, Nathalie Lacourse, Luc Dufresne, Bryan Clarke, Nathalie Dauphin During the launch of Thunder Riders independent self-produced debut album, live portions were filmed for the video Death to Death, the albums title track. The video was aired several times on Musique Plus and Much Music (Canadian music video stations), and on Rock Stage, a highly rated local music entertainment television show. The video was also included in an Underground U.S.A. Music Magazine compilation, to be broadcast in 39 countries on the Super Channel. Upon invitation, Thunder Rider visited Italy on a promotional tour playing to a very receptive and enthusiastic audience.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thunder+Rider">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
