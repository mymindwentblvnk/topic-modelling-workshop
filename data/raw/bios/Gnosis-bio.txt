Gnosis (South Florida, US)

Gnosis delivers a fusion of Black and Death Metal, reminiscent of the late 80's Mediterranean genre, while incorporating their own styles. This sound is complemented with the influence of advanced dark magick, mythology, the obscure, hidden knowledge and mystical enlightenment.
