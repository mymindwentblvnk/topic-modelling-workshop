GosT is a synthwave producer from Texas who specializes in a unique blend of synthwave and horror, often referred as 'slasherwave' by his fans. Having put out multiple releases through his own bandcamp page, he has released music through record label Werkstatt Recordings. Most recently, GosT's debut and second album, 'Behemoth' and 'Non Paradisi' respectively, have been released under the predominately metal record label Blood Music. His third album, 'Possessor', was also released under Blood Music. While GosT's early works focused more on the horror aspect of his music, his more recent works have evolved into a style and sound truly unique to this dark master of synthwave. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gost">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
