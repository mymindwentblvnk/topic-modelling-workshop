"Монгол Шуудан" means "Mongolian Postal Service" in Mongolian language. This unusual choice is explained the band vocalist Valeri Skoroded very simply: the band was standing at a bus stop by a Soyuzpechat booth and their eyes were caught by fancy postage stamps with exotic words "Монгол Шуудан" on them. (Note: Mongolian is written in Cyrillic alphabet.)

The group's music was mostly anti-governmental, pro-anarchist in its message, with the group identifying themselves with the Black Army of the Russian Civil War More accurately Mongol Shuudan associated themselves with the Makhnovshchina, the peasant-anarchist guerilla army led by Nestor Makhno.

Many of their songs are modernized versions of anarchist civil war songs. Some of their songs include "Commissar," "Chekist," "Freedom or Death," "Sabbath on the Bald Mountain" , and so forth. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the group has continued to produce music, much of which is available on their website.

The band has performed over 100 shows and toured Europe, Israel, and all of the Russian Federation.
