Christ's Flesh was a death/doom metal band from Elblag, Warmia-Masuria, Poland. Formed in 1991 in Elbląg by guitarist Tomasz Sumiński and drummer Tomasz Pietrulewski. Vocalist Rafał Ossowski and bassist Krzysztof Andrearczyk were later added. They played together for the first time at the Klub Garnizonowy in Mierosławskiego Street.

In April 1992, the group recorded a demo, embracing a death metal sound, which received good reviews from underground metal fanzines despite its substandard sound quality.

In early-1993, second guitarist Dominik Kadłubowski from the punk band Abstrakcja was introduced, along with keyboardist Daniel Kruszewski. In June, the new formation entered the Warrior Studio in Gdynia to record their second demo. They sent the songs to Bestial Records and Morbid Noizz Productions, but were never released due to financial problems. In July, they appeared at the Wegorzewo festival, taking part in the band contest.

Christ's Flesh didn’t start working on new material until the following year. In July 1994, they appeared at the Wegorzewo festival again. They eventually, broke-up after some disagreements with Morbid Noizz, which didn’t publish the new demo until spring 1995. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Christ%27s+Flesh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
