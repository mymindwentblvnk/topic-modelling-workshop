There are three artists  known as Jet Jaguar.

1. Jet Jaguar is  downbeat producer Michael Upton. Born and raised in Wellington, New Zealand, Michael has been making music since 1991, when he was inspired by a friend's mum's MIDI set-up. Inspired by 1970s dub producers and hip-hop he sees no point in emulating them, instead borrowing aspects of the dubspace programme to pan, echo and stretch space and time.

2. Formed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 2001, Jet Jaguar is Charles Van de Kree, Trisha St. James, and Joey Mach. Named after a robot in a Godzilla movie, the group combines the high energy of punk and the heavy riffing of metal with the robotic, technology-laden sound of industrial and the drifting dreamscapes of ambient. Obsessed with visions of science-fiction apocalypse, the groupâ€™s songs are terminally preoccupied with aeronautics, interstellar exploration, robotics, cloning, androidology, virtual reality, biomolecular mutation and nuclear genocide.

3. As part of Monsta Island Czars, Percy Carey (AKA MF Grimm, GM Grimm, The Grimm Reaper, Grimm) has used the names Jet Jaguar and Superstar Jet Jaguar.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jet+Jaguar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
