Malevolent atmospheres, threatening riffs with low-end fuzz, shuddering rhythms and haunting melodies through a thunderous voice. These are the elements that Obscura Insania uses to create an ominous environment throughout their repertoire. Their music contains prose concerning existentialism, insurrection, revenge, forgetfulness, and fear. Reflecting a dark vision of humanity.

Obscura Insania was formed in Caracas, Venezuela, by Luis Osorio, Ivan Torres Barroyetta, and Renzo Lucena. After developing the genre Stoner Doom Metal in Spanish, the band is releasing their debut album “Sodoma” in June 2016.

The band’s name (“Dark Insanity” in Spanish) is an expression of their ideology about life and death. The word Obscura literally translates to “dark”, however it also represents the somber and morbid character of our world. Insania, literally “insanity”, alludes to a disorder of reason, and is a reference to the self-destructive lifestyle pervasive in human society for centuries.

Obscura Insania’s debut album was baptized under the name Sodoma (“Sodom” in English) to create an analogy to the dark world of today, with cities and societies metaphorically and physically destroyed by the actions of its inhabitants. The album, while diverse, maintains an important consistency throughout, transitioning from a tense atmosphere to a tragedy of unknown consequences.
