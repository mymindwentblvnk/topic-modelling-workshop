Anthesteria is an audio-visual one man project from St. Petersburgh, Russia, started by musician and composer George Thieme in March 2001, after several efforts with other projects and bands. 

The sound of Anthesteria can be classified as blend of dark ambient, neoclassical darkwave and gothic music. The project's first album, titled "Beyond Nimbostratus", was issued in 2003 in only 50 copies but soon caught attention of world's dark scene VIPs, such as Peter Andersson (raison d'Ãªtre). It was then followed by a re-issue and single titled "I Killed", a release based on a filicide's confession with an enhanced video track. 2005 saw the European release of the second full-length album titled "Nebesnaya" which sounded different from earlier Anthesteria's works and  featured one track with vocals, performed by Pavel "MRZ" from Majdanek Waltz.

The two main ideas concerned with Anthesteria are: travel and feelings. Music acts like a guide for different places in this World and beyond, somewhere in subconsciousness. Feelings, as well as emotions are deeply connected with travels, allowing you to be involved in what's going on. 
Anthesteria use a multi-perceptional approach. This means that albums are supported with photographs, videos and other multimedia. Among rare projects Anthesteria uses aromatization for CDs. 

Sometimes, but not often, live performances happen.

The word "Anthesteria" comes from the Ancient Greek spring celebration, a part of Dionysian rituals, devoted to spirits of the dead ancestors and to the flowers, where their souls should rest. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anthesteria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
