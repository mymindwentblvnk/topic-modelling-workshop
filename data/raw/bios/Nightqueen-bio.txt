Nightqueen was founded at the end of 2004 in Genk, Belgium. 
Songwriter and guitarist Rex Zeco wanted to break the illusion that heavy metal is only popular in metalminded quarters; he wanted to compose a kind of metal for everyone. The formula was simple ... strong guitarriffs in 80’s style, upgraded with the modern metalbeats and a melodic songmelody with catchy tunes that stay in the music fan ’s head for a long time. 

Rex had the help of Hi-Dee, who assisted him with writing the right lyrics: well- considered lyrics about love, understanding and social abuses; interweaved with mystic and fantasy. The first song they wrote was “Queen of the Night”. And that title sounded good for a band name as well, thus, ‘Nightqueen’ was born. 

The band name has a double meaning : first of all the queen of the night; the never ending story of a simple housewife – sick and tired of the daily toil - who is transforming into the mistress of metal. Secondly, ‘Nightqueen’ is a given name for a big bat. That’s why the band chose for a bat as their symbol. Most of the lyrics also take place overnight; something that is very typical for Nightqueen. 

The first years were a real hell. Musicians came and left. It was very hard to find musicians with the right professional spirit to let the project succeed. The band reformed a few times before the right line-up was found: 6 talented musicians who all have the same goal ... : to bring Nightqueen as far as possible in the musicworld. And now the Nightqueenstory will start by unleashing our thunder to the crowd. 
Hail to our Majesty, the queen and her knights !!!
