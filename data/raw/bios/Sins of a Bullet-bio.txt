Bio:
Sins Of A Bullet started about 10 years ago with Alex and Kelby, originally they both played guitar, and this was a Bluegrass band. As years progressed and through multiple lineup changes S.O.A.B became a Rock N' Roll band and Alex jumped on the drum set. Then in 2009 when the band was once again just Alex and Kelby they recruited local Death Metal vocalist Brett Larsen. Since then the band has been producing nothing but very HEAVY and very VIOLENT music. Once Brett joined they began searching for a bassist, no one could keep up with them other than Nikolas Evans. Nik was the lead guitarist and drummer for many of Brett's past Death Metal bands. S.O.A.B's first album titled, "ETERNAL SILENCE", was released on the day of the "rapture" May 21st 2011. Since the release of "ETERNAL SILENCE", Sins Of A Bullet has began working on new music with their new bassist, Brandon Hunter; moving Nik to guitar with Kelby. S.O.A.B has just finished recording their new EP "A Devil To Embrace", RELEASE DATE SET FOR JUNE 29TH, 2012, until then you can PRE-ORDER (http://sinsofabullet.bandcamp.com/) or watch lyric videos at our youtube page (http://www.youtube.com/soabofficial).
