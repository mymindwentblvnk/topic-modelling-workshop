Skyggegjemsel started up in September 2006 in Stavanger, Norway, as just a "jam-band".
After receiving some new blood, they were then known as 'Skyggegjemsel', which directly translated to English means 'Hiding in shadows'.
Skyggegjemsel is a word from the medieval ages for mirrors, as they believed that their souls could be trapped inside mirrors.
The band had their first concert at Klepp in November 2006, after playing together for roughly 4 weeks. Though it wasn't the best of performances, they impressed the audiences at UKM.
The band was in studio in June 2007 and released their first EP "God's Enemy" around June 18th.

Later the band released a new EP called "Lords of the mist" that lead Skyggegjemsel into a darker path of Black/doom metal.

Danny Johannesen - Vocals

Jan Vika - Guitar
