Congi are two British producers from Nottingham, Gaz Frost & Tulip, associated with the Chord Marauders collective. The duo met at a friend’s studio during the early years of the Nottingham's underground electronic music scene. Boasting a roster of artists and crews who have defined the image of the city over the past decade, the two have spent the last couple of years carving their own space within the city’s furnishings, fusing their separate identities into one sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Congi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
