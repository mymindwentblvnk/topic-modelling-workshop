Exquisite Ending take the many diverse sides of the Black Metal genre, and seek to combine them into one darkened sound that emanates the influences of old while embracing the new.

Their songs take the listener to a dark place, conveying an introspective self-loathing catastrophe of melodic movement and unrelenting rawness.

Exquisite Ending's debut album "The Pain Of Passing I embrace" is a 10 track album due to be released on Hibernacula Records on May 20th.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Exquisite+Ending">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
