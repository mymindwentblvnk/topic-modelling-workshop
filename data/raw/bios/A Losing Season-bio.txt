A Losing Season is a metal band from Budapest, Hungary that was formed in 2004. Fronted by two vocalists the six-piece draws influence from many sub-genres of heavy metal keeping their music diverse and energetic. After releasing an EP titled To Whom It May Concern in early 2007, touring extensively and sharing the stage with Killswitch Engage and As I Lay Dying among others, their self-released debut album, Delirium Provides The Safest Shelter came out in the spring of 2010.

Nedo, Zsolt and Dani decided to form a band in their high school years, and started out with playing Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden and AC/DC songs. While constantly looking for fellow musicians to fill in the post of drummer and vocalist, the three guitarists began writing their own music. In 2004, after they went to a neverLAND gig, they got in touch with the vocalist/guitarist, Maci and asked him to join A Losing Season. By this time the influence of progressive, death metal and a bit of hardcore grew stronger, thus finding a drummer who is able to tackle the often unconventional rhythmic structures and keep up the fast tempo was far from easy. After recruiting Stavi in 2006, A Losing Season began working on their debut EP and started giving their first shows. In 2007, with Bálint (who appeared on the EP as a guest vocalist) coming aboard to share vocal duties with Maci, the line-up of A Losing Season became complete.

Line up:
Balázs Medve - vocals
Bálint Bokodi - vocals (Gloaming)
Zsolt Juhász - guitars
Dániel Kabai - guitars
György Nedoluha - bass (Suffering, Vale of Tears)
Dániel Kovács - drums (Gloaming)
