24-year-old Karlis Griffin hails from the West Side of Chicago. He has been producing music since the age of 13 and DJing since 20, heading the 'Flight Muzik' clique of producers.

DJ Diamond's footwork productions show much more restraint and economy of groove than some others; his sample choices show a love of g-funk, soul, classic and contemporary hiphop, most notably Kanye West (who was himself inspired by Chicago's scene).
