Saint of Disgrace is a melodic death-metal band formed in 2009. Originally the band drew it's influences from viking mythology, but has changed it's style to a more melodic direction, adding keyboards and clean female vocals to their arsenal.
Saint of Disgrace has reached it's current form during the past year, adding almost progressive nuances to their straightforward melodic death-metal set. The best qualities of the band are their "Beauty and the Beast" style of singing, switching between beautiful, clean female vocals and brutal death-metal growls in relation to their straightforward and powerful style of melodic death-metal.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Saint+of+disgrace">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
