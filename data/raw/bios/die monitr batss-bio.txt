A spin-off from the formidable blues-punk of the Gossip, Olympia, WA's Die Monitr Batss feature that group's guitarist Nathan as its singer/guitarist. Unlike the Gossip, however, the sound of Die Monitr Batss - which also includes saxophonist Nate; guitarist/singer Brace; drummer Chris; and Lana, also a singer - owes more to no wave and art punk influences like Mars and Teenage Jesus & the Jerks. In 2002, the group released a split 7" with the like-minded Chromatix on the GSL imprint, and the following year issued the Spread Your Legs Release the Bats 7" and Youth Controllerzz full-length on Dim Mak.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Die+Monitr+Batss">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
