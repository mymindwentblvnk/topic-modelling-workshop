USA brutal death metal band Meathook, the love child of guitarist/singer Mr. Meathook and bass player Ogre Meat began in the frosty days of late Fall 2002. Since the creation of the four-piece onslaught, Meathook has managed to record their first release "Holy Shit", a six-song demo that's sure to make your bowels quiver in fits of excremental rage. Currently Meathook is sitting in the barracks in preparation for crossing the Napanee River to rape and pillage their way across North America. Keep your ears peeled for the thunderous clap that will erupt from their prosteriers in a city near you!
