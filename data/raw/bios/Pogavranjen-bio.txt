Pogavranjen was founded in the winter of year 2008 by long time friends Nerast & Lmf in Croatia's capital Zagreb. It was concieved mainly as a black metal entity, but over the years band took their sound to somewhat more psychedelic and avantgarde level, with strong nihilistic lyrical flavor, yet grasping firmly to cold and punishing roots. Still, they are concidered to be outcasts within their native scene, emphasising their scorn and disgust towards the stagnant, even regressive nature of traditionalism in black metal scene nowadays. Such public statements, plus the fact that they refuse to play concerts with vast majority of black metal bands have not been overly welcome, so it resulted in band being marginalized and their potential audience not so evenly divided. Often collaborating with people completly outside of metal aesthetical dogmas, band draws their fallowing much more from noise, ambient and progressive oriented audience.
