There are 3 known bands with the name Infester:

1) The first formed in Seattle in 1992. They released a four song demo that year and a full length, "To the Depths, In Degradation" in 1994. Haven't been heard from since. The album has been since pressed on cassette by Headsplit Records and remastered through Martyrdom Productions. The drummer has been in several other bands including Seattle's current death metal leaders, Drawn and Quartered.  See also: Threnodist

2) The second formed in Eskilstuna, Sweden in 1991. That year saw the release of their only output, a 5 song demo. Band played classic Swedish death metal. They dissolved rather quickly and members went on to other bands such as Crypt of Kerberos and Pain of Salvation.

3) Infester is a pathological goregrind project from Russellville, Arkansas, USA. Formed in 2002 by Bobby Maggard and Hector Aartiquez with the intent to play old-style goregrind in the vein of Last Days of Humanity, Necrony, Regurgitate, Xysma, etc. Most of their releases came out on Bobby's label, Regurgitated Stoma Stew Productions.
