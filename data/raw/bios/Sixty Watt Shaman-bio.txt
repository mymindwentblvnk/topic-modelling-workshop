Sixty Watt Shaman is an American rock band known for incorporating hard rock with blues, southern rock, doom rock, punk rock and metal influences, originally based out of Eldersburg, Baltimore County, Montgomery County, and Montgomery Village, Maryland.

The band formed in 1996 and recorded and released their first studio album in 1998. The band last recorded in 2002. The last official band tour was in late 2002 through January 2003; but, the band has made several reunion appearances since, including Desertfest Berlin and Desertfest London in 2014. The band continues with appearances at festival events in the US and Europe, and in 2017 are writing and recording new music for release.

A potent force in the stoner rock field, Sixty Watt Shaman succeeded due to a more varied songwriting approach than many of their contemporaries. Seed Of Decades has some of the standard influences of the genre (i.e. Kyuss, Fu Manchu,early Black Sabbath and other 70s heavy rock bands), blended into a surprisingly original-sounding record. They can throw down with the best of them for sheer heaviness, but also realize the importance of subtlety and mood in their music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sixty+Watt+Shaman">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
