There are two artists named White Oak.
1. White Oak is an atmospheric black metal band from Utrecht, the Netherlands. Founded as a studioproject by HÃ¦resiarch Sr. and W. Damiaen back in 2008, they evolved into a full band in 2010, adding Mercur and Vuygh to the line-up. The band shares members with Laster, Sea of Trees, 1774, Omninihilist, Willoos and Evagatio Mentis. Their first demo "Contouren van het Niets" can be downloaded for free (incl. artwork & lyrics) from their website.

In April 2013, Mercur left the band as a result of differing priorities and practical factors, although he would still be involved in the release of the second demo, for which he had already recorded his lead guitar material. Galgenvot, who had been on stage with White Oak several times performing backing vocals, came to replace Mercur as the band's full-time lead guitarist, completing the band's line up once more.
