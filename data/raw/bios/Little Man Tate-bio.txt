Little Man Tate were a four-piece indie band from Sheffield, England who formed in 2005 and split in 2009.

Like many other up and coming bands such as The Law, The View and The Lions, they made extensive use of MySpace as well as their own forum to communicate with and co-ordinate fans.

The band quickly began attracting interest from several record labels and in March 2006 signed to V2 Records, later parting ways in November 2007. 

The follow up album to About What You Know, Nothing Worth Having Comes Easy, was released on September 15th 2008.

Their first single, The Agent, was released on 7" with Just Can't Take It as the B-side. All 1,800 copies sold out as pre-orders.

Their fifth single, Sexy In Latin was released on January 22 and became their highest charting single yet, entering the official UK singles chart at number 20.

Since the band split up in 2009, Jon Windle (former lead singer and song-smith) has gone on to record his debut solo album Step Out The Man which was released through Tiny Teeth Records on 18th October 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Little+Man+Tate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
