There are a couple bands using the same name:

1) Chicago dark punk, early Christian Death worship. Formed in a basement on the southside of Chicago in October 2010. Released a demo in summer of 2011, and an album "Wind and Shadows" in 2015

2) Cemetery was an old school death metal band from Germany, who only recorded a single demo and an album entitled "Enter the Gate". Unfortunately, due to the bankruptcy of the record company, the album has never seen the light of day.

(or has it?)

They proceeded to change their name to Aeons End after Gaby Weihmayer joined the band, played Heavy/Speed metal, released a demo and an album, then split up a few years later.
