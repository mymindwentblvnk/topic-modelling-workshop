ELECTROCUTION 250 is an instrumental shred metal trio dedicated to progressing beyond the conventional realms of songwriting, by incorporating some of the most conventional things you'd never expect to hear - namely, cartoon music! This trio consists of Peter Wildoer (TIME REQUIEM, DARKANE, SILVER SERAPH), Todd Duane, and Lale Larson.

While not covering actual cartoon themes, the music composed on their debut album, "Electric Cartoon Music From Hell", proves the album to be aptly titled. Outrageously goofy stuff that sounds like it belongs in a Looney Tunes episode, all pulled off with staggering technicality and time changes, and at blinding speeds. This feat of musicianship, while still remaining entertaining, must be heard to be believed! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Electrocution+250">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
