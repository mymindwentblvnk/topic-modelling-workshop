Britsh/Irish singer song-writer Empara Mi was singing from a young age but only hit our music radars back in 2016. The Guernsey born and raised artist moved to London aged just 15 to pursue music and released her first single 'Wanderlust' as part of a trilogy of concept pieces alongside 'Spoon' and 'World We Live In'. Her late release of 'Shine On You' would go on to be used for ITV crime drama 'BroadChurch'. This was followed by 'Alibi' which was picked up by Netflix Original 'Dynasty'.

Taking inspiration from the likes of Portishead, Gorillaz, Dr Dre, Sade, Empara Mi started writing and recording for other people after graduating University with a History degree, basing herself in a bedroom studio and releasing from her own label.

The DIY queen has worked with Andrew Dawson (Kanye West), James Faunteroy (Drake, Rihanna) and contiues to work with long term writing partner Owen Cutts with a visual album set for release late 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Empara+Mi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
