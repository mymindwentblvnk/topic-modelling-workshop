Formerly know as Sword. Incredibly unique and massively punishing southern-tinged sludge that is equal parts Cavity and Sofa King Killer swing, gargantuan riffs that just tower above the listener in an Isis kind of fashion. They switch back and forth between different moods and sounds effortlessly. Though the slaughtering guitar work is the main focus here, everyone gets their chance to show off their skills. There's some excellent bass work and drumming on display here. It's all topped off with some killer hoarse screams. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lord+By+Fire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
