Everything started with the fact that, after finishing the music school at age 12, Ivan Volodin, with two of his classmates (who are not parties to the "Hammer of Witches") decided to create a group and went to a jazz teacher Alexander Andreyevich Federa. That's how jazz band come to live, in which Ivan was playing the drums. It lasted two years, and at this time Oleg, Ivan's brother, became involved in musical activities.

In result out of one jazz band came two groups, not jazz: Defective Toys, playing alternative, and "Molot Vedim". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Molot+Vedim">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
