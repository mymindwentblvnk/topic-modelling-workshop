1) Bondage was a promising new band from Italy. Their debut album Anima Terra consists of one long 50-minute suite divided into seven interconnected segments. The album is quite diverse and rather hard to describe, but the band is certainly rooted in the Italian tradition of lyrical and sophisticated progressive rock. I do hear elements of Camel, Deus Ex Machina, PFM, occasionally Banco and sporadically Zappa in their music. The vocalist has an expressive and distinctive voice which sometimes gives them a more theatrical touch. The guitarist had a personal touch: little bit of hard psych and a little bit of medieval! At times their music still seems somewhat underdeveloped. Nevertheless, Bondage was an interesting band with a good debut album. The band dissolved officially and some members have continued in different kinds of music.

2) Bondage is a punk rock band from Austin, Texas.
