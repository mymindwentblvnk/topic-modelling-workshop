Luci Tristis is a raw Black Metal band originating from the South of France.
Their first demo 'Simplex Mortalis' was released in 2006 via Eisiger Mond Productions and includes seven tracks:

1. Intro - As the Demon weeps
2. Alone in this painful Winter
3. A long trail to deviance
4. She bleeds onto the earth
5. Lygurian myth
6. The tragedy of the cathares
7. Outro - Transalpine Gaule

The two members Anthem and Zorg Kaedes met in High school, and are currently preparing 3 tracks to be released on a split.
Anthem's lyrics reflect his feelings as a commun day mortal, and also explicit his interest for ancient pagan civilisations.
The new Luci Tristis tracks are said to be in a much more pagan-metal vein, being faster, more atmopsheric and integrating synth generated sounds and gregorian chant. 

Luci Tristis is officialy part of the 'True Southern Black Art', which regroups raw Black Metal bans from all over the Southern regions of France.
