BIO
The band formed in 1995 as a thrash/punk trio named Davidian. In December of 1996 the band recorded the demo ''Friday the 13th''at Voices Studio. After some line up changes the promo ''Never an Angel'' was recorded at Voices Studio in June of 1998 with some heavy/power metal influences and the addition of keyboards. The next demo ''Closer to god'' was recorded at the same studio in September of 1999 featuring some progressive rock elements. 
Line up changes, a change of name (from Davidian to Stillborn Virtue) and different musical influences again lead the band to a more heavy/thrash approach and the recording of the demo ''R.I.P.'' in Baseline studio in March of 2002. After fulfilling military obligations of their members Stillborn Virtue performed several gigs in local clubs like An club, Kyttaro, Rodeo, After Dark, Underworld, “ston aera”, Artichoke bar, and others. The band in 2008 went into Encore studio to record its debut album "Foreseen" .The mixing and mastering of the album was done in Basement studio. The sound of the album features metal and rock elements. The band is currently looking for a label
