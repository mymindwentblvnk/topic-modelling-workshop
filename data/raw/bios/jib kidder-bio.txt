Jib Kidder is one of the monikers multimedia collagist Sean Schuster-Craig uses for his art, whether he's making chalk graffiti murals or musical mosaics. Schuster-Craig grew up in Georgia and was inspired by the Southern hip-hop scene -- which he later paid homage to with his online anthology Twankle and Glisten -- and, via a stint in Ann Arbor, Michigan, ended up in San Francisco. He self-released many albums, as well as mixtapes under the Kid Slizzard name, but didn't issue his official debut album until 2008. All on Y'all was released by States Rights and was accompanied by All on Y'all: Da Mixtape! One of the album's songs, "Windowdipper," turned the alert sounds from the Windows operating system into a booty bass anthem; Schuster-Craig's cut-and-paste video for the track became something of a viral sensation, and the song also appeared on the Fox network's dance competition show So You Think You Can Dance? With the money he earned from licensing the song to the show, Schuster-Craig moved to Los Angeles for a year and worked on three albums, including Lossy Angeles, Beloved Forever Calling, and Music for Hypnotized Minds, the latter of which was released by Asthmatic Kitty in 2011.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jib+Kidder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
