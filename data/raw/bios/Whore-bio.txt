4) Whore is an industrial metal/coldwave band from Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. Bio:

"Whore is the creation of a certain Jim Wicked and Dez Wicked both of whom previously did work for musical projects such as The Divine Chemical (voted number one industrial band in Nevada by musicmates.com) as well as stints with Sleep Now Yes and Another Liquid Ramble. After many years of introspection, misdirection, and self-destruction, Mr. and Mrs. Wicked have returned with a new project of music that attempts to tackle head-on the demons which haunt the very nature of existence in a combative environment of layered industrial rhythms, heavily distorted guitars, synthetic soundscapes, and pleas to a God which has long ago turned it's back on the human species.

Whore is in the process of finishing their self-titled album which will be released by DSBP Records. Besides Mr. and Mrs. Wicked's talents, this album also features the mixing skills of Ben and Bonnie Pebley of Revolution State. Whore also has a series of live shows in the works that reach beyond the imaginations of its viewers and demonstrate the true fear-inducing vision of Whore."
