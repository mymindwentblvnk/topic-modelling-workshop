Heart of Darkness emerged in the summer of 2002 when artist Luke Haughwout completed his university degree and decided to take his electronic music enthusiasm to the next level.
Soon after, the ambient net-label Mannequin Oddio Media became interested in Heart of Darkness, and a partnership was formed.

Over the next year, he began writing and reworking tracks that would eventually become the album 'Survival'. The album features a blend of dark electro, EBM, and gothic dance music. The songs deal with themes of pain, personal loss, and overcoming fear.

'Survival' had a limited release in mid 2004, when Heart of Darkness, Mannequin Oddio Media, and Flaming Fish Music decided to do a three way split on the cost of a professional re-release.

Currently, Luke resides with his girlfriend in Allentown, PA. working full-time as a writer and producer of television commercials. Production on the second Heart of Darkness album is underway, as are numerous other musical collaborations and projects with other musicians.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heart+of+Darkness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
