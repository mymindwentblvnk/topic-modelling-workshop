- Fernando Colunga Ultimate Experience (or FCUE) is a Fun / Parody / Grindcore / Death Metal / Death'n'Roll project from the city of Požarevac (Serbia).

- The main idea for starting the band/project came from the guitarist Bagzy who wanted to play and record some Grindcore music. He asked his friends Žižak and ZycloN to help him with it.

- The band/project itself is imagined as a parody on the popular Latin soap-opera series in Serbia, which are highly rated on the TV. The name of the band came from the name of one of the most popular Latin actors, Fernando Colunga Olivares.

- FCUE's lyrics are also about some more "serious" themes, but criticism, parody and joke are present throughout the verses.

Band members:
- guitar: Stefanros Beinho Ronaldo (aka Bagzy)

- bass guitar (and drum programming): Marcos la Feisto Ricardo (aka Žižak)

- vocals: Antonio Batistuta De la Vega (aka ZycloN) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fernando+Colunga+Ultimate+Experience">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
