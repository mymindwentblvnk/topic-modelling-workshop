Coredust is a metal band from Helsinki, Finland. 

The current lineup took form in the early 2007, roughly at the time when the first 3 track demo was recorded. 

After the first demo was released, Coredust played a bunch of gigs in southern Finland. Encouraged by the good reception received from the live shows, some new songs were written. These new songs would eventually appear on the latest EP (Past Lives).
