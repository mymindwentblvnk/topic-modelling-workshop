Biography:

My name is Marvin Haak also known as DJ The Fallen One.

I'm 23 years old and come original from Delft and live now for a few years in Eindhoven.
At the moment I'm in training to be a experiential expert for teenager with problems in life. Beside this I'm mostly working on my DJ career and volunteer at Dynamo.

-since over a year, I play mainly early / mainstream 
hardcore, I've performed a few times successfully, with a positive feedback from the crowed. 

-My dream and ambition in life is become a professional at DJ at well known / recognized record company and booking agency. 

-When I Start my set, I focus on the music and crowed. I have an excellent feeling what my public likes an what made them to come in the mood for an ultimate dance night. This gives me so much energy am I really enjoy watching my public. 

What makes me different from other DJ's:

I live my moment with my own style in early / mainstream hardcore and then I see
the audience come loose and there is harmony between me and the plublic.
My strength is giving a power boost to the next performing DJ. I get the crowed in the right atmosphere.
