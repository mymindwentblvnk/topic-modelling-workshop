1) Aneurysm are an Italian metal band, formed in 1994 in Verona.
Although initially influenced by 1980s thrash metal bands such as Metallica, Pantera and Fear Factory, Aneurysm has elaborated their own sound, combining thrash with progressive metal and characteristic vocals. Seven years after the first demo-tape "Burst" (1995), their first full-length album "Aware" was released (2002), reviewed with enthusiastic words. In June 2005, Aneurysm began recording "Shades", a 15 tracks concept in which Hansi KÃ¼rsch from Blind Guardian appeared as special guest. In 2007 the album was released by Old Ones Records, received very positively by public and critics.
