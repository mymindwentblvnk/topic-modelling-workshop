To Separate The Flesh From The Bones is a death metal/grindcore band from Helsinki, Finland. The band can be considered a side-project of three remarkable members of Finland's Metal and rock scenes: Pasi Koskinen (ex-Amorphis, Shape of Despair, Ajattara), Mika Karppinen aka "Gas" (HIM) and Niclas Etel채vuori (Amorphis, ex-Moonspell).

The project began circa 2002 when three active members of Finland's metal scene decided to create a grindcore and brutal death metal playground in the form of a side-project. Pasi Koskinen and Niclas Etel채vuori, ex-bandmates from Amorphis, would join Mika Karppinen (known as "Gas" in the Gothic rock band HIM) to create some aggressive and gore landscapes that differed radically from their other musical projects.
Though the bandmembers' real names are known, they want to keep their identities hidden by covering their faces in promo pictures and live concerts and by using pseudonyms instead of their real names: Herr Arschstein (Pasi Koskinen), Rot Wailer (Niclas Etel채vuori) and Pus Sypope (Mika Karppinen).

They combine brutality, speed, short songs and gore imagery as main goals, the band released their first EP in 2004 called "For Those About to Rot" (A joke on AC/DC's "For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)"). Influences by other bands like Carcass (The forefathers of the genre) and classical death metal can be clearly noticed.
Following, on November 24th 2004, Spinefarm Records released the band's first album "Utopia Sadistica". The musical aesthetics are the same and Carcass' Jeff Walker makes a guest appearance on the album.
