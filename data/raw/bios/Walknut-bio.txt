Walknut is an atmospheric black metal band from Moscow, Russia that formed in 2006, including members of Temnozor, Forest and Nitberg.  They released their debut full-length, "Graveforests and Their Shadows" through Stellar Winter Records on April 24, 2007.  They claim their musical style is influenced by northern nature and mysticism.  The name "Walknut" was derived from Valknutr, the modern name for an old Norse symbol that consists of three interlocked triangles and appears on Scandinavian rune stones in connection with Odin.  Their song "Motherland Ostenvegr" is a free download on Stellar Winter's website. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Walknut">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
