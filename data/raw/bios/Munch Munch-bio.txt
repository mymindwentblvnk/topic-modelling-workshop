MUNCH MUNCH are a kaleidoscopic pop group from Bristol who write ecstatic, elliptical songs that burst with creativity and restless energy. The band are four friends: Tom, Richard, Jack and Sarah Louise. Their songs swim deep only to breach the waves in spectacular style. Concerned with shivering eternity, rusting history and touching upon the many vistas and dead-ends of love, Munch Munch are constantly trying to catch up with the uncertain moments which most validate our lives.

The band have toured the UK and Europe, playing with the likes of Dirty Projectors, Why?, No Age, Ponytail, Clues and Hot Chip. Along the way they have recorded a BBC Radio 1 Maida Vale session for Huw Stevens, and played festivals including Lovebox, Truck, Tanned Tin in Spain, and Imago in Portugal.
