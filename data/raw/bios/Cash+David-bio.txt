Cash+David create beats that echo the repetition of the sedated suburban terraced houses that surround their solitary shed studio. This co- operative garage band fractures their history and pieces together a modern day antidote to the manufactured, pre-packaged status quo.

Starting out as a singular moody electric guitar stem ‘Pulse’, a five minute bass/house loop was worked into a propelling three minute synth pop track with Eastern influences and pulsing guitars and synths. The western pop duo brought together a cluster fuck of genres from world to glitch to pop to create this vibrant indie disco anthem. ‘Pulse’ is released on 9th June 2014.

This enigmatic band releases material exclusively online on their own label +, their first single ‘Funn’ released in March this year was accompanied by a video expressing Cash+David as two epicene dancers dressed up as Johnny Cash and David Bowie.

The trans-genre rebellious duo, compliment each other with their different approaches to making beat laden experimental pop music. Cash is grammatical, adding sparkle and clarity to synths, locking rhythms and eloquently programming David’s scruffy, distorted, trashy guitars and Eastern world music patterns. The polarising duo aligned on discovering a mutual love of Bacon, Dylan Thomas and B movies, a partnership concreted by their shared birthday. From David’s logic sketches and Cash’s pro-tools dexterity came a flourish of indie guitar, house beat, world rhythm, tribal rock and trashy pop tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cash%252BDavid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
