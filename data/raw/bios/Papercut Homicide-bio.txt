Papercut Homicide started as an experimental musical endeavor, an offspring from the members of RedSky and Fire at Zero Gravity.  Papercut Homicide was formed in Edinboro, PA.  The brain child of Jack Collopy(original member of Redsky) with lead singer Jon Burdick(Fire at Zero Gravity); the band played in limited venues with the release of their album "From Filth Comes Grace".   A critical success; however, due to member obligations and several band tour conflicts, Papercut Homicide never completely raised scene awareness or commercial success.  Disbanded in the late 90's, each member went on to pursue other musical interests.  All members of Papercut Homicide played an integral role in the parody rap act MPFW; in addition, Jon Burdick went on to Like Braile to the Blind, Jack Collopy & Phil Hogan went on to form NEMO.    Also.  Matt Pinfield loved them.
