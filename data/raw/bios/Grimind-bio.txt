Grimind is a metal band from the french part of Switzerland.

The story begins in 1997 when David, Lucien and Matthieu gather to “rock” with the influences from bands such as Paradise Lost, Seigmen, Metallica or The Gathering.

They record a first demo at the Ohm studio in Colombier (1998) that allows the band to play many concerts all around. With the experience, they decide to create a new sound with samples which give atmospheric and gothic style to the music.

The first single “Absolute loneliness” is recorded in 2002 with a new bass-player, Frederic Hanhard. The gigs go on specially as the Balelec Festival or the AOC Rock festival in Savièse.

In 2003, the band records a six-track EP "Escaped from life" at the AUM studio in Bavois with Patrick Matthey. With the help of the label Adipocere Records in France, the EP is distributed and commented all around from Europe to the United States by webzines and radios. Grimind plays lots of concerts in Switzerland and is also invited during the broadcast “Garage” on TV TSR2 in October 2004. Lucien leaves the band and Arnaud Nicod takes his place.

At this moment, the band takes another direction with a deeper and more powerful sound. A three-track demo came out in 2007 which brang all the new concepts : melodic and stronger vocals, heavier riffs, “attacking” drums and fabulous gothic and spatial atmosphere … that’s the new Grimind style.

Quentin Nussbaumer arrives in the band in 2008 as a fixed bass-player and the guys work hard to record a new album for middle of 2009.
