Anaxim is an electronic project of Phillip Byrne 
Originally beginning as a funk sampling dance project with the album 5:09 AM, Anaxim has taken a more violent electro route with the new album "Into Nature (2009)"

"A hidden little DIY gem, Phillip Byrne (codename: Anaxim) whips up a satisfying punch in the head of bedroom house music destined to make your neck sway back and forth to keep up with your jolting foot. Consistency is what drives the album over its near hour duration spanning epics with unabashed piano and string tangents towards flights of repetition that portray the greater appreciations for the concept. In all, Into Nature is a delightfully surprisingly solid chuck of bump that is a great album to sit back and watch on the new iTunes visualizer"
