MP5K is a brutal death metal band from Stockholm, formed in the summer of 2006. The founding members were Andreas Tseung (vocals) and Fredrik Widigs (drums) who both wanted to create a brutal death metal band with crushing breakdowns and guttural vocals. They both were very influenced by the brutal and groove-oriented Stockholm death metal act Soils of Fate had created a few years earlier. They came in touch with Henke Crantz (vocalist of Soils of Fate) who became a big source of inspiration and motivation for the band. He even came up with the band name "MP5K". However, to find the right members for this purpose was not so easy in Stockholm. For a while, Magnus Magnusson (now playing with Insision) was going to be lead guitarist but we parted ways due to different views on how we wanted the outcome to be. Later on, Fredrik Segell (now playing with Canopy) hooked up with MP5K and played guitar for a few months. The band then got a more technical and complex approach which was too far away from the vision of simple, straight-forward and brutal death metal which Andreas and Fredrik originally had in mind. In november 2006 they met Erik "Wolfen" Carmstad at a concert and started to conversate about the need of a really brutal death metal, the only one of its kind in Stockholm. Wolfen appeared to be the perfect guitarist for MP5K, writing highly original riffs, both fast and insane, as well as down-tempo ultra-brutal breakdown riffs. Their debut demo "Deranged Stockholm Syndrome" is going to be recorded in July 2007 so be ready for the brutality when it hits you like a kick in the face! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MP5K">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
