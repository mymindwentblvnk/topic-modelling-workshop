The Black Neon recorded 'Arts & Crafts' at the Audio Sonic Studiotechnik in Berlin, Germany. The Black Neon was assisted in various performance elements and sound manipulation by Falk U. Rogner (Amon Düül), Harald Grosskopf (Ash Ra Tempel) and Yasuhiro Otani. 

Though speaking not more then 17 words of the language, The Black Neon's affinity and spiritual bond with Deutschland could not be stronger. On 'Arts & Crafts', semi autobiographical tales of love and de-conscription from the DDR army ('Ralph & Barbara') and Man-Machine love affairs (TX81Z) blend seamlessly into The Black Neon's sprawling instrumentals played in the traditional Motorik style. 

Themes of love, loss and potent imagery of mastication, escaping to Mexico and silver sharks are all present. The Black Neon may or may not explore these themes further on future releases. 

The Black Neon played his last show at the Motaryno Arts Fesitval in Poland at the end of 2001. He no longer plays live.
