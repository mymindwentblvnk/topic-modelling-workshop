Rocco can’t be contained. The 19-year-old rapper and producer makes music that swerves between lanes, crafting tracks inspired by emotive rap, hazy R&B, boundary-pushing pop, and more. Over the years, the Pennsylvania artist has showcased his thoughtful approach in tracks like “Honest” and “Lie To Me,” which feature confident bars about being in his bag but also allow room for darker thoughts and bruised feelings. His releases so far—2018’s Who Would’ve Thought, 2020’s The Warmup, and several singles in 2021—are testaments to the mature songwriting that has made Rocco an ascendant star. Growing up in Coatesville, PA, Rocco was a rambunctious kid who learned how to use that energy as creative fuel. As early tracks like “Falling in Love” and “Only You” started racking up streams on SoundCloud, he saw the fruits of his labor when Chicago drill legend Lil Bibby reached out on Instagram. That led to Chicago Rap pioneer and a-list music executive Bibby and Grade A Productions (home to acts like Juice Wrld and The Kid Laroi) partnering with multimedia mogul Kenya Barris (Blackish, Grownish) to sign Rocco to Grade A/Khalabo /Interscope Records. Now, Rocco doesn’t plan on relaxing until his name joins the lineage of other storied acts from his home state. If he continues making songs as boldly adventurous and intimately relatable as he has been, that goal almost seems modest. Rocco is ready for the world’s stage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rocco">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
