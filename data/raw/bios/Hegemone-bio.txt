Evoked around 2010 as a sub-project of old-school thrashing madness. Some musicians came through this project but only around beginning of 2012 did the current line-up become stable. Since then Kacper, Tomasz, Jakub and Marcin began their road made of fury, heaviness, melancholy and psychedelic sounds. There is no path or goal defined. Only thing is moment of madness’ mastery. No more to be said…

Hegemone (moon - originally called S/2003 J8): Considered a member of the Pasiphae group, a family of Jovian satellites which have similar orbits and are therefore thought to have a common origin. Discovered on 8 February 2003 by Scott S. Sheppard, David C. Jewitt, Jan T. Kleyna, Yanga R. Fernandez, and Henry H. Hsieh at the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii.

Hegemone (Grace): Daughter of Zeus, the Greek equivalent of the Roman god Jupiter. The name means "female leader."
