Femi Kuti is an award winning Nigerian musician, and the oldest son of legendary Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti.

Femi was born in London on 16 June 1962 and grew up in the former Nigerian capital Lagos.

Like his father, Femi has shown a strong commitment to social and political causes throughout his career, but he differs in his religious views.

In 2001, Femi collaborated with a number of US musicians such as Common, Mos Def, and Jaguar Wright, on his Fight to Win album. This album was widely regarded as the most influential Neo-Afrobeat album of the early 21st century.
