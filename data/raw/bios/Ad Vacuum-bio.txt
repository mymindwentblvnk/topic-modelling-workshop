Ad Vacuum is a one man project. It started in 2003 when guillaume discovered the possibilities that new technologies offered. He tries to create a unique sound by mixing electronic elements and real instruments (guitars, bass, saxophone and voice). Ad Vacuum is the individualism as a philosophy. The composer is self-centered and narcissic, just like we’re all! Every listener can feel that the music only reveals what is in his mind. The writer writes for himself, the reader reads for himself too. So by trying to touch himself as he composes the songs, the artist tends to be universal. So listen to the music : it’s yours! Until now, Ad Vacuum made 3 recordings : 2004 "Vertigo" : depressive, this recording is the most electronic. Very dark. 2005 "Sweet & Sour" : depressive too, this release is more extreme. Folk guitars struggle against heavy distortions. 2006 "Intimacy" : depressive again, it’s the sweetest recording. It offers smooth rythms, beautiful acoustic guitars and some powerful parts. The project has found its way. Hope you will like it. Every comments are welcome. Guillaume is also part of : TEMPUS FUGIT : http://www.fugit-tempus.tk/ H.O.P.E.
