Lightning Seeds are an alternative/pop band, largely the brainchild of writer, singer and guitarist Ian Broudie (born 4th August 1958 in Liverpool, England). The band currently consists of Ian Broudie (vocals, guitar), Riley Broudie (guitar), Martyn Campbell (bass), Angie Pollock (keyboard) and Jack Prince (drums). Co-founder Simon Rogers, although no longer a member of the band, still works with them during album recordings. They are best known for three songs: 1989's "Pure", 1992's "The Life of Riley" and 1996's "Three Lions"

Broudie and Rogers formed the act as the "perfect pop project", and Lightning Seeds broke through in 1989 with the psychedelic synth pop hit, "Pure", which made the UK Top 20 and was a minor hit on US pop radio and a major success on US alternative radio. In the 1990s Lightning Seeds became one of the most popular and enterprising of the era. The 1995 album Jollification was a critical masterpiece, spawning several successful singles. In 1996, Lightning Seeds provided the music and production for the official England anthem for the Euro '96 football tournament. The lyrics were written and sung by comedians Frank Skinner and David Baddiel, and the song, "Three Lions", went straight into the charts at number one.

Since the release of 1999's Tilt the act has taken a back seat as Broudie concentrated on producing the works of others. However, in 2006, Broudie reformed the band with a selection of new members, releasing a Very Best Of album, and performing a number of tour dates. In 2009, the band released Four Winds, their first album in 10 years. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Lightning+Seeds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
