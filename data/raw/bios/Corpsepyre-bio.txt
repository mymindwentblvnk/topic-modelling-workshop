The story of Corpsepyre began in 2002 when two bands, Kain and Sickore, emerged to revive the Lahore underground. Sickore later disbanded and from its ashes Corpsepyre was formed. The band soon garnered a reputation for the no holds barred approach of their shows and in January 2003, they were a part of the biggest heavy metal concert ever to take place in Pakistan, along with Northern Alliance, Kain, Incision, Entity and other bands. 

After recording two demos, the band was in the process of joining Entrail Records from the US. They recruited Waqas Ahmed from Kain and Saquib Malik moved to drums and signalled the start of a new, and better death metal sound. They began composing their debut album, and had a professional artist from Mexico making their album cover. However, thanks to Saquib Malik's new found drug addiction (and various other problems) the band split-up. 

Saquib Malik has went on to form Black Albatross and start Esto Perpetua records in the US. Waqas Ahmed has found fame in the rebuilt underground with Kain (who began playing post-grunge tinged progressive rock) and Orion (Pak)/Odyssey (Pak). Hassan Mir now plays in the melodic death metal/metalcore band Dementia (Pak). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/corpsepyre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
