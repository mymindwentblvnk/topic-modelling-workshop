Ketea formed in May 2006 after the break-up of a band Emily and Lonnie were in called IO. Trey and Lonnie were good friends and former band mates in a project called Mouthbreather which split a couple of years before. Trey found out they needed a drummer. And after just one jam they knew they had something different and exciting. They are a 3 piece with Lonnie on bass and vocals, Trey on drums, and Emily on guitar and vocals.
