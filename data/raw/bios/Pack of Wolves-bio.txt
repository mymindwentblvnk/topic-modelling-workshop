1.) Pack of Wolves (Austria) 
The story of this very pack begins in 2006 when Thomas Benke (dr), Stefan Benke (g) and Erich Kuttnig (b) came together to form a band. They started to write songs which were very dynamic, complex and melodic at the same time – but all these songs were instrumentals only because none of the founding members wanted to sing. So they kept working on their songs while looking for a singer, which they finally found in summer 2007, when Thomas Talger (voc) joined them. Now the pack was complete and ready to hunt for your aching hearts. They rehearsed, played some shows in Styria and Carinthia (supporting great bands like Trip Fontaine, Rodriguez and Red Lights Flash), wrote a couple of new songs and recorded five of them in December 07/January 08. These songs should’ve been released in May 2008. But 2008 was a year full of disasters (sports accidents, surgeries, unusable rehearsal rooms, damaged band busses and deaths of family members), nothing worked out as it should have - so it took them over a year to release their first EP “Intimacy is a serious danger”. Now they’re ready to start off. So be aware: the wolves are coming, the wolves are right here! 

"Pack of Wolves delivers an onslaught of raw, bloody, and biting emotion in every line of every song. The often abstract pain of grief, anger, disappointment, and conflicted love all find palpable form and expression in the lyrics and vocal delivery of Intimacy Is A Serious Danger. Instrumental pacing calls to mind early punk acts like The Sex Pistols and the original line-up of The Ramones." (Tastes Like Rock! Music Magazine, USA 2009)

2.) Pack of Wolves (Texas) 
Prowling out from the luminous haze of Austin’s Red River District, the southern metal band Pack of Wolves is ready for the chase. This brotherhood was forged in 2006 when Trey Ramirez, formerly of At All Cost, teamed up with Adrian Carillio and Tyson Swindell, from Games and Theory, and Beardsley McSwain. This alliance grew quickly and in early 2007, Pack of Wolves began running with their self released LP, The Wall Crusher. Surviving on successful touring, album and merchandise sales, and a rabid following of supporters the Wolf Pack has earned critics respect regionally as well as throughout the Central and Eastern US.

Influenced by little more than a thirst for blood and to bark at the moon, the Pack of Wolves creates a uniquely demanding and momentous sound composed of elements of traditional epic hard rock that have been flavored with the more brutal and bitter taste of Venom. And, just as in nature, if the wolf pack’s prey is caught in the open, then they will thin the heard of those too weak to survive the attack. However, those who are fit to run with the wolves will become stronger for doing so. 

Keeping on their aggressive pace, the Pack of Wolves began recording their second full-length album in April 2008 at the Diamond Factory in Austin, Texas. Plans are set for the albums release to coincide with a string of tour dates throughout the UK. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pack+of+Wolves">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
