About; Influencers
Biography; "Rizz & Matt brought clipped guitar riffs set to cinematic melodies and cut with crisp and supremely lyrical vocals. Their performance had a mature streak that is the hallmark of well-versed musicians. On stage VOWWS are demure and restrained, and their music is emotionally potent, a self-possessed and – dare I say – cherished insanity reminiscent of the late Cornell’s Black Hole Sun."
