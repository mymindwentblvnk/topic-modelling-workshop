From the ashes of Finding Core, Panic Therapy and From Ember To Inferno comes Rise II Ruin, Southwestern Ontario’s latest contribution to the modern hard rock/melodic metal genre. Hailing from the Chatham-Kent area, Rise II Ruin fuses elements of modern hard rock, melodic metal and classic grunge to produce a unique, yet not unfamiliar, sound. Influenced by the likes of Nonpoint, Sevendust, Alice In Chains, Deftones and Kings X, Rise II Ruin is poised to make their own mark. 
Formed in early 2015, Rise II Ruin is currently in the process of writing and recording their debut EP in anticipation of live performances, and an official studio release in 2016. The core of the band consists of Kenny Deuxberry (vocals), Mark Jeffs (drums) and Zach Stenton (guitar) with the recent addition of Ryan Countryman (bass). 
In late 2014, knowing Kenny had been relatively inactive since the breakup of Finding Core, Mark and Zach approached him about starting an all new original outfit…their first outing since dissolving Panic Therapy in early 2011. Rehearsals fired up in March of 2015 and the chemistry was apparent immediately. After months of writing, rehearsing and auditioning, Rise II Ruin welcomed ex-From Ember To Inferno bassist Ryan Countryman into the fold. Lead-off single (and literally the first song written together as a band) 'Down Again' displays the bands dynamic range and maturity as both musicians and songwriters. Future follow-ups include 'Reflections', 'Afraid No More' and the mid-tempo 'Lost'. 
Be sure to catch Rise II Ruin live and look out for their inaugural studio EP release in 2016.
