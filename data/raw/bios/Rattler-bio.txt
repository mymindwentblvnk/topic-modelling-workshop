Rattler is an American rock n' roll band from Washington, DC.   Banned from literally every live music venue in the District (save for the Rock N Roll Hotel), the group has still managed to dominate the Washington, DC music scene via their sold-out shows, unprecedented stage antics, and the highest-grossing per show bar tabs three years running.  The bandâ€™s unrelenting commitment toward creating the greatest party/show ever has completely won over both the BMX and skateboarding communities, with promoters often flying the band around the country for special one-off engagements and premieres.

Rattler is a part of the Magic Bullet Records and have two releases to date: 2007's split CD with Nitro Tokyo and "Incoming," their full length debut (2009).

Rattler CD's can be purchased in the Magic Bullet Records webstore.
