Annelie is a Dutch musician and songwriter based in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

At first, Annelie lent her vocal talents, instrumental proficiency and musical versatility to other artists, but on her 2018 début album, After Midnight, she deliberately explores and gravitates within the limitations of a single instrument: the piano. 

In her childhood the piano, in addition to the saxophone, was the only instrument that consistently drew her attention. It all started a couple of years ago when her parents gave her a piano as a gift. She fell in love with the sound and began to write so many compositions in a short period of time that she decided to make an album. 

All of the music on her début LP was recorded at home: you only hear the individual, the instrument and the environment in which the music came to be. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Annelie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
