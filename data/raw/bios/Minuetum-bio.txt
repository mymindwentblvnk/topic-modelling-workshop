Minuetum is the power metal band formed in 2007 when Dimitris Melidis (keyboards) presented his songs to his university-mate Dimitris Zacharopoulos (vocals) in Athens/Greece. Zacharopoulos soon came up with lyrics on the songs written by Melidis and the two of them soon approached some talented new musicians to record some demos. Two demos were recorded including the first typical characteristics of the band. Songs "Ghost King", "Into the Night", "Key to Glory", "Finally Free" and "Hero Divine" included in these demos recorded with different line ups during 2007 and 2008. Then the duet decided to go on with new musicians. Argentinian bassist Nacho Lopez (Lord Kraven) and Bob Katsionis (Firewind, Outloud) who work with them as a guest guitarist and as a producer. After testing many guitarists and drummers in March of 2009 they recruited Jason Mercury (Katsionis' bandmate from Outloud) and Drummer Nick Parotidis.
In summer of 2009, once again under the supervision of Bob Katsionis (production) and with his help as a guest musician on guitars and producer recorded the final Version of their first album. Apart from Katsionis' participation on the guitar-role, on the songs of "Haunted Spirit" you can also hear the female voice of Iro Kalligeri. The album was mixed and mastered by Timo Tolkki (ex-Stratovarius, Revolution Renaissance). "Haunted Spirit" was released in July the 2nd 2010 by 7Hard Records (www.7hard.de).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Minuetum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
