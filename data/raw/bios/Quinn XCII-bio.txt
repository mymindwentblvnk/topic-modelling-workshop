Growing up in Detroit, Quinn XCII was raised on the cityâ€™s Motown musical history, fueling a passion for myriad musical genres from rock to reggae to funk to hip-hop. Three years ago, as a sophomore at Michigan State, Quinn XCII began to write and record his own music, quickly becoming a college mixtape sensation. Traveling frequently to Ann Arbor to record new material with his childhood friend producer ayokay, Quinn XCII began to craft his own laid-back sound that drew on hip-hop, electronic, and tropical influences.

His debut EP Change of Scenery was released in May 2015, garnering wide acclaim and millions of online streams. His next single release "Stung" quickly went to #1 on HypeMachine's Popular Charts.
