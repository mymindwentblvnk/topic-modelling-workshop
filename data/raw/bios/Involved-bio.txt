Involved is an international collaboration between Joe Dorsey (Until Sunrise, Ocean Architecture) and Reivilo Enoignor (Battlestations). The collaboration arose after Joe discovered and fell in love with Battlestations’ 2012 album In A Cold Embrace. Joe contacted the band and sent them some of his previous work, Reivilo replied, and the Involved project was born.

Involved’s influences vary widely, including Tangerine Dream, Pet Shop Boys, Massive Attack, Cult of Luna, Anathema and Ulver. Their debut album Revolving Maze was constructed in fragments, with Joe and Reivilo sharing ideas and sounds entirely over the internet. Reivilo (keyboards, electronics, production) would send the basis for a track, and Joe (vocals, keyboards, production) would flesh out the melodies and add instrumental colour. They independently released the Implant EP in September 2013, and completed Revolving Maze in November 2013.

Revolving Maze is released through Hidden Shoal on 19 September 2014.
