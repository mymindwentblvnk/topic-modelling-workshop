The four original members of Scarlet Red initially played together in a secular band called Lust prior to accepting Christ into their lives.  When the bands drummer got saved, he no long could justify being in a band with such a name and purpose, and, as a result, he left Lust which prompted the entire group to break up.  Nevertheless, in time and without any communication with one another, each former member of Lust became a Christian.  After getting back in touch, they wanted to create music reflecting their new found faith and subsequently formed Scarlet Red, a band whose name was chosen to honor the blood of Christ.  Scarlet Red proceeded to place the track "You Live Fast" on The Axemen compilation in 1988 before releasing its debut Don't Dance With Danger on Pure Metal Records the following year.

On Don't Dance With Danger Scarlet Red plays a combination of commercial flavored pop metal and melodic hard rock certain to appeal to fans of Shout, Stryper, Guardian, Angelica and Poison.  While lead vocalist Danis might not quite have the range of Nancy Jo Mann (Barnabas) or Lisa Faxson (Ransom), she puts in an all around solid and commendable performance.  The lead guitar work of Curtis Lee can comes across in a manner that is inconsistent and restrained.  When allowed to cut loose on tracks such as "You Live Fast" and "Break The Chains", however, he proves a very fine musician.
