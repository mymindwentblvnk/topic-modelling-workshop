Formed during the later part of the year 2009, Perdition Now offers technical metal of death with thrash metal influences mixed up with eerie and bizarre melodies using also digital effects and MIDI-instruments in its music. Founder of the band is K.Tormentor, and currently the only member playing, programming and composing everything by his own hands. Birthplace of the band is Jyväskylä, little city in the middle part of Finland. Barely no one knows who is the real man behind the act since founder does not want to be a public surface of his music. 

Music has got its influences from several bands. For example, early products of SENTENCED, emperor and katatonia are strong influences and some same melancholy can be found from Perdition Now´s music. Of course there´s even more acts that have left their handmarks to PN´s music. Non-musical influences are, for example, ghosts, poetry, chaos theories, opportunism of people and even some movies.

Usual lyrical themes handle people´s own misery, strong emotions, death and Weakness of mankind in front of changing circumstances. Lyrics never include any satanic point of view, relations between god and satan or other religious themes. Perdition Now released its first promotional CD in the end of july 2010.
