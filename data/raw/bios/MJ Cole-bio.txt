MJ Cole (born Matthew James Firth Coleman, 1973) is a house and UK garage producer and remixer. Born in London, England, his student days were spent studying classical music at LCU and the Royal College of Music, while his student nights were devoted to raving to hardcore and jungle at Telepathy and Raindance. 

After starting his own label Prolific Recordings, Cole produced a song called "Sincere" in 1998 with a sampler and an Amiga. One of the twenty test pressings of "Sincere" was received by Pete Tong, who started playing the tune on his national BBC radio 1 show. Cole then signed on Gilles Peterson's Talkin' Loud label, where he recorded "Sincere", the album. The Mercury Music Prize nominated (2000) debut won him the accolade of Best Producer from the prestigious Muzik and Mobo magazine awards, sold over 60,000 copies in the UK alone and spawned two outstanding Top 15 singles.

He released a second long player "Cut to the chase" (2003) and he has collaborated on and remixed works by Jill Scott, Tom Jones and Mariah Carey.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MJ+Cole">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
