KILPATIENT M.D. is the mind of musician John Bradley. Born in Germany, he now resides in Texas where he created this project to satisfy his need to play heavy. At the time, John played lead guitar in the smooth jazz funk band Soul Inc. even though Black Sabbath's Iron Man was what inspired him to pick the guitar in the first place. KILPATIENT M.D. became official with the debut release of  Bodies in 2005 followed by Character Witness in 2007 and Psycho - Ology in 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kilpatient+M.D.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
