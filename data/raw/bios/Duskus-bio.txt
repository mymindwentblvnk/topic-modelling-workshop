Pushing forward with his own genre of 'romantic rave' music, Duskus makes Notion an exclusive mix full of euphoric dance tracks in honour of his latest single "Let Go". Duskus is a London-based producer on a mission to put the romance back into dance music. His latest single “Let Go” came late last month, the second single from the artist’s highly anticipated EP ‘Healers Vol.1’ due this month.

First breaking into producing in 2015, Duskus has gone from strength to strength during his often collaborative musical journey. Joining with DJ Mag for his first live show live show, many of his solo releases, as well as link-ups with the likes of Taska Black and San Holo, have hit multi-million streams on Spotify. Recently performing on the Do LaB Stage at Coachella, this year has already been a big one.

His latest single “Let Go” marks a musical shift Duskus, channeling a love of 2000s UK rave music into the production. Speaking on the inspiration for the track, Duskus explains: “This beat is a little different, I wanted to make some simple again that wasn’t super ‘poppy’. As I was on tour I didn’t have access to any of my equipment so I wanted to see if I could make something just on my laptop like the old days – this is the result of me messing around.” The release works alongside the launch of Duskus’ monthly event series ‘Romantic Rave’ named in-honour by how he describes the sound of the upcoming EP. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Duskus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
