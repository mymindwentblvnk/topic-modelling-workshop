Discovered in 2017 through the track Plan$ recorded alongside rappers Flawless & Joe Rocca, Tyleen quickly attracts attention within the Montreal rap scene. Originally from the LaSalle neighbourhood, the young rapper has been carving out her place in the local English rap community, where women are still under-represented.

Tyleen got signed to Make It Rain in 2018 with her raw rap, in tune with the aesthetics of todayâ€™s gangsta rap. She draws inspiration from the lineage of female MCs who paved the way in rap music, from Lil Kim, Foxy Brown and Missy Elliott to contemporary artists such as Megan Thee Stallion and Cardi B. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TyLeen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
