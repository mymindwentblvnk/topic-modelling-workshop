Myridian are a melodic death/doom metal band based in Melbourne, Australia. Combining the melodies of epic scandinavian metal with haunting doom passages, the band recorded a three track demo in June 2011, released their debut album ‘Under the Fading Light’ in December, 2012, and followed up with their sophomore 'We, the Forlorn' in April, 2015. Carrying the dark, poignant energy of its predecessor to new heights, 'Forlorn' further refines the band's signature mixture of atmosphere, crushing sorrow and melancholic introspection. Having toured the Melbourne gig circuit over the past few years with many renowned local melodic metal acts, Myridian played at Sonic Forge Festival 2012/2013, Feast of Metal 2014, Metal Obsession's 6th Birthday show, and, more recently, supported Opeth on their 2015 Australian Tour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Myridian">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
