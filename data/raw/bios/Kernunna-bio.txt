Kernunna was founded by Bruno Maia (Braia) in 2012, two years after he had left his main band Tuatha de Danann which eventually re-joined in 2013, contributing to its reactivation after a brief period of inactivity. Since the majority of Kernunna members also play in Tuatha de Danann, Maia decided to keep on touring and playing with both bands.
