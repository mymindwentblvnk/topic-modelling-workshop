Scarnio was the first extreme metal (thrash/death) band in Curitiba. Although they never played outside the country, their demo "Overhear" had a good reception in all South America.

There is a review about the band in Rock Brigade Magazine No. 42 (October 1989) and that the band appears with Skarnio (with "k").
