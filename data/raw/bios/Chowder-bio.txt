Chowder is a cartoon on Cartoon Network created by C. H. Greenblatt (the voice of Fred Fredburger in The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy,) as well as a music artist.

Chowder is nothing if not an amalgam of styles and influences. Since 1992, guitarist Josh Hart and drummer Chad Rush have been writing Chowder’s music, bringing together their early exposure to doom metal, post rock, and hardcore. Although originally a bass player for the Maryland doom metal bands Revelation and Unorthodox, Hart took to the guitar for writing his own original material. Once original bassist Joe Ruthvin left Chowder for MD doom stalwarts Earthride, Chowder remained in limbo until finding bassist Doug Williams. Doug came to Chowder from the band Next Step Up, a band that would feature at different times all three current members of Chowder. It seemed in the cards that these three skilled musicians would ultimately gel their skills into one band: Chowder. Born in hardcore, bred on metal, and nourished by prog, Chowder’s all-instrumental music allows Josh’s precision arrangements and heavy guitar playing, Chad’s technical yet propulsive drumming, and Doug’s deep bass anchoring to rattle walls and turn heads. Fans of The Obsessed, Unorthodox, Rush, Godflesh, Bad Brains, and Fugazi take notice. Chowder released their debut, self-titled CD on Bland Hand Records in August 2007.
