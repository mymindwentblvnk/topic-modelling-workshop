Dorian Grey is a band that started out in late August 2004 as just something to do for fun after school, which soon turned into something much much more. We're just basically 5 dudes in band that love playing and performing music and love all types of music ranging from indie to even rap!! Dorian Grey hasnt even been together for a year, and is already in the process of recording a "Self-Titled" EP set to be released February 2006, and is already booking a tour, and even making a MUSIC VIDEO!!!! We dont like to classify ourselves as just on type of music or "Genre", our influences and "style" ranges from everything. So if you can, try to come out to a show, buy a shirt or something and dont be shy to say hey, we're nice guys and LOVE to meet new people!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dorian+Grey">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
