Gashouse Garden was founded in 2003 by Kristian Ranta of Norther and Jaska Raatikainen of Children of Bodom. Jaska and Kristian had been thinking of forming a possible project band for some time. One weekend night, after some beers, the guys came up with the idea of Gashouse Garden. The band was born and the guys began rehearsing.

Kristian began writing songs and the music began to find its identity. After some time, Jaska asked his old friend Jaakko Teittinen from Craydawn to join the band because a second guitarist was needed due to the nature of the songs. Kristian decided to invite his old friend Lauri Porra of Sinergy, Kotipelto, and Warmen to listen in on a Gashouse Garden rehearsal. After this, Lauri decide to join the band. Now the only thing missing was the singer...

On a winter night Kristian was in a local heavy metal bar, where they feature heavy karaoke and one girl was singing AC/DC so loudly and well that it totally impressed the whole crowd, including Kristian. Kristian decided to ask if this girl (Mertsa/China Cat) wanted to join the band. Mertsa liked the material and subsequently joined the band. Then everyone was happy now that the line-up was completed.

Gashouse Garden decided to record a demo and this demo was soon recorded at Janne Warman's studio in Helsinki.

At the moment Gashouse Garden is looking for a record deal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gashouse+Garden">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
