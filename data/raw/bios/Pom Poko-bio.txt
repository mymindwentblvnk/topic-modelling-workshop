Pom Poko is a Norwegian four-piece group from Trondheim, playing an energetic combination of punk, pop and indie. Consisting of members Ragnhild Fangel Jamtveit (Panda Panda), Martin Miguel Almagro Tonne (Lumikide), Jonas Kr√∏vel and Ola Djupvik, who grew tired of their jazz educated background, and started using all their acquired skills making genre-breaking pop music. With intense grooves, bouncy guitars and in-your-face sing-song vocals, the group is often compared to Deerhoof, Duchess Says and Le Tigre. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pom+Poko">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
