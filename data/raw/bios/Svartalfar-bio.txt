Svartalfar is a Black metal band from Austria. 2000-present 
The Svartálfar (Old Icelandic for "Black Elves") are, according solely to the Prose Edda, Elves living in Svartálfheimr ( "Home of the Black-Elves"). They appear in this source to be identical with Dwarves (Old Icelandic Dvergar). There is otherwise very little evidence for an actual belief in the Svartálfar In pre-christian Scandinavia.
