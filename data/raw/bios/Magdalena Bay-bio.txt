Magdalena Bay are Mica Tenenbaum (Singer/Songwriter) and Matthew Lewin (Songwriter/Producer), who join forces to bring people future 90's-throwback space pop. Over a decade before they were drawing in fans with elaborate release schemes and intentionally tacky graphic design, Tenenbaum and Lewin met as gawky teenagers at an afterschool music program in Miami. They started dating and writing songs together, eventually forming a prog-rock band called Tabula Rosa, releasing two albums and developing a “very small fan base of middle-aged men,” as Lewin recalls. After they went to college in separate states, they broke up, and new music writing stalled. Tenenbaum, the studious one, went to the University of Pennsylvania, where she studied communications and performed with an all-female sketch comedy troupe; Lewin attended Northeastern, where he pursued a music business track, despite having no interest in eventually wasting away at a label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Magdalena+Bay">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
