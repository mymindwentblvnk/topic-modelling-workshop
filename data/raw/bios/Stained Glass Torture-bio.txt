Stained Glass Torture is a metal band forged out of the wastelands of Monroe , MI  in 2003. In a time of confusion, corrupt governments, and where self-prosperity governs all, SGT is about being true to yourself and others, and letting no one control you. Their musick is inspired from their hatred of the world, the beauty of darkness, and all genres of musick, thoughts, and drugs. The very first show they played, they were banned from the venue due to "religious debates," and ever since then SGT has been trudging through shit and fighting to spread their message of hatred and organized chaos, and tearing down all that stands in the way.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stained+Glass+Torture">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
