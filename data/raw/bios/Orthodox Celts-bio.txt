Orthodox Celts is an irish folk rock band from Belgrade, Serbia.

As a popular band playing Irish music, Orthodox Celts are practically unique not only in Serbia but in the whole of Southeastern Europe and further afield. Despite their unusual music, since their founding in 1993 they have been one of the most popular bands in Serbia. Their music led to a popularisation of Irish and Celtic music and other aspects of Irish and Celtic culture in Serbia, especially Guinness beer. The band members are fans of the Celtic F.C., and some of the band's fans are too.

The band started their career with traditional Irish songs and, gradually, introduced more and more of their own material (lyrics mostly by Aleksandar, music mostly by Ana). All their songs are in the English language (or as they say, in the Irish language), but the group has composed some purely instrumental songs as well. In addition, the band has released several videos.

The Orthodox Celts have had several tours and numerous concerts inside and outside of the country (including in the Sava Center, one of the largest concert halls in Serbia). It is already a tradition of theirs to celebrate St. Patrick's Day with a large concert in Belgrade.

In all of the band's interviews, they state that their greatest desire is to tour Ireland!
