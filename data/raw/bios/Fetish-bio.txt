2. FETISH from KOKOMO, IN, USA

FETISH is an all-original Hard Rock quartet from Kokomo, IN. The seat of all great music. Originally formed in 1986 by guitarist Scott "Boota" Carpenter, FETISH has underwent multiple transformations over its long life until finally ending with its current line-up. Keith "KEG" The Sweaty Mexican provides the vocal power of a car-crusher to this powerhouse group. He can sing it all. Scott "Boota" Carpenter is the guitarist and majority writer for the band. Melodic and sweet or just plain dirty and mean, he runs the gambit of sound. Tom Todd is the bone-crushing drum-maniac for the band. Trained in Jazz and Funk, Tom takes out the aggressions of everyday life in a way that makes other drummers cringe and womens asses shake. He really likes the last part!
