When a band like Tacks, the Boy Disaster comes along, it's hard to keep your fool mouth shut. This Austin quartet's music is lush and soft and pretty and folky and gentle and pretty and lush and so on and so forth. Though they've recently completed their full-length debut, those lucky enough to stumble upon this band's Myspace have had the good fortune to hear a revolving playlist of utterly beautiful songs. About the only band I can truly compare them to is The Earlies, but even this comparison doesn't seem quite right. This band sounds like every thing you've ever wanted to hear in a band. Pure, unadulterated sonic bliss, which, of course, makes their debut album HIGHLY anticipated around here. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tacks,+the+Boy+Disaster">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
