SATANIC CORPSE is the dark work of Belita, a spirit channeler, musician and singer, who in essence, channels the dark forces through the body, the Dark Ones using the vocal and instrument vessels to create this music, this music of death.... Main Demon spirits in SATANIC CORPSE are Sir Blasphemy and Infernal. Music is Black Metal, Classical Grand Piano, Possessed Vocals, Death Guitars, Keyboards and Synths from Hell played by Belita. Belita started to play Piano classical style at the age of three and also sing in possessed languages after being visited by a Satanic presence robed in black with horns. In March 2006, Belita became ill and experienced living death... and somehow returned in a somewhat alive state to answer the Satanic calling...  from the ashes... has arisen... SATANIC CORPSE.
