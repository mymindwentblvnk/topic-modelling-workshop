Dienecia is finnish melodic heavy metal band from Helsinki, which have same touch as Mot√∂rhead. The band says that they combine the good old days of thrash riffing and modern metal sound with great melodies all over the place. The band has yet released four demos and one promo record.
Right now Dienecia has little problem with their singer and the lead guitarist and they are searching new singer and guitarist.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dienecia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
