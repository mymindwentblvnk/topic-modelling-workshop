Northern Seer is a progressive power / speed metal band from Helsinki, Finland. It was formed in early 2008 by Mikael Salo and Okko Järvinen who had played together several times. They asked their school mate Otto Ahoniemi to join the band in drums and so the first line-up of Northern Seer was born. The band was later joined by Joose Ylianttila in rhythm guitar. In 2009 Otto’s little brother Antti joined the band as a bass player and in late 2010 Janne Fagerström joined to replace Otto in drums, who left the band.

Current line-up of Northern Seer is:

Mikael Salo: Vocals
Okko Järvinen: Lead Guitars
Joose Ylianttila: Rhythm Guitars
Antti Ahoniemi: Bass Guitars
Janne Fagerström: Drums
