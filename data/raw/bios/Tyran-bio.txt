After two years of looking for their own sound and creating new songs, Tyran is back with a new demo and a new line up. After the departure of Roman Codden ( Guitar ) in 2005, the rest of the band started a search for 2 additional members who could fill the void. The first to join was Kristof Felix who easily picked up where Roman had left. It didnt take much time to find the final member as Kristof knew the perfect person to play the bass. With the addition of Maxime Tyran was finally ready to work out the ideas that had been haunting their minds for so long. Clifford Jordaens decided to scream his lungs out, Robin Helaert developed his drum skills, Niels Praet worked out all of the rifs and the two new members finished it off by bringing new ideas and new skills. With the release of a new demo To Avenge a Broken Heart Tyran is ready to play where ever they can, to help people through music and to be recognised as the hard working band they are. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tyran">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
