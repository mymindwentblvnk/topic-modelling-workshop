Carnal Shroud was a one-man goregrind project from Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany. The sound could be described as being similar to Cadaverous Suppuration - a project Magnus Lundberg started around the same time - old-style, lo-fi, raw and minimalist goregrind in the vein of bands like Dead Infection, Malignant Tumour, Pathologist, Ulcerous Phlegm, etc. After a few years under this name, Magnus Lundberg - the man behind the project - decided to continue under the new name Ulcerrhoea who have become very well received with the grindcore scene. The "Fetus Sanguinolentus" was re-released under the name Ulcerrhoea and on the "Rise For The Downfall" CD, just about all the Carnal Shroud releases appear. Magnus Lundberg was also involved in many such other projects as Cadaverous Suppuration, Netjajev Society System, Syphilitic Vaginas and ran Putrid Nausea Productions
