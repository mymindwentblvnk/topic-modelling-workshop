E-lane is a german Dark NuMetal act originating from Stuttgart. They were founded by guitarist Fabi and singer Sarah in september 2003. For recording the first EP "Awake Your Senses" in summer 2005, bassplayer chriz joined them and has since become a full member. 
Four years (and some rotating of the line-up-carousel) later the time has come: The band had already been able to take a step out of the shadows and received positive response from media as well as from listeners when releasing the first EP “Awake Your Senses”. Now, driven by the high-energy performance of Thommy (drums) and chriz (bass), they are capable of evoking the essence of dark Rock’n’Roll with all their might.

The new EP "Encircled" was released on March 31st, 2007.
