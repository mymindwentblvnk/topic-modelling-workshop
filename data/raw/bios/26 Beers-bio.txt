Hardcore Punk from Boston Proper, MA. Formed in 2003, with 1 member change in 2005. One 12-track Full length (S/T) in 2007, and one 7-track EP (Long Walk, Short Pier) in 2008. Described by others as so many different sub-genres (nu-thrash, metal-punk, street punk, hardcore, "crust-metal-something-core") the band just gave up and just refers to themselves as fast and angry.

Influences include Dystopia, Slayer, Statistics, Testament, Toxic Narcotic, A Global Threat, Cro Mags, Pantera, Sepultura, Coroner, Totalitar, etc. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/26+Beers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
