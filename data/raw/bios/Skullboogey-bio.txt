“Here there is club-hard, dust-dry skirt on the ears. Somewhere in the intersection of magnificent volume such as CLUTCH, FIVE HORSE JOHNSON or also BLACK LABEL SOCIETY and the rockigeren CATHEDRAL settled, present themselves the four Hessen of SKULLBOOGEY as ripe and taste-safe musicians it understand, its compositions a well depended measure of hardness to lend Groove and drive on the one side and a tidy portion of melody and a freedom of movement on the other one… … Power under the line a full affair for those it traditionally and heavy without Metal like!”
