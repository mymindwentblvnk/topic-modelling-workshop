Black Metal, now Neoclassical/Dark Ambient band from Zielona GÃ³ra, Poland.
After the first album the Black Metal influence was reduced and the band decided not to use guitars, bass or any 'typical' Metal instrument, replacing them with symphonic orchestra instruments like piano and violins.
Parts from 'Musaeum Esotericum' album are featured in the polish short film 'Intelekt Kollapse' (2005) as in-film music/score.
