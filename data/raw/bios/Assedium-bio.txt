Assedium is an Italian heavy/power metal band which was born in the beginning of 2004 with the purpose of playing pure epic heavy metal inspired by Cirith Ungol, Omen, Manilla Road, Virgin Steele and old Manowar. 

The band took gradually form and started rocking some stages in Italy, having also the great opportunity to open for Brocas Helm in Ascoli in April 2005. 

In May, they recorded "Far From The Light" demo, still featuring Marco on vocals. Signing with My Graveyeard Productions, they moved onto a new level working on new songs and creating the basis of their first album. 

Marco left the band in April 2006, and the band promptly replaced him with Fils (formerly with Fallen Fuckin' Angels and Deceptor), whose heroic approach to epic metal blesses the sound of the band and completes the mosaic of Assedium's sound. With Luca, they record the soon-to-be-released "Rise Of The Warlords" album... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Assedium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
