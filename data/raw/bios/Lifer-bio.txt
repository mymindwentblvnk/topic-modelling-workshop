1.Lifer is a five piece nu metal band originating from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania from 1999 until 2002, and reuniting in 2018. The band was originally called Strangers With Candy, and consisted of vocalist Nick Coyle, guitarist Aaron Fink, bassist Mark Klepaski, drummer Chris Lightcap and turntabler Tony Kruszka. During their active years, they were signed to Universal Records -- a record deal they secured after a winning performance on an MTV show called "MTV's Ultimate Cover Band Contest" in 2000. Under this label they released a self-titled album in 2001. After their first and only CD, the group disbanded later in 2001. Aaron Fink and fellow band member Mark Klepaski went on and joined the now popular alternative metal group Breaking Benjamin. In 2018, the band reunited with Coyle and Fink returning, Kruszka moving to drums, and Mike Morgan becoming the band's bassist.
