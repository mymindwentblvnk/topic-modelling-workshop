German electronic pop artist Felix Kubin (Birth name: Felix Knoth, Born: 1969) lives and works against the gravity with Sci-Fi Pop/Noise/Animation Films/Radio Plays/Experimental Broadcasting. 
As the messenger of exploding lungs he started his label "Gagarin Records" in 1998 and rules the "syndicate of counter-noise" since 9.9.1999.
His music, beyond his electro-acoustic works as part of the duo Klangkrieg, reflects an admiration for turn-of-the-80s German electronic music of Kraftwerk, Der Plan, Palais Schaumburg and the "Neue Deutsche Welle" (or "German New Wave").
