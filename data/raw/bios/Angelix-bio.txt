AngeliX music speaks to us from a different space and way of being in this human experience. Their sounds originate without time from beyond the here and now. Their awakening is vocally and rhythmically balanced to bring a universal experience to their listeners.
The year 2005 marked the birthing of AngeliX and the collaboration of these two soulful musicians, Fab Soutus and Charla Esser.
Fab Soutus is the composer and creator of the original lush instrumental backgrounds for AngeliX. His creations seem to pour forth a beautiful matrix of energy through the radiant dance of life and be-ing.
With AngeliX he continues to deepen his desire to express his own soul through the universal vibration of sound.
Charla Esser, the voice of AngeliX, is an accomplished a cappella vocal artist, voice teacher and coach. She has spent her life in the pursuit of opening her own eternal voice and assisting others to find theirs. With AngeliX, Charla has found a place to dance, play and express her voice through the melodies, harmonies, vocals and lyrics she creates in symbiotic balance. These healing vibrations enable the shifting of be-ing in our day-to-day world.
