Based out of the Niagara region, leaving their mark everywhere they play, FLATLINED has delivered nuclear shows on every stage they have played on. Blending aggressive, melodic riffs with powerful but evocative vocals, FLATLINED 's sound appeals to a wide audience without losing its distinctive edge. With explosive live performances, touring across Canada 3 times in 2007 alone, and independently selling 5,500 albums along the way, this four-piece alternative rock band is proving they have more than just potential to offer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flatlined">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
