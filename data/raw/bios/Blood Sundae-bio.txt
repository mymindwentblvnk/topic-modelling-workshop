Blood Sundae burst onto the music scene in Leeds towards the start of 2004. Original singer Emily advertised on the internet for female musicians in West Yorkshire and via the internet and friends of friends the band was formed, with Charlotte on bass, Leanne on lead guitar, Anna on drums and finally Vanessa on rhythm guitar.

The gigs came fast and furious, the metal maidens rocking out venues across the north east and west including Leeds Cockpit, Bradford Rio’s and Manchester Roadhouse, earning themselves the title ‘masters of melancholic, gothic metal’ along the way. In 2005 they were proud to be chosen as one of the winners of the prestigious Leeds Bright Young Things competition. 
 
The girls were then lucky enough to be selected for the Dark Angel Project, the brainchild of South African producer Ankha - an incredible opportunity for unsigned bands. They were flown out to Johannesburg for 3 weeks where they recorded their debut album, 
“Here Lies...Blood Sundae”, spanning their earliest tracks to the heavier and darker direction of newer material like the brooding ‘Poisoned Apple.’ A truly awesome experience, the band also recorded two music videos, gave radio interviews and played to crowds of 1000’s.

2006 brought a fresh start for the band as they welcomed new singer Claire into the fold, ending the relationship with Emily that had become increasingly strained. This new beginning sees the band plumb the dark depths of their brutal new direction, now captured on the ‘Aftermath’ demo. With recent blistering gigs behind them and new future ahead of them, Blood Sundae are set for meltdown. “Here Lies…Blood Sundae” is due for limited edition release in 2006 – a testament to where they have come from, and a sweet, metallic taste of things to come.
