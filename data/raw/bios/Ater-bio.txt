There are several bands called Ater:

1) Death Doom Metal band from Finland. Released two demos, "The Black Abyss" (1992) and "Ors" (1993). Drummer of the band plays nowadays in a band called Goathemy (Fin).

2) Black Metal band from Belarus.

3)  Black Metal band from Italy.
Ater were born during september 2005 when Fez (bass) and Shadowmaster (drums) met Neram (voice) and Tiziano (guit). The arrangement of some material begun shortly, black melodic metal with primordial and raw setting in the beginning and more melancholy, epic and sometimes solemn after, alternating glacial and melodic riffs. In 2006, after some gigs with local bands, Tiziano left Ater in November and Fez became the guitarist. With the joining of I (bass) and Samael (rhythmic guitar) the previous songs were rearranged, and meanwhile Fez recorded the demo “Arcane Terre” which obtains a good success & reviews. The band takes part in local fests (some with Fearbringer, Otargos, Nefarium, Frostmoon Eclipse, Esoteric) and the writing of new songs by Fez makes Ater’s style more personal and different from the classic norwegian black metal.
The harmony among the members grows, improving considerably the scenic impact thanks to the employment of torces and fire effects. After many concerts in Piemonte to promote the demo, the band decides to record the first full-length in Chivasso (TO, Italy) at the “One Voice Studio” of Daniele Giordana (sound F.O.H. for Obituary, Metallica, Motorhead and producer for BlackFlame, Mindsnare, Daemusinem and many others) during the summer.
After the mixing, Ater takes part in the shots of the brand new Alex Infascelli’s movie, playing a song that will be part of the movie's soundtrack, which will be released on may 2009 for Sky Cinema.

4) Melodic Black Metal  band from Italy - not to be confused with previous band
Luigi M. Mennella is a very creative and prolific artist. In his long career he played in many Metal bands: 
-) Apostasia (Black/Death Metal: no releases because Mennella decided to spread anything for the mass with this band);
-) Ater (Black Metal);
-) Crepusculum Conscientiae (Experimental Black Metal: one Mini CD recorded but never published);
-) Interzone (Thrash/Death Metal);
-) Necrosis (Death Metal)

Besides these bands, Mennella lately formed many non-Metal projects, some of them very popular also in the Metal scene:
-) En Velours Noir (Dark/Electro Pop);
-) F.ormal L.ogic D.ecay (Dark Ambient);
-) Furvus (Ambient/Folk)
In additions, Mennella did some collaborations with Altar of Perversion and Frostmoon Eclipse.

5) Dark Ambient band from Andorra (http://www.myspace.com/thelostsilence): ATER is one of the projects of Albert B, co-founder of Likantropika, and is perhaps the most peculiar of all. Meditative, mystical, sailing between minimalistic industrialism and horror movie sounds. Ambient from the Pyrenean Mountains. ATER is the dark side of the simple things, like the fear that causes the unknown... ATER is the solitude and the negligence, the passage of time, the secret beauty... ATER is only the life, to be able to understand the death.

6) Black Metal  band from Mexico 
Lyrical themes: Satanism, Demonology, Darkness
