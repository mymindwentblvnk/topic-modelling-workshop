1) Cyrus is the second artist to be signed to The Specktators Collective. Cyrus joined the label in 2015, and released his first album, titled Love, Cyrus, in the same year. His song “Northside” quickly exploded, and achieved over one million listens over different platforms before the end of February, 2016. This prompted him to release a remix of the song in February’s “Speck 16”.

Before joining The Specktators Collective, Cyrus was under the label phourcyRus, with phourthelove producing the beats and cyRus doing the rapping. He released at least one mixtape, titled “Colors and Other Things”, however, it appears all of his old music isn’t accessible anymore.

Since then, Cyrus had slowly released singles from his second album, We Should Just Enjoy Ourselves, which was released on October 28, 2016.
