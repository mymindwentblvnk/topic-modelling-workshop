Cyvoid plays thrash metal that alloys meaty Metallica-style riffs and Voivod-ish math weirdness with the raw energy of bands like S.O.D. and D.R.I. Based in Leeds and featuring current and ex- members of The Plight, Send More Paramedics, Antares and End to Empires, Cyvoid packs a killer punch live and is primed to burn down a stage near you. Cyvoid's 10" EP is out now on TDON Records <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cyvoid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
