The Puhdys are a veteran German rock band, formed in Oranienburg, in what was then East Germany, in 1969, although they had been performing together, with various lineups, as the Puhdys since 1969. They continue to record and tour. Although they are especially popular in their native eastern Germany, the Puhdys enjoyed significant success outside the GDR, and were one of the first East German bands allowed to tour West Germany. With more than 18 million albums sold, they are probably the most successful German-language rock group. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Puhdys">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
