Kode9 (born Steve Goodman in Glasgow, Scotland) is a leading figure in the South London Dubstep scene. As a producer and DJ he most known for his collaborations with MC the Spaceape (aka Daddi Gee). He is also the founder of the pioneering UK label Hyperdub. Along with Pinch, Kode9 was one of the few producers at the dawn of Dubstep not from Croydon. 
Inspired by jungle, dub, drum and bass and the then emerging 2step garage scene (or what he calls the "hardcore continuum"), Kode9 released his first tune '99 on Katasonix and in 2000-2001 he hosted the Hyperdub sessions in London, probably the first club night to push the dubstep sound. 2002 saw the release of the seminal "Fat Larry's Skank" on Tempa, followed by "Babylon" on Tempa and tracks on Rephlex' "Grime 2" comp in 2004. Since then he founded Hyperdub, released two albums and was featured on mix series such as Dubstep Allstars and DJ Kicks. He was also a FWD>> resident and hosted a weekly show on Rinse.

He is often noted for his Memetic Philosophy on music and sonic culture. Steve has a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Warwick and is a Lecturer in Music Culture in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of East London. In 2009 his book, "Sonic Warfare: Sound, Affect, and the Ecology of Fear", was published by MIT Press. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kode9">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
