Nottingham is an alternative/pop/indie/rock group from New Jersey. The band returned to the NJ music scene strongly this past January and is readying to released their new album "Moving Day" on April 28th. Their sound has been described as a mix of Brand New, Jimmy Eat World, The Shins, and Death Cab for Cutie because of their lyrical depth and musical creativity without losing a pop punk edge.


A brief history
The band started young in 2009 and immediately gained enough traction to be signed by Oort Records in which they released their first album 'Talk to Strangers'. From their success with the album they toured briefly across the US. About a year later the band released the Summer EP on their own accord and signed with Soundmine Musicworks to start producing their second album later to be called 'Moving Day'. During these transitions the band hit the local NJ, NY, and PA music scene and opened for touring acts such as Sum 41 and Motion City Soundtrack. However due to a string of unfortunate events the project was put on hold and the band had to take a few steps back to regroup. Nottingham returned to the NJ music scene in late December 2014, with a new year new possibilities mantra, poised to finally release their second album 'Moving Day'.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nottingham">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
