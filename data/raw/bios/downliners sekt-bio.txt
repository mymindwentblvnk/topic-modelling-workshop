The members of Barcelona-by-way-of-France duo Downliners Sekt are hardly newcomers to making music. In fact, the outfit, which has taken on a variety of different formations and sonic aims over the years, has a discography that reaches back almost a decade. Still, it wasn't until the remaining pair of members found themselves in Barcelona a little over three years ago that the group began crafting the trilogy of free EPs which would serve to propel them onto the radar of forward-thinking electronic music heads. Now, with a new single for the Parisian imprint Infin√© just behind them, and a full-length for the same label in the works for next year, Downliners Sekt hopes its fate as an eternal "up-and-comer" is about to change.
