Sonic adventurers, punk rock fundamentalists, exuberant luddites, willing outcasts.

Mekons formed in Leeds, England 34 years ago in 1977 and  Ancient & Modern is their 26th album. This current classic line-up has remained intact since the mid-1980s. Throughout their history, they have worked collaboratively and collectively with everything credited to the band, never to individuals. Their mind-boggling output consistently blurs the lines between high art and low and has included exhibitions in the UK and US, a deranged musical recorded and staged with Kathy Acker, an art performance with Vito Acconci, and several books including the unique art catalog/unfinished novel "Mekons United."
