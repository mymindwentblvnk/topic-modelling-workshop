Graviora Manent was formed in 1991 by Robert Baum (drums and vocals), Michal Christoph (guitar, guitar synthesizer), Darek Was (bass) and Michal Branny (guitar). The band played death and thrash metal styles at first. They released a split tape with Skull Smokes titled The Pain in 1991 and a demo titled Moving Pictures in 1994, and had a record deal with Altheya Project Records.

Darek Was and Michal Branny left Graviora Manent, and in 1995 the band was joined by Ada Szarata (female vocals), Andrzej Walensiak (bass) and Gracjan Jeran (guitar). During this line up change in 1995 they began playing gothic metal, and recorded their first album ...Acta Est Fabula in Poland, 1996. In 1997 they changed their name to Undish. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Graviora+Manent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
