Gorement was a death metal band that formed in 1989 in Nyk√∂ping, Sweden. They recorded their first demos in 1991 and 1992. The "Obsequies..." demo was also released as a 7" through Afterworld Records in 1992. In February 1993 they recorded their one and only full-length album, "The Ending Quest" which was released by Crypta Records the following year. The label ripped the band off badly, and shortly after the album was released the label went bankrupt. All this led to original drummer Mattias Berglund leaving the band. His replacement was Robin Bergh and when he entered the band they also changed musically with a more heavy metal oriented sound. This in turn led to the band parting ways with vocalist Jimmy Karlsson. They decided to change their name to Pipers Dawn in 1996 with a new (female) singer and a new drummer.
