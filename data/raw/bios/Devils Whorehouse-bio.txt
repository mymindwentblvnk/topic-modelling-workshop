Formed in 2000 by bassist Roger Svensson (B.War of Marduk) and guitarist Morgan HÃ¥kansson (Marduk, Abruptum), Devils Whorehouse began as a Misfits and Samhain cover band. After only two rehearsals, the group began writing original material, which they would later release on The Howling. Recently, Roger Svensson left the band and vocalist Zwedda now performs vocals and bass.
In 2012 the band chaged their name to Death Wolf. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Devils+Whorehouse">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
