Sturmkaiser project was born in 2003 to spread war and terror through its music. In just 2 years the band recorded one demo, one full-lenght (in 2 different editions, the first, autoproduced, limited to 200 copies, the second re-printed by Nebelfee Klangwerke) and one EP (relased by the same label), and played some ass-kicking live shows, headlining some gigs or supporting bands as Nargaroth, Absurd and Forgotten Tomb. In 2005 Sturmkaiser formed with other bands from Abruzzo (a region in the center of Italy) the Vrasthema circle (http://vrasthema.interfree.it), as a tribute to its member's homeland. Hail the total war. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sturmkaiser">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
