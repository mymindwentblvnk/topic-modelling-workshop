Placate the Masses started out as a small music project between Josiah Brand in the US and Didier Renault in Canada where Didier would write and record the music and Josiah would write lyrics and record all the vocals. However, as the project grew and more people got involved, it was decided that the project would be taken farther. The band was given the name Placate the Masses by Josiah's father, Phil, and with Didier's brother Andr√© filling in for bass, a long distance collaboration ensued resulting in the release of their independent debut album Conquer All on February 28th 2013. PTM is currently working on new material.

Placate the Masses is a Christian band, which is evident in their lyrics, Facebook posts and YouTube Bible teaching series called Hardcore Christians. Conquer All's music style was written in a more generic style. This was because many songs that were used in Josiah and Didier's project was used for the album and others were written in the same style to keep the writing consistent. PTM's upcoming work has been described by the members as "much more brutal" and that "the bar will be even higher on this one." Aside from the founding members, PTM has had a few lineup changes in the past year. The band has yet to play any live shows to date due to the fact that all of the members are students and are still residents of two separate countries (America and Canada).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Placate+the+Masses">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
