Sotahuuto derives from a band called Catrabbits. Nowadays the band's music style is somewhere around attitude metal, with some influences from hardcore. Sotahuuto's line-up has been intact since the end of 2002. They also got their own mixer in early 2004. So the band currently consists of vocalist Retu, guitarists Pekka and Taneli, drummer Eero, bassist Matti and mixer Jukka.

Sotahuuto officially began to exist in 2003, in Helsinki, Finland when Catrabbits was put to it's final rest. In Easter 2004 Sotahuuto recorded a demo, which was never released. Yet, this demo helped a lot when recording their new album, because the songs were now properly looked through and improved. Their first,  self-titled album was released in August 2005 and it had a very good response from many hard music medias. In 2007 Sotahuuto released their second album, Ihmisen j√§lki.

There has been nearly 50 live shows, mainly in Finland, but also in Norway, Sweden and USA.
