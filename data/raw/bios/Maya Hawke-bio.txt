Maya Ray Thurman Hawke, preforming as Maya Hawke, (born July 8, 1998[2]) is an American actress and musician. She is the daughter of actors Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke. After beginning her career in modeling, Hawke made her screen debut as Jo March in the 2017 BBC adaptation of Little Women and starred as Robin Buckley in the third (2019) and fourth (2022) seasons of the Netflix series Stranger Things.

In August 2019, Hawke released her first two singles, "To Love a Boy" and "Stay Open". The songs were written and recorded by Hawke and Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Jesse Harris. Hawke performed a series of headlining gigs around New York City in early 2020, her first ever solo live performances as a musician. In each of these shows, Hawke was supported by Benjamin Lazar Davis, Tōth, Will Graefe and Nick Cianci respectively.

On March 18, 2020, Hawke released the first single "By Myself" and announced her debut album titled Blush. The album's second single, "Coverage", was released on April 22, 2020, before its music video directed by Maya's father Ethan Hawke was released on the 28th. Initially set for release on June 19, 2020, Blush was delayed to August 21, 2020 amid the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. Hawke wrote, "I feel like this is not a time for self-promotion. It is a time for activation, education and self-examination." To support the release of Blush, Hawke appeared as a musical guest for the first time in her career on The Today Show in late August 2020.

On June 29, 2022, alongside the release of the single "Thérèse", Hawke announced her second album Moss, due to be released September 23, 2022. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maya+Hawke">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
