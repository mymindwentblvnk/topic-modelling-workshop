Linda Leen (born in July 1979, CÄ“sis), real name Linda Feldberga, is a jazz vocalist from Talsi, Latvia. Her first public appearance was at the Latvian Music Awards 1999.

Since their debut album's eruption in 2001, Linda Leen as an artist has grown and evolved, has found her style and manner, her place in music. The new album "Chameleon" is a colorful and musically strong. It can not be included in a given musical style category, as this experiment and full of surprises, vocal event closer to more traditional values - jazz. Emotionally it is a balancing between the male and female, something of a James Bond belief, only feminine interpretation.
