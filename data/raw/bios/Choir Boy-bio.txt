"Choir Boy" was what kids called singer/songwriter Adam Klopp in his early teens when he fronted punk cover bands in Cleveland, Ohio. An intended insult, the label seemed fair and fitting in a way, given Klopp's religious upbringing and angelic voice. After high school, Adam left Ohio for college in Utah. While his career as a student would prove short-lived, he integrated into Provo and SLC's underground music and art scene, left religion behind, and called his new band "Choir Boy".

"It seemed funny to me as sort of a comical reclamation of the mocking title I received from "punk" peers as a teen. While serving as a weird reflection of my childhood and musical heritage."

Since Choir Boy's gorgeous debut LP on Team Love records in 2016, the dream-pop outfit has gained a cult following online and in underground circles, and signed to LA/NY based label DAIS Records in 2017. Adam's stunning vocal range, layered compositions, and heartbreaking melodies are backed by musical partner Chaz Costello on Bass (Fossil Arms, SculptureClub, Human Leather) - and along with a rotating cast of players, create the perfect blend of nostalgia-laced romantic pop music we've been waiting years to hear. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Choir+Boy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
