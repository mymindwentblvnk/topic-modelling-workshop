Formed in 2009 in Las Cruces, NM.  Started out as a d-beat oriented blackened death/doom band, but by their second demo (August 2010) had begun to incorporate more black metal influences, and shortly thereafter embraced that style wholly , incorporating ambient and drone influences from bands like Earth and Wovenhand in an effort to write music that reflects the landscape of the American West, in particular the Southwestern deserts. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yazata">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
