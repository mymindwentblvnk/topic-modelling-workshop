Wyrok (aka Taka Perry) is a Canberra based musician, composer and producer, with experience in a wide range of musical fields. Music without boundaries allows full expression of oneself, and this notion is reflected through the heavy experimentation present in Wyrok’s music. He began learning music in a classical environment, but later branched out to guitar based music, and now self-produces his own music under the moniker Wyrok.

His upcoming EP ‘Wireframe’ is most likely the first album that features a melody played on a frying pan. Consisting of 5 tracks, the EP contains a blend of catchy synth melodies, field recordings, studio-manipulated audio and ochestras. The track ‘Saturday’s Reflection’ features guest artist Gabriel Leopardi (Cirse) on guitar. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wyrok">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
