Social Plague was found in Lille (Northern France) in November 2006 by MickaÃ«l Alarcon (drums, former-singer of Gerbe of Life) and Guillaume Zeller (guitar). Anton Jovanovic (vocals, Nocturnal Fears) arrives in December and Boris Helfer (bass, former bassist of Sepulchral, Nocturnal Fears and Corruption) in January 2007. A repertoire is starting to take shape in the crust/grind style with some hardcore and metal influences. After the live proof the band strikes again with their first CD "A Kind of Opression". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Social+Plague">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
