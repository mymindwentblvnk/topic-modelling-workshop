Shapes and Sizes melodic pop inhabits a world of beauty, noise, whispers, and elusive, contradictory moods, where the dynamic of a steam piston gives way to elegiac understatement, often within one song. With three of its four members writing for the band, their repertoire is one of constant surprise, often going out on a limb, but never falling off.

From Victoria, BC, Canada, but now calling Montreal their home, Caila Thompson-Hannant, Rory Seydel, Jon Crellin and Nathan Gage have shared stages with Frog Eyes, Silver Jews, The Thermals, Architecture in Helsinki, The Blow, Apples in Stereo, The National, Japanther and Yeasayer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shapes+and+Sizes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
