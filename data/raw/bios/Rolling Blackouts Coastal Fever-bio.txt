Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever, also sometimes known as Rolling Blackouts C.F., is an Australian indie rock band. They formed in Melbourne in 2013 by three singer-guitarists: Fran Keaney, Tom Russo & Joe White. Playing bright, energetic indie rock with lively guitar lines, sharp hooks, and dry wit, the Australian quintet turn the clock back to the glory days of '80s jangle pop, but give the sound a tough, no-nonsense attitude. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rolling+Blackouts+Coastal+Fever">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
