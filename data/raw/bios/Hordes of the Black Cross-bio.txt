Hordes of the Black Cross were expelled from the Womb of Death in the Year of No Lord 2010th with Thormentor, Korpse Horde, Hate Blaze and Halla ensnared in the collapsing axis. As the cyclic seasons transformed from darkness to light and into darkness again – and with skeletal, wretched hymns – the beast began to take its heretical final form. Holding high a putrid chalice of Black Metal, and drunk on the chaos of Thrash, Hordes of the Black Cross heralded the execution of live rituals in the decay of Fall 2011th.

“Thus, here and now is the ongoing procession into Chaos, Knowledge, The Self and Death via the black arts.”
