Japanese Extreme doom metal band by the members of ex-Coffins, ex-Psycho To Black, ex-Deathchurch, de-nihil, Congenital Hell, and Morquido. The band create absolutely unique morbid atmosphere by extremely simple and slow rhythms combined with ultra heavy riffs, eerie guitar melodies, and deep disturbing growls! It can appeal to the fans of Khanate,Worship and Rigor Sardonicous.
