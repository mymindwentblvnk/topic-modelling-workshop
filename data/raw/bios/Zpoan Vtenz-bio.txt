Zpoan Vtenz (meaning "The Victory of Vytis" from Prussian) is a Lithuanian folk/pagan black metal band, created in 1994 by Ramūnas Peršonis, the guitarist of two other Lithuanian pagan black metal bands - POCCOLUS and HA LELA, in the town of Utena. In 1998, Zpoan Vtenz released their only album to date, "Gimę nugalėt" with a professinal folk-vocalist Vilma Čiplytė (Goštauta). After a break, the project was reborn in 2003 and the band is preparing two albums (with Vilma Čiplytė) at a time: one is said to be dark-electronic and other - folk metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zpoan+Vtenz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
