There are two artists with this name.

1. Trollhammer is a folk metal band from Salem, Oregon. The band is made up of ex-members of black metal, grindcore, and skate punk bands from the area. Began in 2005. The content is very unknown, due to it's null attempt at marketing or even distributing, as is few physical copies exist of their music, as well as very limited amount of shows were played.

The style that is employed throughout  their first release (Valgrind) is a mixture of neoclassical folk with touches of Spanish rhythm (flamenco-esque at points) and charging bright melodies. It can be considered epic war metal by some, but in most terms it's considered Viking/black metal. The lyrics are of typical Viking/Norse tale fashion.

Disbanded in early 2007, members have no other new bands as of yet other than solo projects.

2. Trollhamer is a folk/Viking metal band from Wisconsin, USA, featuring members of the split-up dumah.

3. Trollhammer is an instrumental heavy psych/proto-metal band from Lakeview, Michigan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trollhammer">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
