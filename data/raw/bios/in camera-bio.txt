In Camera were a London post-punk band, not to be confused with incamera.

Comprised of singer/keyboardist David Steiner, guitarist Andrew Gray, bassist Pete Moore and drummer Jeff Wilmott, London post-punkers In Camera came to Ivo's attention when they opened a show for Bauhaus. Displaying a spiky, PiL and Joy Division-influenced sound on their 1980 debut single "Die Laughing" (the first 4AD release engineered by John Fryer) the group had matured considerably by the time of their IV Songs EP at the end ofthe year.

By 1982 the quartet had fallen apart. The Fin EP was their 4AD epitaph: a Peel session from December 1980 which Ivo licensed from the BBC. It featured the 12-minute monolith "Fatal Day". Gray remained affiliated with the label, co-founding The Wolfgang Press in 1983, while In Camera briefly reformed in 1991 to record some new material for the compilation CD 13 (Lucky For Some). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+Camera">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
