Energy 52 was a short-lived project from German DJs Kid Paul (aka Paul Schmitz Moorman, aka Paul M) and Cosmic Baby (aka Harald Bluechel). 

Back in 1991 they released a couple of tracks, but it is in 1993 that they release their Magnum opus. After hearing Wim Mertens’ piece Struggle For Pleasure in the Ibiza sunset café, Cafe Del Mar, Paul gets inspired by this energetic piano driven piece. Back in Germany Paul and Harald start to translate this energy to the dance floor, Cafe Del Mar is born.

Cafe Del Mar became one of the most heard trance songs in the world, with countless remixes produced.
