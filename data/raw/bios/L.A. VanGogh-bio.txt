"Born Edgar Lamont Anderson, Jr., L.A. VanGogh is a one-man band filling the roles of rapper, songwriter, producer, and occasional singer. VanGogh graduated from the University of Illinois-Chicago with a bachelors degree in Political Science. One could be misled by his name, but L.A. is a current Chicago resident who hails from the Chicago suburb of Dolton. Because of VanGogh's experiences as biracial American citizen, his music tackles the dualities of life discussing the balance of good/bad and right/wrong by using multiple perspectives of gender, sobriety, and social status. VanGogh paints extravagant pictures with the use of slick similes and metaphors, witty wordplay, and multi-rhythm deliveries over his own production, as well as catchy melodic hooks. To go along with his lyrics, L.A.'s production also mirrors the topic of duality with multiple drum, pitch, and melody changes over a melodic and atmospheric soundscape in conjunction with hard-hitting 808 bass and a sprinkle of EDM-inspired sound glitching. Through his musical voyage of figuring out his own identity, he hopes to inspire others to do the same."
