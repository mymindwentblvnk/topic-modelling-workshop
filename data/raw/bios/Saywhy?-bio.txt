Saywhy is quite new Czech fastcore/grind band.

The Saywhy? group rised from band Liquid Pus (Tonda - vocal, Vláďa - drums, Jarda - bass, Pol - guitar) established in 1999.  Changes in band line-up, attitude towards the world and changes in repertoary gave rise to new band in 2005. In Saywhy? are still all members of Liquid Pus plus new frontman Vašek - vocals. Tonda took the post of the second guitarist and backvocalist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Saywhy%3F">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
