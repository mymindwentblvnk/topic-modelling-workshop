Hailing from Finland, Aleksi Per채l채's career in electronic music began in the mid-80s when discovered the wonders of acid-house. However, his real epiphany came later in 1993 when he first heard the music of Richard D. James aka Aphex Twin whilst in Michigan, USA, as an exchange student. Unsurprisingly, the influences of that master of avant-garde electronica shine through on "Project V" as Per채l채 takes us through his latest creations.

Aleksi has also previously made music under the monikers Ovuca and Astrobotnia. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Aleksi+Per%C3%A4l%C3%A4">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
