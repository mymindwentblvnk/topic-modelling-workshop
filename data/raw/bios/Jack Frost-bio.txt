1) The Australian side-project for both Steve Kilbey and Grant McLennan was founded in 1991 with the release of Jack Frost. 
After a hiatus, where both musicians concentrated their energy on their primary bands and solo carreers, the band recorded and released Snow Job in 1995 - this time also including The Church's drummer Tim Powles and Kilbey's brother Russell.
The project is named after the English folklore, elvish character most sililar to Father Winter/Old Man Winter.

2) The Austrian metal band have taken their name from the Saint Vitus song Jack Frost, which should make it clear, where they get their inspiration from. Jack Frost mix doom metal and influences from the gothic scene (such as Bauhaus and Joy Division). Jack Frost give us a modern day look at traditional doom metal mixed in with gothic metal and goth elements. Their music is also reminiscent of Type O Negative.

3) Jack Frost is a rather recent moniker of pioneer Acid House producer Adonis Smith . <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jack+Frost">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
