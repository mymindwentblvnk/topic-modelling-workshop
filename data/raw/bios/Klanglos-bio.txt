Klanglos came into contact with music for the first time in the 90s when the techno scene in Germany was booming. Even at an early age excited by musical sounds of any kind developed a love for the music, as they could not be bigger. In addition to the underground sound quality, uniqueness and clarity of his music is in the foreground. No 0815 techno, but techno with sense, heart and mind, with attention to detail and a passion that you hardly ever see anywhere! This is also reflected in the tracks on which the young DJ and producer works with passion!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Klanglos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
