The Rotted are a metal band formed in England. The band was originally known as Gorerotted but changed their name in 2008 due to musical progression, lyrical changes and to free themselves of the limits their previous incarnation has placed on them. Their debut album Get Dead or Die Trying was released in late June/early July of 2008 worldwide and has received mainstream reviews, the title for the album is a parody of 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin'.

Their new direction has found them producing far more diverse, musically accomplished material, while managing to maintain the catchiness and aggression their previous releases were known for. Having recently completed a short UK tour, the band has had various Summer festivals confirmed, including Wacken Open Air and Summer Breeze Open Air.

In July 2008 The Rotted announced that Wilson would be giving up as bassist, due to new priorities in his personal life which unfortunately meant it was unable for him to commit 100% to The Rotted, his last show with him seen being a member of the band was at Wacken Open Air in 2008.
