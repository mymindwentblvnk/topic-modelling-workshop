NAILSHITTER is a Brutal Death/Grind band based out of Daytona, FL. Originally the band was just a side project between Mike Fortier (ex Neomortem) and Glenn Wilkes (ex Wound Channel). But with obligations to other bands and living in different areas of FL, it was difficult to get things going. Mike (also a promoter in the Orlando, FL area) needed a band for a show that seemed to be plagued with band cancelations. Mike contacted Glenn Wilkes and Robbie Young about starting up this band. With a show booked and only 3 days to practice, the band was able to pull off the show with a great response. Recently Adam Mayberry, formerly of Wound Channel has been added to the band filling in the bass duties. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nailshitter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
