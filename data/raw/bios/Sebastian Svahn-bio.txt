Sebastian Svahn is a Swedish producer of electronic and synthwave music. He started to make music with Commodore computers in the late 80s / early 90s. Inspired by artists like Aphex Twin, Squarepusher and Boards of Canada he made "Blue" and "Gasp". Blue became his most downloaded song thanks to animator David Firth and his animation ”Video dating tape”. Today he mostly (but not entirely) produces synthwave. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sebastian+Svahn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
