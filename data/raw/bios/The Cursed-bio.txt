The Cursed is a stoner / groove doom metal band from New Jersey, USA. They formed in 2006 by Overkill frontman Bobby 'Blitz' Ellsworth (Vocals), ex-Hades guitarist Dan Lorenzo, Job The Raver (Bass) and Drummer Mike Christi (Non-Fiction).

Bobby "Blitz" Ellsworth and Dan Lorenzo began collaborating together in late 2005, and came up with a style that while still heavy, is a departure from the intense Thrash metal of Overkill or Hades. Instead opting for sludge, stoner doomer style of Black Sabbath, Danzig with compound thunderous rhythm guitar riffs with dangerous lead riffs for a catchy sound straight from stoner rock/metal movement (Think sludgy doom thrashers Post Mortem (US)). 

They released their debut album Room Full Of Sinners in 2007 via Screaming Ferret Wreckords which enjoyed press coverage such as Magazine Reviews, a 5/5 rating from CD Universe and a 8.5 rating from All Music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Cursed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
