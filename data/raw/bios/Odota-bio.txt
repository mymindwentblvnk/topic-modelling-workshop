Odota is an Estonian metal outfit of Jarmo Nuutre (Blood Pavilion, Hjem, Knivbisnes, Skull Trading, ex-Talbot) from Tallinn, Estonia.

Started in 2013, this project is now ready to deliver it's first release, the album Fever Marshal. A dose of black metal spiced up with some psychedelia and experimentalism.

"It is an all-out black metal assault on the senses. Droning in delivery, bleak and sinister as a shade. In fact, there is no color here. There is only the pitch-black mass and it swirls and swallows you whole." (JK / Stoner Hive)
