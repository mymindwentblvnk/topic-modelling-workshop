Dragonrider started back in 2001 when Rad left his former band, to create his own band and music.
Having trouble finding Musicians with the same taste in music he moved alone till he formed Valderia then he changed the name to Dragonrider.
the band had many line-up changes until it finally settled down with the current members.

The band combines Speed, Melody and old school elements due to each member's influences, the lyrical theme fights depression it has also a rebellious theme.
The band kept moving until the current line up gathered and released it's 1st Demo in 2008 (Musical Sword).
Later in 2009 Rad got in touch with his old Friend Ala'a Hamdan who has done the Audio Engineering and Production of Moon Serenade E.P.
