There are two bands with this name:
1) Belarusian melodic death metal band,who released "An Angel Dies In My Eyes" album in 2008. It is available for free download.

2) Previously known as Hecatomb, they are a 5 piece metal outfit from the midlands. Amenti take thrash metal back to its roots, utilising fast guitars, fast drums, and distinct hardcore vocals. 

Lyrically and emotionally Amenti convey a message that is much older than their tender years (No band member is over the age of 22) Theirs is the music of war, of ferocity, of pain fuelled by the hell they live in.

Nihilistic and yet always infused with messages of hope, Amenti portray a vision of a world torn apart by greed and jealousy, and yet a world that can be conquered, again, by us. 

Live, Amenti take on another form entirely, standing theyâ€™re own against more established acts like Breed 77, the Amenti live show is a lesson in power and intensity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amenti">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
