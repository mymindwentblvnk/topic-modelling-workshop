Abdominal, real name, Andy Bernstein, is a  Jewish rapper from Toronto, Canada.

Abdominal distinguishes himself from mainstream rap through the subjects he raps about. Instead of rapping about fast cars, guns, etc. - possessions more regularly associated with hip hop. Abdominal , or Abs, raps about a diverse range of subjects: fast food; being a bike courier; relationships and people jumping queues. However, Abdominal injects  more humour into his raps than is normally found in traditional rap.

Abdominal is well known for his skills as a freestyle rapper, or 'freestyler', whereby he raps without script, often about people or events in his immediate surroundings at that point. He has collaborated with a number of high profile artists in the hip-hop/b-boy arena, including but not limited to DJ Format, Cut Chemist (also Chali-2na and Akil, briefly), Ugly Duckling and DJ Fase <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abdominal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
