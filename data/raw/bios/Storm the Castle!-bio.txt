Hailing from Fayetteville, AR, Storm the Castle! breathes new life into Old School, epic Heavy Metal.  Self-described as "riding a lightning bolt towards victory while simultaneously regretting something horrible you've done," the band has received praise from a number of critics for their bold and complex song structures, and avoidance of self-indulgent shredding for its own sake.  Thought they are clearly influenced by Iron Maiden and Iced Earth, Storm the Castle! are quite able to poke fun at themselves while delivering 100% of the recommended daily allowance of metal to their constituency.

Consisting of Douglas Horton, (guitar, vocals) Amjad Faur, (drums) Tommy Atkinson, (guitar) and Joel Bunch, (bass) the band has a string of Northwest Arkansas Music Awards to their credit.  Their 2006 release, "The Free of CHARGE! EP,"  Unfortunately, their 2008 release, "A History of Doomed Expeditions, Vol. 1," is to be their swan song.  While the breakup is an amicable one, Storm the Castle! was "brought to rest as an entity." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Storm+The+Castle%21">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
