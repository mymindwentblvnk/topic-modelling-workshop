Kemerov are from Serres, Greece and they are the brainchild of two guys that grew up with 90’s oldschool deathmetal and Sabbath beliefs, but they could never really choose between the metal sound and the rock n’roll feeling. Giving in to these schizophrenical tendencies, and inspired by bands like Entombed, Cathedral and Turbonegro (among others), they decided to put everything in the mix. They started off in 2013 with guitar, voice and occasionally bass and drums. In the autumn of 2014 and in the summer of 2015, the band acquired permanent members for the drums and bass duties respectively, and there was the first ever full Kemerov lineup. Since then, in November 2015 they released their debut s/t EP.

lineup:
Matt Karampalios – voice
Spiros Diamantidis – bass
Tasos Diamantidis – drums
Giorgos Lezkidis - guitar
