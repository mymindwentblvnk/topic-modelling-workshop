Marc Ducret was born in Paris, France in 1957, and began his professional career as a self-taught musician in 1975, playing with dance bands, folklore groups and singers and doing a lot of studio work.  Interested in a very wide range of styles and instruments (acoustic and electric 12-string guitars, oud, fretless and baritone guitars), Ducret was a member of the first National Jazz Orchestra in France in 1986, and also led his own trio which gave many concerts and performed in numerous festivals in France, Germany, Sweden, Italy, Africa, India, and Japan.  Ducret also performed with Larry Schneider, David Friedmann, Michel Portal, Joachim Kuhn, Franco Ambrosetti, Didier Lockwood, Eric Barret, Miroslav Vitous, Enrico Rava, Adam Nussbaum, Django Bates, David Sanborn, Joey Baron, Michel Godard and others.

Since 1991, his collaboration with saxophonist Tim Berne has made Ducret one of the few European musicians regularly playing overseas.  Frequently invited to be a guest soloist by groups, composers and radio programs in Germany, he created his own tentet "Seven Songs," exploring the music of the '60s with a very personal touch, and plays regularly with Louis Sclavis and Dominique Pifarely's Acoustic Quartet.  He has also recently collaborated with the band AKA Moon and with percussionist Bobby Previte in duet and the quartet Latin for Travelers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Marc+Ducret">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
