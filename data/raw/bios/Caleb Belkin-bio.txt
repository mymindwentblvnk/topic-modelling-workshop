Caleb Belkin is a beat producer from Southern California. He started producing music during his freshman year of high school borrowing a friends equipment, and then saving enough money to buy his own, which was a used Maschine MK1 off of craigslist. Towards the end of high school, he started to connect with other beatmakers through Twitter and Soundcloud.
He is most known for his older songs that he made during 2015-2016, most notably “Lost Samurai” and “I Fall in Love Too Easily”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Caleb+Belkin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
