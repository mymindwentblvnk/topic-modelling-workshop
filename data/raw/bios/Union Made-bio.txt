This entry is about "Union Made" founded by Denis "Snake" BÃ©langer (Voivod). 

This band was Denis "Snake" Belanger's outfit during his hiatus from VOIVOD, but they only released one 7" during their lifetime. They recorded an album for the Anti-Trust label, but the band folded before it could be released, so with no band to promote the album, the label shelved it. 

The unreleased album was put up as a free download on the Voivod fan-site Voivodfan.com:
