The Icehenge project was officially born in 1998 from an idea of Rexor Velthasclan (Altar of Perversion) and Harus, thanks also to Velthar’s initial help on drums. Yet, the early embryonic traces of tracks date back to 1993/94. The first real line-up was found that same year: Harus-vocals, Aidoru-guitar, Rexor Velthasaclan-bass and Sulphur-drums. Still the same year Aidoru quits the band to take ahead a solo project and is substituted with Martinel (ex-Burian), guitar and Harigast (ex-Doom Sayer), guitar. In 1999 the band name changes from Icehenge to Grimorium after pressures by Sulphur and Harigast and the first divergences between the band members appear. The first demo tape, “Oscuro Culto” is released between December 2000 and January 2001. In 2001 Harus leaves the band and is replaced the following year by Malex on vocals. Ever growing contrasts between the band members take Grimorium to an unavoidable split-up in 2002. The same week the band is reformed by Rexor V. and Martinel with the old name: Icehenge. That known, Harus comes back in the band and also SargatanaS (ex-Burian) and Velthar do join. The new line-up is therefore composed by Harus on vocals, Martinel and SargatanaS on guitars, Rexor V. on bass and Velthar on drums. 2003 sees Harus leaving the band once again and Icehenge decide to suspend their activity for various reasons, starting again in 2004 with the composition of new material. In 2006 Varghar Necron (ex-Burian) joins the band ..boards but decides to leave soon after for personal reasons. In 2007 Martyr (Entropia) and Chiara join the band on vocals and keyboards respectively. Few months later the decision to exclude keyboards is taken so Chiara leaves the band. In 2008 the CD “At the heart of Titan” is finally released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Icehenge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
