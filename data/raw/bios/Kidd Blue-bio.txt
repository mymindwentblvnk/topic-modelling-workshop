2)Kidd Blue is truly an East Alabama original. Formed in 1985, Kidd Blue and the Blues Kings began wowing audiences as the house band at Denaro's on Toomer's Corner in Auburn, Alabama. Word spread about "the Kidd" (literally) - fresh out of high school with a soulful growl that brought back the sounds of Sam & Dave, James Brown and Wilson Pickett. 

With the release of their 1988 recording (on cassette only), "Don't Mess With My Shades," the band was chosen as a Southeast finalist in the MTV Rock n' Roll Challenge (curiously, this event was MC'd by Jacko, the Eveready battery guy from Down Under - talk about an 80's trivia question!).

For over 24 years Kidd Blue has been delivering their eclectic mix of Rock n' Roll, Soul, R&B, 80s and Jazz favorites to packed dancefloors all over the southeast. With some of the most talented local and regional musicians on board, it's no wonder Kidd Blue is a favorite choice for weddings, corporate events and fundraising galas from Chattanooga to Tampa.

Band members include David Swanger on guitar, George Whelchel on bass, John Halley on Drums, Kenyon Carter on saxophone, Andy David on trumpet and keyboards and Tim Chambliss on vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kidd+Blue">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
