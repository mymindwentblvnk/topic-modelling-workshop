Terrific Verdict were a Thrash Metal Band. They were formed in the late 1980's in Helsinki, Finland and went on to release two demo tapes before disbanding. The band's style has been compared to Slayer,with aggressive thrash a la Slayer's "Reign in Blood"; featuring short fast tracks with sharp riff-age, and leads which are short and a bit chaotic, in the Kerry King vein.

The band members names were:

Korpi - vocals and lead guitar
Mikko- lead guitar
Ande - bass
Ippu - drums <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Terrific+Verdict">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
