Sam Khatam better known as Persian Empire is a young upcoming producer from Germany.
Music was always a big influence in Sam's life, therefore it's hard to date the beginning of Persian Empire. After traditional music lessons in his youth, Sam discovered the great variety of the electronic music scene, which he became acquainted with.
In 2011 he started to produce his own compositions, by using selfmade sounds along with edited samples. The self-taught artist deconstructs the traditional structure of music and transforms his samples into a detailed electronic sound. Smooth synthesizers, deep bass beats and experimental vocals create harmonic compositions, which extend the diversity of the "bass" and "2-step" genre. When he isn't producing his own music, Sam is collaborating with selected artists from around the world and gets featured in numerous blogs and mixes.
In a short period of time he found his own way of expression to meet with good response within the community. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Persian+Empire">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
