Пойманные Муравьеды -Poimanniye Murav'edy(The caught Anteaters,Lospuercos,LostMurav'edos).For four-year-old history of existence structure PM has undergone some changes, and for today looks as follows: Pavlovski-percussion instruments; Nevelev - базз; "Horhe" - an electroguitar, vocal; Hose - singing; Chino - singing. Musical predilections of participants of collective are rather inconsistent and various, that should find displays to sound cloth PM.
 Somehow to characterize style in which the collective works, musicians use the term of "Dub-Metal-Latino-Trash". " Generally we play fuckin punk-rock " . The punk not under the form and not under the maintenance, and on spirit. So to say, on emotional filling. 
Lyrical hero PM - the such pseudo-macho living in sleeping areas. The fan of binge and foul language, rough and ill-bred, but not deprived charm and warm-heartedness. Text structures are plentifully seasoned by citations and references to cult literary works and a cinema and not normative lexicon. from:www.lospuercos.ru <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5+%D0%BC%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%8B">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
