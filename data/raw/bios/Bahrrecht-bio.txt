Formed in Lorraine, France in 2001 by Fëanor and Winterhalter, the original line-up was: Fëanor (Guitar), Winterhalter (Drums), Normannorum (Guitar), EMI (Vocals). 
In 2005, the band recorded their first demo "Black Metal Way of Life" after being joined by Thulsa Doom to replace EMI. Normannorum left the band a couple of months later.

In early 2006, Sargatanas of Funeral Holocaust joined the band on bass guitar and Bahrrecht decided to venture into another musical direction with faster and more warlike songs. During this time Winterhalter worked with Peste Noire and Amesoeurs, releasing several successful albums. 

March 2010 saw the release of the second demo "Lotharingen" followed by gigs around Metz such as the Barbed Wire Night Festival and Beast of Riot Fest.

German label Ketzer Records released the first LP "Nuit de Neige" in Fall 2011. Described as "Old School Grimm Black Metal" the album was mastered at the famous Drudenhaus Studio with artwork done by Fursy Teyssier. Shortly after the release, Nehsit joined the band as a second guitarist.

Currently, the band is working on its second album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bahrrecht">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
