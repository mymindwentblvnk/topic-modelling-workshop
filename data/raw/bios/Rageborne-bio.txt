Rageborne is a four-piece melodic death metal band from Herning / Aarhus, Denmark. Formed in 2004. 
The band currently consists of vocalist Jesper Øgaard Johannesen, drummer Martin E. Kilic, guitarist 
Kenneth Avnsted and bass player Michael Nielsen.

In October 2006 Rageborne released their first demo, D.N.A. Overdose on MySpace exclusively. In March 2007, it was also released on CD.

The demo was recorded by Ziggy at ZigZound Studios (Mercenary, Hatesphere, Illdisposed), and the cover-art was done by Mircea G. Eftemie from Cadaverman Media (Meshuggah, Fear Factory, Soilwork, Malevolent Creation), though Mircea is commonly known as a guitarplayer in Mnemic.

In 2007 Rageborne was nominated for Danish Metal Awards in the category “Talent Of The Year”.
In March 2008, Rageborne signed a contract with RockZoo Booking Agency - a Danish upcoming booking/management agency.

The band is preparing their debut-album "When All Begins To Blacken" to be released in 2009.
