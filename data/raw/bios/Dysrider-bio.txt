Dysrider is a Symphodeath Metal band from Morges, Switzerland. Originally created under the name Trophallaxy in 2007, the band has released two studio albums and a demo.

Playing initially an effective but traditional Symphonic Metal, the band has continued to evolve in a more aggressive style by incorporating more elements specific to Death Metal. The contrast between the sweet voice of the singer JoÃ«lle, her cello and the keyboard, with the Death vocals of Jonathan, rapid and violent rhythmics of the guitar, the bass and the drums, is even more striking and original.

After all the praises that "Resilience" received, the last album released in March 2013, Dysrider will release a new album in February 2015 which promises to continue the rise of the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dysrider">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
