Medieval Bagpipes, combined with pounding guitar, thundering bass and blasting drums, supported by an impressive pyroshow - that's Cantus Levitas. Hailing from Suabia (Germany), their genuine Medieval Folk Metal with catchy melodies and lyrics in languages from all countries and times - e.g. Latin, Icelandish and Old French - turns every concert into a special event.

Cantus Levitas was founded in 2007 as an attempt to take the music of German Medieval Folk Rock bands like Subway to Sally, In Extremo or Schandmaul to a heavier, more "metal" level. Thus they combined heavy riffing with the catchy melodies from bagpipes, flutes and accordeon and many other medieval instruments.

The band has two different programmes: There is the Folk Metal programme on the one hand which was already described, but there is also a purely acoustic, much more medieval programme especiallly for medieval festivals and suchlike. Of both these programmes they recorded, produced and published a CD each on their own: Feuertaufe for the Metal programme and Mit Sack und Pack for the Folk programme.

In 2009, this folk programme also led them on their small "Vivre Ivre"-tour through the streets and city centres of north-eastren France.
