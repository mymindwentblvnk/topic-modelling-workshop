2. An American Metal band, active and continuously gigging and recording since 1995. No songs about dragons, mystical journeys, or castles, just hard hitting pure metal with aggression, melody, and a slight attitude problem. Fans of Maiden, Iced Earth, old school Metallica, and suchlike will probably find something to like here. The band still tours actively and released their fourth CD, "Control Issues", in March of 2010. http://www.division-usa.com or http://myspace.com/divisionusa
