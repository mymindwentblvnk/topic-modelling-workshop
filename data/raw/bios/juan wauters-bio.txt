Uruguayan singer-songwriter Juan Wauters exists somewhere at the cross-section of debonair and everyman, a phenomenon likely explained by his teenage migration from Montevideo to Queens in the early 2000s. After signing to Captured Tracks, Wauters quickly became a fixture of New York's DIY circuit, providing lead vocals and guitar for pop-punk project The Beets and releasing several solo albums, including 2014's Who Me? and 2015's N.A.P.: North American Poetry. In 2019, after embarking on a long spiritual and creative endeavor through Latin America, Wauters released La Onda de Juan Pablo (The World of Juan Pablo), which saw Wauters integrating his native language of Spanish into his work -- showcasing a meandering, blissful folk tune that finds solace in the beauty of life's minutiae. He currently performs with vocalist Carmelle Safdie (of Beachniks) and vibe-maker-in-set-and-lighting Matthew Volz.
