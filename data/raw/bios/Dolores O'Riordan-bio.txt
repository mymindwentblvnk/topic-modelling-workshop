Dolores O'Riordan was the youngest of seven born and raised in Ballybricken, Limerick, Ireland.  In 1990 she auditioned and won the role of lead singer for a band called The Cranberry Saw Us (later changed to The Cranberries). The band released five albums before they took a break in 2003.

Her first solo album Are You Listening? was released in May 2007. Her second solo album No Baggage was released in August 2009.

While in London, England, for a short recording session, Dolores died suddenly on 15 January 2018 aged 46. The cause of death was drowning due to alcohol intoxication.
'Dolores was discovered “submerged in the bath” at the time she was found, and an examination of her body found no signs of injury or self-harm. There was a bottle of champagne, as well as five miniature bottles of alcohol, plus containers of prescription drugs. The toxicology report showed that Dolores’ blood had “therapeutic” levels of medication, but her alcohol level was astronomically high — four times over the legal limit of driving.' <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dolores+O%27Riordan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
