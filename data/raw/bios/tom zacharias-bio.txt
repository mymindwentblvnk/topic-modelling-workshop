In the early 70s legendary genius, madman, musician, lyricist, singer, poet and actor Tom Zacharias together with the cream of Swedish studio musicians, some beautiful Swedish hippie nymphs and a bunch of drugged out freaks recorded two ultra rare LPs called "Belinda" and "Belindas Daughters" both of which are now mega rare collectors items that never turn up, even in Sweden. These two masterpieces with their XXX-rated lyrics were recorded with both Swedish and English lyrics, but only the Swedish language versions were released. The records were never sold in regular record shops but exclusively through advertisements in men's magazines and porno shops and sold pretty well. The re-issue of Belinda contains the songs in Swedish and also in English for the first time ever. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Zacharias">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
