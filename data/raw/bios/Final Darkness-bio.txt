Former Into Eternity guitarist, Rob Doherty's project.

The project was put on hold when the label it was originally to be released under changed priorities and decided to go in a different direction, but Rob remained determined to push forward and bring Final Darkness to life. Doherty rewrote and reworked some of the songs from the original project and began recording the new music earlier this year at Touchwood Studios. The recording was engineered by Justin Bender (Into Eternity), who also provided additional guitars on the track “Memories”. The album also featured guest performances from Tim Roth (Into Eternity) on the songs “Kill Room”, “Memories” and “Darkness Falls”.

A big break came when legendary producer/engineer Neil Kernon agreed to do the final mix for the project. Neil also helped hook Rob up with mastering engineer Alan Douches from West West Side Music to help give the album a killer sound. The full album was released on December 21st, 2011.

Rob Doherty passed away on December 21st, 2012 thus ending the band.
