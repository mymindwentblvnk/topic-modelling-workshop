The Allergies are a duo from Bristol, United Kingdom. Since forming in 2012 The Allergies have made it their mission to reshape funky vintage sounds for the modern dancefloor.  Both skilled turntablists in their own right, the duo of DJ Moneyshot & Rackabeat first bonded over their love of classic hip-hop and beats, then decided to pool their knowledge and skills into making their own music.

Along the way they’ve racked up two ‘Tune of the Month’ awards in Mixmag, topped digital charts, and helped headline the BBC 6 Music festival in their native Bristol last year. In 2015 they were snapped up by Jalapeno Records, and dropped their debut album, As We Do Our Thing, a year later. The LP took in all their funk, soul, disco, hip-hop and breakbeat influences, and featured guest vocals from HypeMan Sage, BluRum13 and Ugly Duckling’s Andy Cooper, who mesmerized in lead single/video, Rock Rock.  

The Allergies’ second album, Push On, is set for release in the summer of 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Allergies">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
