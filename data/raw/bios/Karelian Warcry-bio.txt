Karelian Warcry is Finnish band playing Black\Death Metal.

2001: Pre-History of Karelian Warcry
Pre-history of the band dates back to the year 2001. Sami Ukkonen, Henrik Järvinen, Jarkko S., Matti Mikkonen and Anttipekka Heiskanen started to play together at Kuusankoski, Finland. First songs were covers from bands like Mayhem, Impaled Nazarene and Immortal. Sami had already composed couple of songs himself, but it was more fun to play songs like ”Deathcrush” or ”Blashyrkh” twentyfour times and then head to the local gas station at 4.00 AM. In the beginning of 2002 Matti went to fullfill his duties in Finnish Defence Forces and band started to collapse gradually. During the year band didn't have any name and didn't record any material at all. Still, the flame of Ikirouta remained in the fellow minds. -------------------------------------------------------------------------

2002: Karelian Warcry
It was until December, 2002, when Matti, Sami and Anttipekka gathered again and started to play together in the Anttipekkas parents garage in Kouvola. Samis idea and name ”Karelian Warcry” was launched. Also more and more composed songs were made by this trio. Some of their rehearsals were recorded with famous nipple-tape-recorder. Karelian Warcry had grown roots that cannot be torn.

2003: Draft and Sami Secedes
There was a urgent need for a lead-guitarist so Matti could concentrate on vocals better. Jussi Kousa joined the band in the summer and he started to compose songs with Sami and Matti. Sami left the band in the end of the year to concentrate on his other band projects. Henrik was ablaze about the band and he took over bass. This was the beginning of concrete warfare.

2004: First Mobilizations
In the spring 2004 band rehearsed a lot and finally gave birth to the first demo-recording ”Demo '04”. Recording session was held in the Henrik's sauna. Sami did quest vocals for the song ”Ikirouta” while refrigerator droned in the back. Also a massive demo release party was held. In autumn Karelian Warcry headed to the small studio in Vuohijärvi(Goatlake) to record ”Kylmä rautainen”. It is rumored that the Warmachine and comrade themselves visited in the backwoods during that week.

2005: Public Manifestations
”Kylmä rautainen” was self-released in January. Only 100 handnumbered copies were printed at first. Karelian Warcry played first gigs during this year. Seven Gates of Hell intrested in re-releasing the album as a digipack, limited to 500 copies. Both of the issues are sold out now. Song ”Minun aikani” was recorded for Miasma magazine's compilation. The year ended in sleet.

2006-2009: The Years of Evacuation and Trauma
Karelian Warcry was evacuated to their very own rehearsal chamber in spring 2006. Soon the battery quiet down, Anttipekka was the next in line to fullfill his duties in Finnish Defence Forces in July 2006. In November 2007 Karelian Warcry started to record album ”Verinen taival, päättymätön tie”. There were many major adversities during the process. Band made only couple of public appearances during these years. The bands roots also scattered around the land.

2010: Next Engagement
Frontlines are now re-organized and ”Verinen taival, päättymätön tie” finally sees the daylight. We all are now walking on this bloodfilled journey, never-ending path.
