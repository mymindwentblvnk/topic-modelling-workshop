Bathed in Blood is a black, death, thrash band from Niagara Falls. The idea came about to make a band one late night at Tim Hortons. Over a few coffee's and a few joints they came up with the name Bathed In Blood. All that was left was the music. First time they played together, they went through as many Cradle of Filth, Pantera, or whatever covers we could think of. Many practicies and many nights of pot smoking and beer drinking, they came up with 9 songs. After they put together said 9 songs, they decided to record 7. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bathed+In+Blood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
