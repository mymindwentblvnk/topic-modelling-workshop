Flatstick was originally a two man project between Melbourne (Australia) musicians, John Sanders (AKA: Doug Steele) and Gary McKay (R.I.P.). The sound created by the two is best described as Faith No More meets Strapping Young Lad meets Frank Zappa meets Meshuggah meets Pantera meets Mr. Bungle meets Korn, and a dash of jazz (and a slice of electronic dance). Think thrashy, technical Metal with progressive twists. 

Flatstick have (to date) one full length record titled Omnicore, which saw the light of day in 1999 / 2000. A second full-length is in the works. The Omnicore album is out of press, but you can download the entire thing at full CD quality from their web site (link below).

Gary McKay passed away in 2006 from cancer. Flatstick were at the time working on album number two.

John / Doug has put together a band and is currently rehearsing the Omnicore material plus some new songs which will go on the second album. They plan on playing live before releasing the next album.
