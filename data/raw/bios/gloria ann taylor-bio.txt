Gloria Ann Taylor began as Gloria Taylor, singing Northern Soul sides with an uncanny touch of Dolly Parton. As Disco approached however, Taylor and her husband Walter Whisenhunt changed tack somewhat, eventually creating 'Deep Inside of You', one of the most expensive private press 12 inches you could hope to find. It's much sought after to this day, and with good reason; it's a stunningly skewed interpretation of disco music, earthy and spaced out simultaneously. A stoned fug of a mix gives rise to off-beat drums, spiraling glockenspiels, plaintive violins and guitars that range from proto-metal squalls to keening slide work. On top of it all, Taylor's haunted quiver of a voice spins rudimentary harmonies and gibbering melisma into some of the most touching and deconstructed soul music ever made. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gloria+Ann+Taylor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
