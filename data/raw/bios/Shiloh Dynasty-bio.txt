Shiloh Dynasty is a mysterious singer-songwriter, who first gained traction on the social media platform Vine. With a lo-fi, simplistic, emotional approach to her music, Shiloh amassed a steady following. Her first exposure to the mainstream was when her vocals were heavily sampled on the late XXXTENTACION's debut studio album "17", which debuted at No 2 on the Billboard 200. Since then Shiloh has collaborated extensively with other producers to create moody, hip-hop flavored ballads. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shiloh+Dynasty">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
