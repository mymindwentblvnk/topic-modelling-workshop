Slaughter Towen is a one man project from Leiden, The Netherlands. The name comes from a story by Stephen King called "Crouch End". Slaughter Towen is a street in an old part of London where the Ancient Ones (Nyarlathotep, Azag-Thoth, Yog Soggoth etc) prey on human beings. According to the story a slaughter towen was the place where ancient druids performed their bloody rites and made human sacrifices to the old gods. Slaughter Towen is totally dedicated to old school and necro sounding death/thrash/black metal, hence the style is dubbed as "necrocore". Everything from the cover to the lyrics has to be total necro. Slaughter Towen is thus very influenced by Hellhammer, early Bathory, Ildjarn/Sort Vokter, Beherit, Autopsy and so on. Until now Slaughter Towen has released 5 CDemo's; 
- Het Fanx Uughn     (2003)
- Xodwut Houg        (2004)
- Necronnhen R'lyeh  (2004)
- Urrhdreunnh         (2006)
- Gravvtakkhe          (2008)
As for now it is a bit uncertain if ST will continue, but it is sure that at least one more demo will be recorded.
