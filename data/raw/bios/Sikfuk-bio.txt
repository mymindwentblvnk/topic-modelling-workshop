A brutal death metal band from St. Paul, Minnesota with deep guttural vocals.  They formed in 2001.  Sikfuk has released three full-length albums, two demos, three splits and a live album.  They disbanded in 2003 and went by the name Pocket Pussy Hash Pipe.  They disbanded again and reunited in 2005 as Sikfuk.  They initially started off with  Nick "Tardgrinder" Blanton (vocals, guitar),  Dwayne "Stein" Reynolds (bass) and  Mark "Cpt. Blaa" Rawls (drums).  They recorded the first album Gore Delicious.  Sikfuk also had other drummers as time went by.  Then it was reduced to a one person project only consisting of Blanton doing all vocals and instruments.  Today the band consists of Nik "Nikfuk" Blanton (vocals, guitar, bass and drum programming) and Loogie Lobber Lezlie (backing vocals).  Loogie Lobber Lezlie is Blanton's wife. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sikfuk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
