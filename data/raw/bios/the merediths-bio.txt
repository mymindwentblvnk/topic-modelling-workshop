The Merediths are Brian Haulter (drums), Jesse Lucas (bass), Joe
Meredith (lead vocals, guitar), Jonathan York (keyboard, backing
vocals) and Mark Bryant (guitar). Before they began playing live
shows, the band had already spent considerable time in the studio
developing a signature sound that caught the Louisville, KY music
scene off-guard. With roots and influences ranging all the way back
to the Beatles, they stay true to the craft of music while exploring a
range of modern styles and genres.

A Closed Universe marks the Debauchery Records debut for the
Merediths. A five song EP built on the success of their self-released
demo, it covers new ground for the band with Right There and Let's
All Live Underground in the midst of bringing three local favorites to
the national market. Marmalade Maggie, Cruel Kind of Love, and
Homo Erectus have all received regional radio airplay and
demonstrate some of the band's deep repertoire of sounds. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Merediths">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
