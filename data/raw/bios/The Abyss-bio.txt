Released early 2013 their single "Liquid" with B-side Screams For Help. They are currently working on their first full length album due out mid 2012 entitled "Broken". 
      Melodic hard driven bass lines fill your head while empowering drum mechanics lock everything together. Seanâ€™s unique voice and deep lyrics touch a familiar sadness everyone has endured at some point within their lives while grasping onto hope and chance for a better future. All this doused with the right amount of effects to capture the mood, vibe, and atmosphere, The Abyss stands out on their own upon a sea of imitators in a new world of alternative music. They have been coined as America's Edgier version of The Cure.
