Red Harvest was an industrial metal band from Oslo, Norway.

Formed in 1989 as a thrash project, the band released their first demo Ocultica that year, before releasing their debut album Nomindsland in 1992. From 1994, the band moved towards an experimental hybrid of prog, Gothic rock, and doom metal on There's Beauty in the Purity of Sadness (which spawned a video for the opening track "Wounds", gaining the band exposure on MTV), The Mazt√ºrnation, and Hybreed. In 1997 the band reached a wider audience supporting US goth-metal act Type O Negative.

With 1998's EP New Rage World Music the band perfected their unique progressive industrial tinged sound, and their follow-up Cold Dark Matter was released in 2001 to very strong reviews. In 2002, Sick Transit Gloria Mundi was nominated for a Norwegian grammy and an alternative grammy in the Best Metal Album category. The band released their latest album, Internal Punishment Programs, in 2004.

Their current sound draws elements from industrial metal bands like Godflesh and Ministry, the experimental doom of Neurosis, Voivod-influenced prog-thrash, fellow Norwegian black metal bands like Emperor and Darkthrone, and certain styles of electronica such as drum'n'bass, EBM, and gabba.

According to their official Website, www.redharvest.com, Red Harvest disbanded in May 2010, stating no specific reasons for the breakup. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Harvest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
