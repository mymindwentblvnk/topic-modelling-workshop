He first attracted attention in 2011 with his series of 'Conceptual Mixtapes' released independently on Bandcamp. The following year brought Vanzet's 'Voyages' EP. On the strength of these releases, Vanzet signed to Australian label Future Classic, which issued his forth mixtape 'Lessons' on vinyl in 2014.
