Band was formed in february 2007 in Vranje (Serbia). Deeper Down started as a four member band but they changed line up after a few gigs and decided to put second guitar in the band, in order to improve their live sound. Since the begining, band was concentrated on playing and composing their own songs. The sound is black Metal with influence of thrash, death metal and melodic music. First demo “Insanity I
ncarnates Despondency” was made by their own production. Band has finished their first EP “Evocation” in Archsound studio in Belgrade. Lyrics include post war syndrom, depravity of mankind, misanthropy, madness.
EP “Evocation” will be available for free download by the end of the september 2012. Band is looking forward for more live performance and interactions with other serbian bands.
