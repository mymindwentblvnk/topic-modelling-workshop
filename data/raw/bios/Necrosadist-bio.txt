Emerging from the abyss during the fifth year of His new millennium, Necrosadist seek to capture the essence of the Alpha Nihil through the medium of Raw Necro Violence; a virulent musical manifestation of profane devilry and intense fanatic savagery augmented by doom-laden moments of occult psychedelia and nightmarish blasting chaos. Possessed by the immense power of the Riff, grappling with the innumerable odious dripping tentacles of Black and Death Metal and tapping inspiration from all veins that lead to the one true God, Necrosadist overcome all insurmountable odds and intense hardships to vomit forth a conceptual vision which provokes, evokes and lays waste to all expectations. You are nothing but flesh.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necrosadist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
