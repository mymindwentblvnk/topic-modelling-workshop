Gothenburg, Sweden ( N/A - Present)

Biography
The Weakening is a five-piece band from Gothenburg, Sweden. We play metal, the groovy and percussive kind. We have played several shows in Sweden, Norway and Finland with bands like Entombed, By Night and Avatar. Our musical goal is to combine polyrhytmic brutality with groove. With lyrics critical against today's society this turns to a cleansing mixture of aggression and enlightment. So, go ahead, put up your feet and let The Weakening take you on a journey through our personal hell and back again.
