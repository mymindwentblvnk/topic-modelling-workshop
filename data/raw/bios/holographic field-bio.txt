Holographic Field is the solo project of the Berlin-based pianist, composer and producer Jonas Meyer, who is also involved in the post-rock band Frames.  On his debut record „Window Gazer“, he combines his musical backgrounds and inspirations. Epic ambiences meet clubby electronica, neo-classical and postrock elements. Dreamy soundscapes meet their gloomy complement. Dark meets bright, near and far are searching their balance. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/holographic+field">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
