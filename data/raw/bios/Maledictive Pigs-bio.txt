With their fourth long player "Soul Surgery" German Deathers MALEDICTIVE PIGS come around again. As I do not know the old discs of the band, I can’t really comment on their evolution, but the band lashes out pretty much straight ahead, but without forgetting several breathers in forms of some breaks and slower parts. Only the monotonous boar grunts, meaning the vocals, are unnerving, apart from that not a bad album.

 

Just that the CD does not shine in the vast sea of similar bands whatsoever. Who still puts a big emphasis on brutality and has a faible for old Death/Grind, will still not regret the purchase of this album. The 10 own compositions are complemented by a hidden track, the ULCEROUS PHLEGM cover version "Consequence". I’d most recommend this CD to fans of old Earache slaughters such as REPULSION, TERRORIZER and BOLT THROWER’s "Realm Of Chaos" album.
