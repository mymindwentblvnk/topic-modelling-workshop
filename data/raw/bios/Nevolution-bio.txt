Nevolution was formed in January 2004 by Gunnar & Heimir who shared the common dream of
success in the music business.
Not long after we formed the band we recorded a promotional cd, "the jumpstop
theory", which contains 5 songs. After few months of insane shows around Iceland we finally
got our first brake. We got the opening slot for Iron maiden’s show in Iceland 2005. Shortly
after that we released “Music to snap by” (2006) an album that got some recognition around
the European underground and got us gigs playing with bands such as Amon Amarth and Into
Eternity.
In 2007 we went to a hiatus for two years when Gunnar moved to the US. When he
got back we started playing again with a slightly changed line-up and began working on new
material, late in 2009 we shot a video for one of the new songs “All I see”

Since then we have been playing gigs every now and then but we are planning to
release an Ep. early 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/nEvoLution">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
