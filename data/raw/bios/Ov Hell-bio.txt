After their departure from legendary Norwegian Black Metal band Gorgoroth, bassist King ov Hell and vocalist Gaahl formed God Seed, with Teloch of 1349, Ice Dale of Enslaved (King ov Hell's bandmate in the short-lived I) and drummer Frost of Gorgoroth, 1349 and Satyricon. Gaahl then quit metal music after God Seed had played only two shows, leaving the band in limbo.

The band found a new vocalist in Dimmu Borgir and Fimbulwinter member Shagrath.

On February 8, 2010, Ov Hell released their debut "The Underworld Regime". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ov+Hell">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
