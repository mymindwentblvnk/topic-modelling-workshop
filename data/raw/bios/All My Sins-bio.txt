At least 2 bands are using this name:

1. All My Sins is a Black/Death Metal band from Pancevo, Serbia. Band was formed in 2000. They realised two demos: 2002 - Night Schlptures and 2004 - Form the Land of Shining Past. After the 2006 band has suffered a lot of member changes so it was impossible to play live and record new releases. Now, band is reformed again, with stable lineup. All My Sins are currently working on new material.
Current line-up: 
Vladimir Morar NAV - bass & vocals
Marko Telisman - guitar
Dejan Vitomirov - drums

All my sins is a groovy, old skool band with some heavy parts straight out of Ypres. If you're a fan of Madball, Skarhead, Blood for blood, Terror, ..., then you should check these guys out for sure. Finally, after having some line up changes, the band was formed in June 2006 and its members are Steve (ex-187, Rock stovrie) – vocals , Nick (ex-Retaliate) - guitar, Bert (ex-1outta6) - guitar, Geofnn (ex-Outcast) – bass and Siench (Ex-Retaliate, Crossed the line) - drums. A demo was made quickly and found its way to the Belgian underground scene. 1 year later they thought it was time to release a mcd. Some guys were a big fan from the beginning and they decided to start a brand new label, Days of war recordings, so they could release their mcd. Unfortunately, Geoffn decided to quit the band to focus on his family. A new bass player was found in likes of Meersie and with a mcd in their hands, AMS is ready to hit you hard.
