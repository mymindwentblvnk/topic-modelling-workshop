Chrodh Mara was 5 piece DIY metal band from Milwaukee WI. They make music to push the limits of their genre, and to spread a message of understanding, and tolerance shrouded in the ever popular metal/hardcore guise. The music is as powerful as you make it, and truly defines the parameters of the metal genreâ€™s art form. Chrodh Mara has played with such notable bands as The Ghost Inside, As Blood Runs Black, Terror, Salt the Wound, Dance Club Massacre, Blood Stands Still, The Analyst, and many more.
