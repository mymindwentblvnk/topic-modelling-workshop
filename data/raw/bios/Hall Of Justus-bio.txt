Founded in 2003 by Justus League member Big Dho, the Hall of Justus Music Group is a multi-media entertainment company that not only specializes in record distribution, but also music production and artist management. Although the label experienced success in 2003 with its debut single releases from L.E.G.A.C.Y. and The Away Team, a common misconception is that Hall of Justus is the de-facto label of the Justus League, and that members of the League aren’t permitted to seek deals elsewhere.

Dho started out as the road manger for Little Brother, but as their popularity increased they had no representation when it came down to handling the business side of things. Working with LB for a year Dho was able to bring his knowledge of the streets and life experiences into the fickle game of the industry. Before he took on the role as manger, he got his first taste of the industry through production. Even though he had other vision outside of LB, he states that "We all can't do music ... someone has to take care of the business". With so many artist being raped by the industry, the Hall of Justus is not only designed to put out quality music for the masses, but to school it’s artist the rules of the industry so that they can achieve full growth within their careers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hall+Of+Justus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
