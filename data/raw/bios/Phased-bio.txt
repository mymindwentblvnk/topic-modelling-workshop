Phased – 3 men, 3 instruments, 1 wall of sound. A collision of Sabbath-like heaviness and spacey Hawkwind riffage; the sunburned desert meets the blackness of doom. Distorted guitars and a droning bass clash upon tribal rhythms and melt into a maelstrom of sound Phased named “psychedelic deathrock”.

Founded in 1993, the band went through various line-up changes and one slight name-change: from Mercury 4°F (93-97) to Phased 4°F (98-01) and after all to the simpler Phased. Today, the band consists of the two founding-members Chris Sigdell on vocals and guitar, and Michael Greilinger on Bass, plus Marko Lehtinen on drums – a trio with members from Sweden, Switzerland and Finland. Maybe it is this mixture that is part responsible for their sheer mania? <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Phased">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
