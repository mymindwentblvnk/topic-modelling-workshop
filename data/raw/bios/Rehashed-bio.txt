Five jaded hardcore kids with no hope and no future come frantically screaming out of Saskatoon, SK with their latest effort called Rehashed. With a myriad of experience in the Saskatoon underground music scene under their belts (DFA, ex-The Decline, ex-Strike Force, Cashed, Poser Disposer), Rehashed combines elements of crossover, thrash, and hardcore, culminating in a no-nonsense approach to the execution of tight, fast, and extremely aggressive music.
