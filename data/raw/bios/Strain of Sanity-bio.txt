The year is 2006. Tom Anders Husø (vocals) a.k.a the Face or Tom Acid are trying to get a band together in Oslo after resurrecting from a band called Smother back in their home town Sandnessjøen. The year is less successful and in 2007 they move to Trondheim where they hook up with guitarist Alexander Aschehoug (now known as Ishkur or Sirup). After a couple of months Espen Andre Isaksen a.k.a Isak converts from guitar to bass and joins the band. They rent a practise space and start looking for a drummer. After firing the first drummer they meet Sander Svebakk. He is given a Heineken and blows everyone away.
Two minutes into the first jam he's hired.


Time goes by, the writing process accelerates and ideas and songs are coming along great. But after a couple of months the lack of money prevents Sander from coming to practice as he lives a couple of hours outside of town. And as they say in Guitar Hero "you aren’t a real band before you bring a drum machine to practice". Sad but true that's how the Sanity crew gets off for a couple of months, a little slower but at least foreward. But in june 2008 our man Magnus Hoff steps up and begins pounding them drums. The band are finaly a full band and now the hard work starts with writing songs, getting gigs and practising our asses off.

THIS is only the beginning of a booze pumpin', hard poundin', knuckle crushing monster and we won't lay our weapons to rest until... eh.. We're tired.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Strain+of+Sanity">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
