It was in 1992, when the Swiss Metal Band called EX-ORTATION was formed, followed by the release of the first Demo tape "Nightmare Of War" in 1994.
After various gigs, the Debut-Album "The Last Trial" was released 1995, distributed by SPV europe-wide. This offered the band a couple of intresting supporting shows for bands such as Death, Nevermore, Benediction, OverKill, Mortification and many more.
The following years then got quiet, while the band was exploring new musical grounds. One thing was clear, the name EX-ORTATION should not die!
As the second album "Contact" was released in 1999, it was obvious: This should only be the beginning of a new area.
One year later, in 2000, the release of the follow-up record "Orbit" was shaking the mountains of Switzerland. Maple Leaves Record (germany) was keeping an eye on the distribution of this longplayer.
While EX-ORTATION started to kick more and more butts live, the demand for the band was steadily growing.
Now we're back! With the new album "Bulletproof" at hand, the goals are clear:
- Distribution contract worldwide
- A supporting record company
- More shows with further great bands.
The first steps are already taken. The record is ready to press, and a first video clip is shot. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ex-Ortation">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
