Take a Daytrip, composed of Denzel Baptiste and David Biral, is a DJ/producer duo based in NY. Their roots are in hip-hop and NY nightlife, but their music pulls from a wide range of influences reflected in their eclectic group of collaborators.

Their tiny studio in Soho has become a hotbed for creativity and gateway for up-and-coming artists, producers, DJs, photographers, and creatives living in and passing through NY. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Take+A+Daytrip">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
