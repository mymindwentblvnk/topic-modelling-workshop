Colour The Atlas are four friends from Swindon, UK - Jess Hall (vocals), Alex Stone (guitar, vocals), Andy Vincent (Bass) and Stef Pysanczyn (Drums) - whose agile musicianship and complex songwriting belies their tender years; all are still in their teens.

Taking influences from Bon Iver, Angus & Julia Stone, Iron & Wine and Fleet Foxes and other artists who make sumptuous, deep, primarily acoustic music, at the core of Colour The Atlas is the songwriting and vocal partnership of Jess and Alex, who have an almost telepathic harmonic understanding.

In their previous incarnation as the Jess Hall Band the band received BBC Radio 1 support for their debut EP 'Play Shy,' which came out late last year. Colour The Atlas will release a new EP in late October 2012 on Ugly Truth Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Colour+The+Atlas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
