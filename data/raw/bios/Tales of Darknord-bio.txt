Tales of Darknord was a Russian brutal death metal band from Volgograd. It released multiple demos and four albums during its activity between 1991 and 2004. The band had a cult status in the Russian metal underground.

Two of ToD's albums were re-released by Firestorm Productions in 2015 with updated cover artwork and a few bonus tracks. That was the first time "The Last" (previously released only on cassette) got a release on CD. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TALES+OF+DARKNORD">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
