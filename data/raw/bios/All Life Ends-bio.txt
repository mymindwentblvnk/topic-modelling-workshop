Formed in 1998, All Life Ends combined the sounds of melodic European death metal and Bay Area thrash to establish a unique sound.  The band's peak came in early 2000, when it received praise from ex-At The Gates guitarist Alf Svensson for their single "Epileptic".  The band has been on hiatus since, with guitarist Jon Wells playing a key role in Shrine of Scars. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/All+Life+Ends">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
