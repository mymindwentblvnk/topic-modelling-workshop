Los Angeles born songbird and songwriter, India Shawn, has been lending her musical talents to the industry for over 9 years. Before releasing her debut EP, ORIGIN, in 2012, she already had writing credits and song placements under her belt as a member of her writing team, Full Circle. She’s worked with top names including Chris Brown, Diddy-Dirty Money, El Debarge, Keri Hilson, and Monica. In 2013, Solange Knowles featured India’s popular track, I’m Alive, on her Saint Heron compilation album, further endorsing her impact on the new wave of music.

With a smooth voice that connects to listeners immediately, lyrics that resonate with your heart, and fearless experimentation with R&B elements, India’s music has spiritual and emotional components to it. She continues to breathe fresh air into the industry with her and James Fauntleroy’s upcoming Outer Limits EP collaboration; set to be released in March 2015.

The essence of her music provides a spiritual/emotional connection with her listeners that is distinct and authentic while combining current and innovative elements. India Shawn’s songs take you back in time when music made you feel good inside. A musical experience that makes you think, touches your heart and motivates, some say, are the elements that are missing in today’s dynamic. India’s first solo project entitled “ORIGIN” can be expected to deliver awesomely good music that is relevant, transparent, and exciting.
