1. Pharao was a successful Dutch Eurodance act.
Their debut single, "I Show You Secrets", peaked at the top of the German Charts within weeks. European sales were so good that they made the Top Ten in several other countries, like Spain, Italy and Sweden.
The duo consisted of the exotic singer Kyra Pharao (who is half Indian) and the American rapper Deon Blue. The producers behind the project were Alexander Hawking and DJ Stevie Steve.

The singles "There Is A Star", "World of Magic" and the album "Pharao" (released in November 1994) also became huge successes.
In 1995 Deon Blue was replaced by American Eric Martin.

In 1997 after almost 2 years of silence the group was back, but the rapper Deon Blue had left the band. That year, two singles were released: "Temple Of Love" and "Once Upon A Time".
In 1998 appeared their second album called "The Return".
