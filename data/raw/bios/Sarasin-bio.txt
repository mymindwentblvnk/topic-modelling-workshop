Forged in the steel mills of Hamilton, Ontario, Sarasin has been satisfying the palate of the Hammer’s metalheads for more than 30 years. They recorded their first indie EP in the 1980s, long before other bands realized it was possible. Unlike the fame seeking poseur bands of that era, however, they did it simply for their fans — fans who are loyal to this day. Whether playing a dingy local bar or on the stage of a concert hall, Sarasin's throttle is always fully open. Unpretentious persistence has kept this band driving forward with their heads down simply doing what they love, smashing their fans in the face with hard-hitting, pulse-pounding metal. This most recent album was conceived when founding bass player Rob Grant fell ill and co-founding guitarist Greg Boileau wanted one last recording with him. Sadly, Rob never got to play on it and lost his battle in 2012. It took some time but Greg, along with longtime members drummer Roger Banks, and vocalist Mike Wilson pushed ahead to finish the CD and have dedicated it to their brother, Rob. In May 2015, the band signed a record deal with Germany's Pure Steel Records and the band’s goal for now is to promote the CD and resume playing shows in Canadian cities with the addition of veteran bassist, Les Wheeler. In summer 2016, they embarked on a tour of Europe (where metal is still flourishing). In 2018, Sarasin chose to raise the bar. Veteran vocalist Fabian Bortolotto entered the Sarasin family and the creation of the next CD Raise The Pain, began. In spring 2019, Sarasin gave the public a taste of their new creation and was met with an overwhelming response that led to a sold-out show at the Hamilton Place Studio Theatre. Sarasin is now what it wanted to always be: a driving force in metal music and continuing its legacy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sarasin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
