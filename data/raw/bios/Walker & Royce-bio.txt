New York City’s Sam Walker & Gavin Royce have been producing their emotive, subdued and groove-heavy house since 2011

Walker & Royce started when Sam and Gavin, having known each other in and out of the dance scene for years, finally began working together in 2011. Crosstown Rebels boss Damian Lazarus noticed one of their very first releases. The result was the Crosstown Rebels EP "You're Not Welcome" and with that, Walker & Royce was launched into the dance music spotlight.

Around the same time, Walker & Royce released a track on OFF Recordings that went on to become a house anthem: "Connected". The song became a mainstay in Solomun's performances and with that set the stage for a diverse range of sounds from the pair. Their EP on Moda Black entitled “Sister” was picked by Pete Tong as his Essential New Tune, and their chart toping remix of Baunz’ “Out the Window” on Pets Recordings garnered support from many of the biggest artists in electronic music. Most recently the duo has joined the ranks on Claude Vonstroke’s seminal Dirtybird Records with the release of the “Boy” EP and “Hit Dem Draws” and Green Velvet’s legendary Relief Records with their chart toping release “Peep This Cat”, and “3 4 Shake It” with fellow Dirtybird artist Will Clarke.

Having solidified their unique sound, you will hear Walker & Royce's music in many of the top DJ's from around the world! From Sasha to Adam Beyer, Maceo Plex to Gorgon City and Eats Everything to Locodice, they continue to break down the genre barriers and turn heads.... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Walker+&+Royce">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
