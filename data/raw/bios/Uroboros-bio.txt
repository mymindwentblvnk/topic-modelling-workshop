The name "Uroboros" can refer to two different musical projects:

1) Uroboros is a death/sludge metal band from Argentina, formed in 2012 by Ignacio Elías Rosner and Sebastian Ferreyra.

The duo started as a raw and heavily death-influenced sludge band, but through the years, they adopted a more personal and progressive style of music, incorporating elements from gothic rock, shoegaze, post-rock and avant-garde to their approach. 

Their debut LP "Deiphagomega" was critically acclaimed, being labeled as "state of the art metal music" by the specialized media. The follow-up, a mini-LP titled "धर्मपरिणाम", was also praised as a "rupturist" album, ranked among the best regional albums of 2016.

As of 2017, they have over 9 official releases and are currently about to release their second LP.

2) UROBOROS (ウロボロス) is a Japanese visual kei band, formed in 2015 by Kurose Keisuke (ex-Asriel).
