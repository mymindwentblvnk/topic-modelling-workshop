The Linda Lindas are a four piece punk band from California, USA. Two sisters, a cousin, and their close friend. The group comprises Bela Salazar, Eloise Wong, Lucia de la Garza, and Mila de la Garza.

In May 2021, the Los Angeles Public Library posted a video of the band playing "Racist, Sexist Boy" at a "TEENtastic Tuesdays" event. The song was about an experience Mila, the band's drummer, had when a schoolmate made a racist comment before the COVID-19 pandemic. The video became a viral social media hit against anti-Asian racism in the USA. Ten-year-old drummer Mila from The Linda Lindas told about "Racist, Sexist Boy", "A little while, before we went into lockdown, a boy in my class came up to me and said that his dad told him to stay away from Chinese people. After I told him I was Chinese, he backed away from me. Eloise and I wrote this song based on that experience." She further added, "We had the idea to write a song about that for a while. But when the presidential election came, we were like, 'Oh, this is the time for it.'"
The band's guitarist Lucia, commented on this track, "Of all the songs that we've written, it's the most hard hitting. It's very tough compared to what we usually write, and it had to be that way. If it wasn't that way, it probably wouldn't have had much of an impact."
On May 22, 2021, Epitaph Records announced that it had signed the Linda Lindas.
On July 21, 2021, the band released the single "Oh!" with an accompanying music video. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Linda+Lindas">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
