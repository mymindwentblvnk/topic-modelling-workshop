AYUTRICA was a doujin music circle formed in early 2008 whose music emphasized storytelling and a deep gothic feeling. They released three albums (Ende der Traeumerei, The Rose Garden of Nightmare and ベルンシュタインの王冠 -Die Krone von Bernstein- (Bernstein no Oukan -Die Krone von Bernstein-)) and five singles.

Its members were AYU (lyrics, scenario), tori (lyrics, illustrations) and Heidi (lyrics), as well as 星魚有香 (Yuka Hoshio) (vocals) and 【S】 (composition, arrange), both members of the doujin music unit Hearty Smile Factory.

As of September 17, 2012, AYUTRICA has disbanded, stating that the members are busy with their individual projects, but has not ruled out the possibility of getting together again. However, Yuka and 【S】have formed Eclipseed, which is in the same style as AYUTRICA and will be performing AYUTRICA songs at live performances.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/AYUTRICA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
