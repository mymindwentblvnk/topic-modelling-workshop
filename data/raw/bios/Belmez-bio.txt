One man black metal band from Germany. Formed by Karsten Breitung in 1993. The name of the band was inspired by a small Spanish town called BÃ©lmez de la Moraleda. This town became famous because of paranormal phenomena which allegedly occured in the 70's. The phenomena consist in strange images of faces which used to appear on the ground and on the walls of a modest family house in the town. The cause of the curious haunting has never been firmly established. One of those face images can be seen on the cover of Belmez's debut album "Berserker". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Belmez">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
