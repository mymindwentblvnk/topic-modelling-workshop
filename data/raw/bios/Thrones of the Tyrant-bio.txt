Melodic death metal band Thrones Of The Tyrant was formed by vocalist Tim Morris and rhythm guitarist James Blackenship after they left death metal band The Stagnant. Other members include Michael Mahurin, Ryan Meader, and Corey Boyles. With a sound that has been compared to The Black Dhalia Murder and Lamb of God, their lyrical themes focus on global and political issues ranging from anti-war messages to conspiracies. "Combined with their love of Death Metal and their common disgust of the elitist globalists and their agenda, Thrones Of The Tyrant was created to oppose the New World Order with their incendiary message." - http://www.reverbnation.com/thronesofthetyrant

They released a demo in 2012 with 3 tracks:
Democracy Bombs
Gatekeepers
Only The Ignorant Obey
