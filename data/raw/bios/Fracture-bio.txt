Fracture plays Metal with melodic composed vocals and lead melodies, on a bed of rough and hard edged accompaniment.

The band consists of five hard working and dedicated musicians, who’s only goal beside their passion for music, is to give their fans a 110% both live and on record.

Fracture released their highly acclaimed debut album "Dominate and Overload" late march 2010.

About 6) Welcome to the Frank Nitt and Sepalot revival! The Detroit MC (Frank’N Dank,
Dilla) and the Munich producer (Blumentopf) are Fracture. A new group with a
new sound and a new agenda. Nitt and Sepalot first hooked up on Sepalot’s
solo-album “Red Handed” (Compost Records). They went on tour together,
became friends and kept on recording – with no rules, no regulations and no
parking on the dancefloor. “Outrageous” is a 5 track EP that fuses Detroit
rap, Munich disco and Miami bass like no record before.

From northern Italy, this band released a 5 songs demo in June 2013.

On Nov 2014 a cover of At The Drive In's Arcarsenal has been released on the band bandcamp fracture666.bandcamp.com
