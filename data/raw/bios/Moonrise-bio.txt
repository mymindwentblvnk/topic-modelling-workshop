There are many projects named Moonrise.

1 - Brazilian shoegaze post-punk guitar-pop band Moonrise was formed in late 1993.
Their first demo, Woodland, is from 1994, by its original formation: Cesar Zanin (future member of Magic Crayon and other projects) playing the guitar and singing; Isabel Zanin playing bass; Claudio Louzada (ex-Femme Fatale) playing guitar; and Marco Costa (ex-Harry) playing the drums.

The second demo, from 1995, is called Victor. By then Marco had left the band, having been replaced by Paulo Gabrielleschi (ex-City Limits) programming the drum machine.

In 1996 Moonrise participated with two songs in the first Brazilian guitar-pop CD compilation project. The album is called Don't Be Afraid, My Son, and also features bands like Cigarettes, Sleepwalkers and Snooze. By then Paulo left the band and Carlos Cal replaced Claudio on the guitar. The drum Machine was then programmed by Cesar.

Out is the name of their third and last demo, from 1996. It's a compilation demo, with material from their three distinct incarnations: with acoustic drums, with drum machine, with no drums at all.

In 1997 Artifact recs released the split CD Old Moon Whale, with 6 songs of each of the following bands: Moonrise, Speed Whale, Old Magic Pallas.

Their last direct output as a band was the session that provided with their three songs on the CD Different Songs, released by Cesar's label O Bosque / Woodland in 1998 and featuring other Brazilian indie bands.

Moonrise had their songs released also by other labels, both from Brazil and other countries, Japan and UK among others.
Moonrise, besides frequent shows in many cities of the state of Sao Paulo, toured Brazil three times during the 1990's, playing in cities like Curitiba, Maringa, Rio de Janeiro, Goiania, Brasilia, Santos.
Moonrise had their songs broadcast in many radio stations from different parts of Brazil and extensive coverage among the pre-Internet Brazilian music written press.

The band disbanded in 1998, when Cesar started his project Walden.
Between 2000 and 2002 there were some one-off shows in Santos and Sao Paulo as a trio: Cesar (guitar/vocal), Isabel (bass) and Marco (acoustic drums).

In 2010 O Bosque / Woodland recs, now based in Brighton, UK, released the album Comping, a definitive collection of Moonrise's songs.

2- Moonrise was founded in 1994. Its first demo cd "no mean depression", produced in 1997, featured guest appearances from Nina Helbig and Peter Heppner.

The next demo "realize" (1999) already represented a significant step forward in the band's artistic development.

The following EP "cursed" (2002) featured four songs, three of which were presented on prominent samplers, including one from ASTAN magazine, one from Zillo Festival 2004 (where the band participated in a newcomer contest and played on the legendary Loreley stage) as well as "Goth Is What You Make It Vol. 5", Gothic Compilation Vol. 31 from the magazine by the same name, and "Extreme Traumfänger Vol. 5".

The year 2004 started very promising with an appearance at Zillo Festival. Moonrise participated in the newcomer contest at the open air festival.

The year 2006 started with a change in the band's lineup: Moonrise parted ways with guitarist Sir Steven Cordic und Drummer T. G. Replacements were found in De.Bow and Nik – and more than that: Both of them quickly provided valuable contributions to the Moonrise sound! After less than six months, the first appearance of the new lineup took place at Hamburg's well-known Logo club. Following the goose-bump gig at the Logo, Moonrise appeared at Club K17 in Berlin as support band for no one less than NFD in September. Meanwhile, the successor of "cursed", the EP "end of grace", was published in June after the sound had been fine-tuned together with Axel Ermes (Girls Under Glass) in his studio in Welle. First reactions to the five-track EP were euphoric. For example, the Internet radio station Mi-Amigo broadcast a one-hour Moonrise special with an interview and the tracks from "end of grace". The CD was also presented on Dunkle Welle and Toxic-Apple Radio.
