Currently making music in Seattle, Washington, Apoptosis knows music. A collector, wanderer, and sponge of all things rave, bass, and creative. 
Influenced by the mania of Venetian Snares, the party spirit of Drop The Lime, the bass of dubstep and breakcore, the disturbing beauty of Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, and Tool, and filled to the brim with respect for all of the above.
