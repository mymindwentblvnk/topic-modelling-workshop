There are mutliple artists with this name:


1) Seance is a death metal band from Linköping, Sweden. The band was formed in March 1990 with the fusion of two local Linköping bands Orchriste and Total Death, both which were formed in early 1987. They split up after two albums ("Fornever Laid To Rest" and "Saltrubbed Eyes") in 1998. Several reviews hailed "Saltrubbed Eyes" as one of, if not the most brutal death metal albums to date. Most band members were also involved in the bands Satanic Slaughter and Witchery. Patrick Jensen later joined the band The Haunted. 

The band reunited in early 2008 and recorded a new album called "Awakening of the Gods", which was released by Pulverised Records on January 19th, 2009.
