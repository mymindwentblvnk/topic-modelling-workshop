A veritable who's who duo of noise music that call Oakland California home. There is Gerritt Wittmer, who runs the Misanthropic Agenda label, has colaborated with Sunn 0))), John Wiese, and members of Yellow Swans, among others, and Ryan Jencks (aka SIXES) played in Crash Worship and has worked with folks from Total Shutdown and Comets on Fire. Together as Deathroes, they make a real bonfire of dream-killer music. When they perform they like to darken the room, then crank a fog machine up to "choke" and pummel the audience with a slow, irregular strobe light. Their drones are evil and vacant, poisoning any meditative feeling you might get, and when they explode into a creaky, grumbling sci-fi apocalypse, you feel the terror with your body as much as you hear it with your ears.
