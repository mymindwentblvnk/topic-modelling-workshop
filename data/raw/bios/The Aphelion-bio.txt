The Aphelion are a hard hitting progressive metal band from Ottawa, Ontario who have been active since 2015. They cut their teeth playing local shows, working out their image and sound on local Ottawa stages for three years before reaching their current lineup of Evan Haydon-Selkirk (lead vocals, bass guitar), James Cabral (guitar, keyboard), Tyler Davis (guitar, backing vocals), and Nathanael Livingstone (drums, percussion). They take influence from artists such as Devin Townsend, Haken, Leprous, and countless others. The Aphelionâ€™s lyrics focus on telling album-spanning stories inspired by philosophy and the human condition. Musically, the sonic goal is one of innovation, dramatic flair, and emotional gravity, with occasional unexpected shifts in genre to create contrast and bring levity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Aphelion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
