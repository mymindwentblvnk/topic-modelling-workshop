Cibelle is a mononym of Brazilian singer Cibelle Cavalli, (São Paulo, 1978)  who was five-years-old, in São Paulo, when they told their mother they wanted to start guitar lessons. Their mother agreed, and Cibelle moved around from instrument to instrument, trying their hand at the piano, percussion, and voice. As a teenager they were more interested in acting, appearing in commercials and promotional spots on MTV Brazil, but eventually realized that singing was their true passion and started performing at jam sessions around the city. It was at one of these sessions that they met Mitar Subotić (a then-unknown Yugoslavian DJ, Suba), who performed his version of synth-heavy samba for the crowd. Cibelle was intrigued by his interpretation of Brazilian music and, at a friend's urging, got up on-stage to sing with him. Suba was so impressed that he invited them to come to his home recording studio to work on an album, what would later become the seminal São Paulo Confessions. Though the producer died tragically shortly after the record's release, Cibelle continued on, appearing on guitarist and singer/songwriter Celso Fonseca's 2003 album, Natural, and releasing their own self-titled debut album on Six Degrees/Ziriguiboom. They followed up in 2004 with their EP About a Girl, and two years later Shine of Dried Electric Leaves, which featured duets with Seu Jorge and Devendra Banhart, came out.
