Herman (ex Castalia) also was part of the original line up, and then Alberto (December's Cold Winter.singer) joined the project. Finally, to complete the line up, Diego (ex Razas Ocultas) joined the band in late 2006, and then the band started to work on 100% original material. Later on in 2007 Allen Pinkay(ex December's Cold Winter) also joined the line up to include keys and programming. On late 2008, Nara left the band, and Norman Mena came in to take the drums on Adrenal. First album coming soon, we have already started working on pre production. The band's sound is very heavy and energetic, based on it's influences, fast beats and melodic riffs are part of our songs, with the addition of other secondary influences (metalcore, grindcore, progressive metal, etc). Adrenal's Debut Album is expected to be released this 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Adrenal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
