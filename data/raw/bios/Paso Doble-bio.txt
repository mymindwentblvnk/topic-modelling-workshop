Career

In 1979 Rale Oberpichler, a young singer who worked mainly as a background vocalist, wanted to go solo and was looking for a song writer met Frank Hieber, a Pianist, Keyboarder and composer who had worked with various groups and singers including Rio Reiser, Nena, DJ Bobo, and worked with Peter Schilling on his International Mega hit Major Tom (Coming Home).

Together they formed Paso Doble. In 1985 they released their first single Computerliebe, which was debuted on the TV show "Extratour" and hit #1 on the charts for several weeks. They also had a very well received appearance on Hitparade in March of 1985. The first album they released was Fantasie and the title track also spent several weeks at #1.

What would have been there second album, Versunkener Schatz, which they produced in 1986 was never released, although they did release 2 of the songs as singles Herz an Herz and Magische Nacht. It was eventually made available to the public via downloads on AOL, iTunes, and MusicLoad.

They decided to shift their work to more of a production and publishing side, while still releasing the occasional single and remix. In 1992 they formed the "Paso Doble Music Publishing House". For the sake of their daughter they have worked more at home in Eidelstedt.

Recently, having been off stage for a while, and according to Rale "Unsere Tochter ist jetzt in einem Alter, in dem sie es genießt, wenn wir mal weg sind" ("Our daughter now is at an age, at which she enjoys it, if we are at times away") and "Außerdem wollten wir einfach mal wieder auf einer Bühne stehen" ("in addition we wanted to simply stand again on a stage") they released a new 12" Message Angekommen in 2005. Their 2 most famous songs Computerliebe and Herz An Herz have recently been covered by Das Modul and Blümchen respectively.
