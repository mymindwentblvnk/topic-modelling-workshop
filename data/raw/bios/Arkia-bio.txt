Finland's Arkia combines a Black Metal atmosphere with Death Metal heaviness, as well as a light Grind influence to create something original, while still paying homage to their predecessors. Formed in 2008, this active group has already released two demos, Insektatio in March, and Katalyst in September.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arkia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
