Stille Volk ("The Silent People" in Dutch and German) is a French folk band from the Pyrenees area of France formed in 1994. The band draws inspiration from Celtic and medieval music adorned with modern elements using instruments from all origins and all ages: hurdy-gurdy, arabic lute, violin, bouzouki, bagpipes, chalemie, mandolin, portable organ, bombarde, various flutes, and other stringed instruments.

The band signed with Holy Records after the demo "Ode Aux Lointains Souverains" (1995) which was very successful, and released its first album "Hantaoma" in 1997: this CD offers an acoustic music of traditional and medieval influence whose concept is based on Pyrenean mythology (pantheon, spirits, legends etc)

The second album "Ex-uvies" came out in 1998 and presents an obscure music which is more electric while still keeping acoustic parts and some bewitching laments. The band apprehends paganism as an intuition or something surreal.

"Satyre Cornu" was released in June 2001 and rests on a very energic and medieval style, an orgiastic and mystic atmosphere punctuated with the language of 12th century troubadours revived but this most unusual music (it contains Occitan cover of Iron Maiden's To Tame A Land).

In June 2003, the fourth album was released, called "Maudat". According to the artistic tradition of the band, this is a conceptual album about a sorceress who travels into a phantasmatical universe full of myths, visions and legends. T

Maudat was released in 2003. Subsequent albums are Nueit De Sabbat (2009, Holy Records), PÃ¨ira Negra (2014, Holy Records), Milharis (2019, Prophecy Productions)  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stille+Volk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
