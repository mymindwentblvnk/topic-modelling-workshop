Seven Seals is an original and inventive UK band. A prog/pop car crash, this 'live' band have stayed loyal to their Lakeland home while snaking their way across the British Isles spreading a peerless noise. After a busy 2006 which saw the band release their well received debut 7" single 'Loose Ends' and pick up a host of prestigious support slots Seven Seals return in 2007 with their debut album  'Cells' . Serpentine guitar lines, sinuous bass, drums that kick like John Bonham while swinging like Buddy Rich and enough analogue synthesis to make Bob Moog blush. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seven+Seals">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
