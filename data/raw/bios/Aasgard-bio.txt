First time listeners of Aasgard will be able to draw an obvious contrast between them and Darkthrone.  But Aasgard is not simply a clone.  The music has an authentic sense of poignancy like a murderer plagued by a guilty need to kill.  The production is archaically robust and the bleating vocals further a sense of foreboding.  Essentially, listening to 'Nyx', is like hearing a reverse evolution, for this is music tethered to the rootstock of immorality in Black Metalâ€¦ Unrepentant, Christ mocking, warmongering, demon loving Black Metal fans of all maniacal shapes and heathenish sizes will definitely enjoy Aasgard! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aasgard">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
