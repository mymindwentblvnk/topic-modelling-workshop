"North Carolina's SEWER PUPPET was a late -'80s precursor to BUZZOV-EN; this is a vinyl press of their 1990 Frustrations demo. The band's sound mixes thrash-metal and mid-period BLACK FLAG - you know, like something that might've come out on San Francisco's Alchemy Records back in the day. I can hear similarities to VIRULENCE, MELVINS, early NEUROSIS in particular...SEWER PUPPET keeps the velocity under control over the course of these six lengthy tracks, never breaking a solid mid-tempo clip and slowing down for some extended proto-stoner-metal-style breaks. The pretty heavily muffled sound quality here will prevent this from blowing anyone's minds, but otherwise a pretty cool artifact for fans of the style. Sparse but otherwise decent packaging - the record cover reproduces the original cassettes art and lyrics - and limited to 350 copies."
