Formed in London UK in 2011 by guitarist/musician Shadow venger & vocalist/lyricist Cyclonis. 

The pair met whilst in school and have worked together on various projects for many years now. The purpose of this band is to finally release a whole bunch of tracks that were previously recorded but never released. 

The band have recently recruited a new, kick ass drummer and are currently on the look out for a rhythm guitarist to complete the live line-up of the band so they can get back out on the road and kick some ass.
