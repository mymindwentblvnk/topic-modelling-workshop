Downswitch emerged as a band in small town suburbia, Denmark, October 2006.

Creative freedom is very much key to the band - no rules, no boundaries – the first initial ideas are tweaked and adjusted, until it feels just right, or you can put it like:
“until it turns in to a beautiful butterfly wanting to kill everything in sight with its sensors blasting out lethal subtonic sounds making your brain bleed" 

Visuals are a natural part of Downswitch. This unfolds in the form of photos, videos and graphics. 
The music is the backbone, where categories, subgenres and other labels are not that important to Downswitch - as long as it sets off in metal! 

The lyrical universe circles around many issues: political - why is the world in the state it’s in, to more personal issues like why you wake up one morning looking for a reason not to slit your wrists. 

The core of the band has changed over the years, but it's still a growing unit. They already passed many milestones such as: Danish tours, European tours, release of the 2010 debut 'Let Clarity Descend From Blackened Skies' on the independent label Dutch Metal Records. 

In addition to this they've released three EP's; the latest from 2011 called 'Within The Light' is to be spread across Europe and the rest of the world. 
They've managed to make a few videos and have hours on end of video diaries from touring, rehearsing and recording. 
In 2009 Downswitch was among the nominated for best Danish Metal Talent of the year 2009. 

Through all of these experiences they've become wiser and stronger. They continue to work hard and invest copious amounts of time in the band.
