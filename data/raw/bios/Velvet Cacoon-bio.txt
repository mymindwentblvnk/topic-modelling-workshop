Velvet Cacoon was an American black metal/ambient band from Portland, Oregon formed in 2001. The band consists of two musicians, Josh (aka SGL) on guitar, vocals and drums and Angela (aka LVG) on guitar. The band is known for its particularly cold, melancholy and hypnotic brand of black metal, featuring quiet hissing vocals and repetitive, reverb-saturated guitar work.

Over the years the band has been surrounded by controversy for making a slew of false claims, including a string of fake albums and completely false band history. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Velvet+Cacoon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
