Formed in January of 2006, Severend is composed of members attending college in Lawrence, Kansas. All members, except for Nathan (who lives in Salina, KS) attended high school together, but their musical talents did not mix until they arrived at college. The bands sincere dedication to music drives the members to write a new chapter of metal and it consumes quite literally all aspects of their lives. Their melodic and sometimes tragic guitar riffs are infused with solid, cutting drums that, when combined with heartfelt vocals and lyrics, create the monster known as Severend. They hope that their music and performances will mean as much to their fans as it does to them. Severend is constantly writing new and better material and as of August 2007, the band unleashed five more brutal tracks onto the masses via their EP "A Deafening Silence" released Fall of 2007. THE EP WAS RECORDED BY CLIFF HACKLEMAN OF DICK VEIGN PRODUCTIONS!! CHECK EM OUT! As of October of 2007, The band parted ways with vocalist AJ and acquired new vocalist Mike Mcgloin. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Severend">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
