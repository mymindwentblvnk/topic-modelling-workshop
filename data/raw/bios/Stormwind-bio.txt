There are two bands by the name of Stormwind

1) The Belgium acoustic/indie/metal band, STORMWIND featuring ex-LIAR guitarist Matthias P. Halsberghe.

Heavy & rugged acoustic guitarsounds summon dark and moody atmospheres. Simply starting out as an impulsive Recording disorder. Ex-LIAR guitarist Matthias P. Halsberghe began writing & recording acoustic guitartracks on a beat-up crooked instrument on a beatup night in August. Multilayered, melancholic & driving fingerpicked guitars, stripped from all possible camouflage. Low-end basslines mixed with intense hooks and harmonized melodies
