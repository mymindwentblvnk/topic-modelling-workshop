Kill Robot Kill was formed out of the remains of three Carinthian, Austria underground bands in August 2010. The target was to tourn one´s back on the popular trend.
They met up in the practice room just to see what would evolve out of the different characters and tastes. Soon similarities were found. Then a live-set was build up
After the new formation in spring 2012 the band rocks the stages with the current six-headed line-up.

The music of Kill Robot Kill is stylistically hard to classify, there are mainly deathcore and hardcore influences visible which are often followed by spherical parts – concerning the vocals the whole spectrum is existing, the band doesn´t avoid alternation between guttural-screams-gangshouts -squeals and short and concisely clean hooklines which adds the certain something to their music.
Synthesizer, sample sounds and the abnormal song structures create a special sound experience for the audience.
