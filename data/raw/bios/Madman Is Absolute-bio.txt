Glasgow metal band Madman Is Absolute formed in April 2000. They combine thrash with math metal time signatures to create truly emotive and powerful metal.

Madman have supported the likes of The Haunted, Stampin Ground, Madball, As Friend Rust, Medulla Nocte, God Forbid, Devolved, Dead BlueSky, Charger, Creation Is Crucifixion, Tangaroa, Labrat and The Crown and their live performances, whilst energetic, are especially notable for the tight precision of the playing.
