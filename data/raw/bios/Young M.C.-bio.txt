Young M.C. (born Marvin Young, May 10, 1967) is a British-American hip-hop artist who was most popular for his 1989 hit "Bust a Move", which won him the 1990 Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance and helped to push rap music as a whole into the mainstream. His first album, 'Stone Cold Rhymin'', is generally seen as a brilliant pop rap album. It was released on Delicious Vinyl Records and re-issued by Rhino Records. After he left Delicious Vinyl Records, his career took a dive from which he never recovered.

He was born on May 10th, 1967 in London, England, but was raised in Queens, New York. After graduating from Hunter College High School in New York City, he moved to the opposite coast to attend the University of Southern California, where he earned his bachelor's degree in economics. His debt album found him working with seminal producers such as the Dust Brothers and earned him the #9 spot on the Billboard 200 top albums chart, with other singles "I Come Off" and "Principal's Office" also receiving considerable airplay.

As well as devising "Bust a Move", he also co-wrote the hits "Wild Thing" and "Funky Cold Medina" by Tone Loc. Young M.C. has also appeared in Taco Bell commercials and other occasional TV spots. For example, in 2006, Young M.C. returned to the spotlight by appearing on VH1's 'Celebrity Fit Club 3'. His iconic song, although saddling him with the label of being a 'one-hit-wonder', has been included in numerous multi-artist collections and has also been often covered by artists, notably including the Glee Cast. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Young+M.C.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
