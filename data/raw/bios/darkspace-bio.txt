Darkspace is an ambient black metal band from Bern, Switzerland, formed in 1999. The group is comprised of three members who call themselves Wroth, Zhaaral and Zorgh. Space-age names for an equally space-age project. True to its name, what Darkspace's music describes is the nothingness of space.

Their style is characterized by an ambient surrounding, hazy production and monotonic sounds,  which is somewhat uniquely melodic and variable. Mute guitar passages with blast-beats take turns with milder passages and sometimes even completely electronic passages, providing a fitting tribute to the cold, dark and void-like atmosphere which fills their work. Unlike most pure black metal bands, Darkspace at times employs rhythmic sections. This is evident in their first full-length-album, "Dark Space I".

Darkspace borrows a great deal of influence from electronic music, eerie, ambient synthlines which flow from the guitars. Passages with clear electronic clubkicks or total void-like ambience are incorporated into vocal samples (often from classic science-fiction films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Alien) alongside the unnaturally lyricless and very alien sounding screams.

Zharaal also has a solo project called Sun of the Blind, while Wroth has one called Paysage d'Hiver (under the pseudonym Wintherr).
