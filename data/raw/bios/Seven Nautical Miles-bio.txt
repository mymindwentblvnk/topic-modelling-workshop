Seven Nautical Miles is an ambient screamo / post-metal band from Piteå, Sweden, spawning from a thrash metal band Machinery of Suffering in 2005.

Citing post-rock, ambient, hardcore, and sludge as the primary influences, they create a sound similar in vein - but also very different - to bands such as Rosetta, Cult of Luna, and Isis, with their own unique take on it all. 2008 saw the release of their first album Every Ocean Reversed, mastered by Magnus Lindberg from Cult of Luna.

Seven Nautical Miles was formed in 2005 by guitarist Simon Wärja and drummer Johan Nordlund in the north of Sweden when the interest for their thrash metal band ended. They wanted to make something different, something with greater emotions than the past pig-kicking could evoke. After a few rehearsals their long time friends Mikael Holmberg and Robert Holmström which played guitar and bass showed their interest. Robert shared the same taste and visions, and Mikael felt like a natural step, since he and Johan had been partners in crime for a long time. SNM still needed a vocalist. Dag Falkman had made a good impression on the guys in SNM, playing in various hardcore / screamo acts, after one rehearsal Dag got the gig completing the symbiosis. Under the name Oceans Have No Memory they recorded a demo. The future looked good...

Only after a few shows Dag moved south leaving the band without a singer, but as a gentleman as Dag is, he introduced SNM to his friend Mathias Öystilä, singer in the great Luleå act Re Vera. SNM had seen Mathias playing with Re Vera so they knew he was perfect to replace Dag.

But still there was something missing... "How are we supposed to play all these melodies and riffs on only two guitars?", they said. "We need another guitarist! But who would that be?". Mathias knew the answer to that question: Henrik Nyström, who played guitar in Re Vera. Said and done, Henrik added his own touch to the songs with odd tunings and an energy on stage that was perfect in line with Seven Nautical Miles.

In 2007 record label Sound Devastation Records showed their interest in SNM, who still went under the name Oceans Have No Memory. After mailing back and forth it was agreed, SDR will release the debut album.

The band name had to go, but the band liked the idea of a name withholding water, but "Oceans Have No Memory" didn't feel right. Since it was about 13 kilometers (approximately seven nautical miles) to the rehearsal hall it was obvious that Seven Nautical Miles was the right name.

SNM recorded the album during the winter of 2007 and spring of 2008. The artwork was made by Pierre Johansson (artwork for Breach) and Magnus Lindberg (Cult of Luna) mastered the album.

September 22th, 2008, "Every Ocean Reversed" was released. SNM immediately went on a tour in Sweden to promote the debut album.
