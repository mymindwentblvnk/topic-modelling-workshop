If you recognise beats of The Wookie (aka Jason Chue) it's because he has been responsible for some of most well known and reused beats of the early 90's - from his days in the Soul II Soul soundsystem.

Having being  very quiet and relativley unknown since then, he re-emerged inside the UK Garage scene  as The Wookie (Chue - gettit ?) with a fresh unique sound, influenced by the 2-step rhythms of the day. 

His compositions remained special, having a slightly more polished sound than his peers.  With vocalist Lain, he enjoyed chart success with his piece Battle, despite dance music being firmly on the wane at the time in 2000.
