Over the last ten years, Bill has established himself as one of the finest working comedians in the country. From appearing on Conan O'Brien or Showtime at the Apollo, his style of comedy is able to connect with the audience.

Burr grew up in a large family outside of Boston, getting his first laughs imitating his lunatic father. Always putting laughter before his studies, Bill's dreams of pursuing any sort of respectable profession died in the sixth grade.

He now performs over three hundred shows annually, has two movies to be released in the up coming year, as well as a performance on David Letterman.
