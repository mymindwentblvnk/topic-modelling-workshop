Battlelore is a Tolkien-themed metal band that combines multiple metal subgenres.

It was founded in 1999 in Lappeenranta, Finland by Jyri Vahvanen and Miika Kokkola. Their first promo CD Warrior's Tale was released the same year. Though the release was taken pretty well, it is their second demo Dark Fantasy that caught the attention of Napalm Records's executives, thereby providing them with the future studio records and live gigs. Battlelore released six albums and went on an indefinite hiatus in 2011.

Their style takes elements from many different heavy metal subgenres, including melodic death metal, folk metal, power metal, gothic metal and symphonic metal. All of Battlelore's lyrics specifically revolve around characters and events from the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth.
