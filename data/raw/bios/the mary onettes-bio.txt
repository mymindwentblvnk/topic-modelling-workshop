The Mary Onettes are an indie rock band formed in the town of Jönköping, Sweden in 2000. The members are brothers Philip Ekström & Henrik Ekström plus Simon Fransson and Petter Agurén.

Inspired by guitar pop from the 80's and indie bands from the 90's, The Mary Onettes were successful in releasing one EP with Sony/BMG before being dropped. Their sound has been likened to Echo & The Bunnymen, The Church, The Smiths, The Cure and The Jesus and Mary Chain.

The band were then picked up by the Swedish indie, Labrador, where they released their debut EP Lost. Their 10-track debut album The Mary Onettes was released in 2007, followed by 2009's effort, Islands.

In 2010, the Ekström brothers started a side project entitled Det Vackra Livet who record in their native Swedish language. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Mary+Onettes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
