Hellish War is a brazilian heavy metal band, on road since 1995 and with two released albums: 

Defender of Metal (April/2001)
Heroes of Tomorrow (March/2008)

Although there has been a 7 year gap between their two releases (due to problems with their previous label), Hellish War has never stopped, and throughout all these years, the band had the opportunity to be the open-act for metal bands such as Saxon, U.D.O (Accept), Shaman, etc. 

In 2008, Hellish War finally has released their second album, Heroes of Tomorrow, which is being received by all headbangers and media with an amazing acceptance. Hellish War's traditional 80's heavy metal style remains untouched, although the new album's production provides a contemporary taste to their work as well. 

Hellish War's shows the same line up June/2001, which denotes the will from the band to make things happen and, more than ever, a powerful band on stage.
