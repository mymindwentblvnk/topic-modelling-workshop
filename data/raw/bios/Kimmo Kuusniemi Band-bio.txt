Kimmo Kuusniemi Band was the moniker used by Finland's first ever Heavy Metal band, Sarcofagus, to release the album "Moottorilinnut". The name was changed due to problems with their label, but after the release of this cult classic, they changed their name back to Sarcofagus.

Featuring three different vocalists, "Moottorilinnut" was the first Heavy Metal album to be sung entirely in Finnish and has since been remastered and re-released under Sarcofagus in 2004 as "Motorbirds".
