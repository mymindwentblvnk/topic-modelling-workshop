Hell's Sweat was formed in August 2004 in Kuopio, Finland. During the next couple of years we looked for a rehearsal place, wrote a bunch of songs and sweated like hell... In the beginning we played faster stuff but after a while slowed down a bit and started focusing more on grooving songs than fast ones. It was not a bad decision at all.

In late summer 2006 we decided to make a demo. We discovered this recording studio by the name of STUDIO 33. After some adjustments we finally entered the studio in October 2006.

Demo called REMAINS OF THE FOUR was made within a weekend. It was recorded, mixed, produced and mastered by this nice & talented fellow Tero Holopainen.
