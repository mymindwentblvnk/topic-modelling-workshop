Great Vast Forest was formed back in 1994 by Surgath (ex-Murder Rape) in Lages, one of the coldest cities of Santa Catarina, South of Brazil. The band is one of the pioneers of the new wave of Black Metal in the country. 

According to Surgath, Great Vast Forest's style can be best described as Barbarian Black Metal, as it's agressive and cold but also epic and melodic, a perfect balance between Black and Viking Metal.

The band has released its first demo, "Where the Warriors Ride...", in 1999. Soon this demo became a cult in the underground and GVF signed a contract for two albums with the Brazilian label Evil Horde Records (Azaghal, Averse Sefira, Murder Rape). 

The debut album, "Battletales and Songs Of Steel", came in 2002 with 10 songs and a beautiful artwork. Sometime after this release the band splited-up because of musical and political divergences between the members, since Great Vast Forest is infamous for being considered by many as a NSBM band.

After sometime on hold, GVF is back with a new line-up gathered by Surgath and is working on new material for the second full-length on Evil Horde. An EP entitled "Blood of Wolves" is recorded and will be released soon on GTV Rex.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Great+Vast+Forest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
