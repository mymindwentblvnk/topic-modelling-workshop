Addison Groove is the jukin' alter-ego of Headhunter (Antony Williams). Over the last 12 months he's become notorious for ripping through fierce sets of Chicago juke music; the mutant niche offspring of DJ Funk and Slugo's booty house designed to incite mind-blowing dance moves from liquid-hipped quicksteppers. He takes the 808-derived percussion of juke proper and reconstitutes the groove at a 'step compatible 136 bpm, contrasting the 808's booming potential with hi-pitched toms and rapid-fire samples to make the dancefloor go fucking spare.

Addison Groove has released 2 albums on the 50Weapons label, "Transistor Rhythm" (2012) and "Presents James Grieve" (2014).
