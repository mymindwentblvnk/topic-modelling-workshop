The story of this Kovin-Serbia based, thrash/groove band, actually starts with a story about two other Kovin based bands, Ambush and StrikeBack, because CounterIgnition was actually formed by joining these two bands into one. Both StrikeBack anda Ambush started back in 2001. and were disbanded in 2006. During this time, both bands played numerous shows across Serbia, Strikeback played at the "Timisoara UG fest" in Romania, and Ambush was invited to play at the "Gods of metal" in Italy, but they were unable to go to Italy due to visa problems. Both bands appeared on the "Forces of anger" compilation, and were just a step away from signing a record deal, but things didn't work out, and both bands were spontaneously shut down.... until the fall of 2006. when Aleksandar Krchulj (vocals, guitars, ex-StrikeBack), Mladen Kosovc (guitars, ex-Ambush) and Nikola Tubic (bass, ex-StrikeBack) decided not to give up on what they invested all their creativity and 5 years of their lives. The first step was to record a new demo, originally made just for the band members and closest friends, but somehow it did end up in public, but was never really promoted properly. In the year 2007. Aleksandar Maksem (drums, ex-Ambush, and later StrikeBack) joined the band, and it was the actual start, with proper rehearsals, and making new songs. Soon, Nikola left the band, due to not being able to commit to the band, and his place was filled by the StrikeBack guitarist, Goran Bozinovski. With this line up, the band played a few shows, and finally recorded a proper demo in the year 2008. Beside the new songs, CounteIgnitioN also kept the old songs, from the Ambush/StrikeBack period. Demo had great reviews from all around the world, especially England, where they became very popular on numerous radio stations such as “Reputation label” and “All stars of rock”. Shortly after the demo was recorded, Marko Djukanovic replaced Bozinovski on the bass, and the band played every major venue in Serbia, becoming the most active metal band in Serbia in the 2008/09. In the fall of 2009. the band went to studio to record their debut album “Spit or swallow” but soon after the album was recorded Maksem left the band after playing only several shows during 2010. On the other hand, publishing of the album was delayed until the june 2011, when the bend decides to go selfpublished. Meanwhile, Marko Matic joined the band on the drums, so the band becomes very active live again, playing festivals and group gigs, and getting ready for the tour to promote the album.
Since CounterIgnitioN picked up where StrikeBack and Ambush stopped, the music CountrIgnitioN plays is very much similar to what they did in StrikeBack and Ambush, it is thrash metal, combined with hardcore, metalcore, Serbian traditional music. The only new thing is more influence of progressive metal and jazz, that were proficiently inserted into the groove, aggression and energy that CounterIgnitioN inherited from its harbingers.
