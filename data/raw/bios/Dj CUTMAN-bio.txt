Late one night during a radioactive electrical storm in the skull-shaped lab of an evil scientist, an archive of old video games and music production software got mixed in with source code for antagonist robots. The accident overloaded countless robots, but one survived.

This robot was different. 

He had a new weapon. 
It was more powerful than Fire, 
stronger than Wood, 
and more dangerous than Snakes.

It was music, and he took it to the streets. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dj+CUTMAN">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
