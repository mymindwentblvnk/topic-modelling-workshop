SSSLOTHHH is an Atmospheric/Sludge metal band heavily influenced by Neurosis, Russian Circles, Mouth of The Architect, Cult of Luna and more into hardcore punk, sludge, and post metal without leaving the essence of post rock and black metal. Born in Bandung around early 2010, SSSLOTHHH contains Dinar (Drum), Vinsensius (Guitar/Vocals), and Syahroni (Bass). The name itself referred to Sloth as the animal, but they changed it to SSSLOTHHH to add gimmicks to it. Their lyrics are heavily issued around Sun, Earth, Life, and Human Kind.
