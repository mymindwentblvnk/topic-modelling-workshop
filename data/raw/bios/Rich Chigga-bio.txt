Brian Imanuel (born September 2, 1999), better known by his stage name Rich Chigga, is an Indonesian rapper and comedian from Jakarta, who is now based in Los Angeles. He is best known for his viral debut single "Dat $tick", which was released in March 2016.

Imanuel has collaborated with rappers such as Ghostface Killah, Young Thug, and XXXTentacion, as well as a collection of solo singles. He embarked on his first solo US tour in late 2017. 

After facing backlash for his provocative artist name ("chigga", a portmanteau of "nigga" and "Chinese", is a slang term for Asians who embrace hip hop culture), Brian announced in early 2018 on his Twitter account that he would be changing his artist name, first releasing the track See Me as simply "Brian", then adopting the moniker Rich Brian with the release of his d√©but, Amen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/RICH+CHIGGA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
