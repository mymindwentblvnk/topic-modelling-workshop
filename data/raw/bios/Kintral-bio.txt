The band was born after a proyect called In Limine, where Juan Quinteros (voice and guitar) used to played. It was based in lugubrious and ambient music sounds. Then Felipe Leighton (synthesizers) joined the band in 1998. At this time they became KINTRAL and then some demos were recorded. Because of the influences, black metal, metal in general and classical music, the sound was a symphonic and progressive black metal. At this point the band instinctively realized that the extreme music will be the pillar of its natural sound. And they would have to add something extra to capture clearly what they want to acomplish or express. KINTRAL recorded its first EP, Nocturna (2000) via indie, but it was never released. After some changes in the line up and many rehearsals, Andrés Olivares (bass) joined the band. With this current line up, they signed with Picoroco Record. After a short time, They entered at the studio to record its debut LP, Catrala (2002), which is based in the childhood of a controversial chilean character. After a constant evolution to something colder and violent (lyrics and music), in the year 2003, KINTRAL recorded the second album, "INTROVERSION from insane scenaries". It has more mechanical and heavy sounds that the previous CD, and it's not a symphonic black metal any more like at the beginning. Nowadays, the band has a stable line up, with its new drummer, Lucas Ledesma, who also participated in the first album. In the other hand, KINTRAL is promoting "INTROVERSION...", they already filmed a video for the song 'Inner Requiem', produced by Jean Pierre Cabañas, and a live video for the song 'An Inversion from Insane Scenaries'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kintral">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
