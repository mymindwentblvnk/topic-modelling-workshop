Pointless is the name of two bands

1) Pre-Turning Point short lived Hardcore Punk Band
Pointless started in 1986, as Skip and Jay were just getting into hardcore and wanted to start a band of their own. For a bunch of kids who were just learning their instruments, Pointless put out 2 demos worth of some great memorable hardcore. The first demo "Confusion" (with Skip on vocals) is raw, stripped down, angry hardcore with a healthy dose of an early '80s punk sound (bands like 7 Seconds and Circle Jerks come to mind). The song "Confusion" has a bit of a darker edge, and sounds like it wouldn't be out of place on some '80s LA punk compilation.

2) Started in 2003, they are an Acapella group comprised of students at Point Loma Nazarene University. They have recorded three cds "Just Feel It", "Channel 2" and "Keep It Fresh". While a legend on campus, the fame ends there as college students rarely have time to tour. Website <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pointless">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
