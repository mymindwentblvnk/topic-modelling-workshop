There are three bands named "The Heads":

1) The Heads (1993), based in Bristol, belong to the space-rock school of extreme psychedelic rock founded by Hawkwind, but they also absorb the dadaistic elements of the Flaming Lips. Debuting with Quad (Rooster, 1993), the Heads spent a few years releasing only singles. Relaxing With... (Cargo, 1996) collects the 1993-1995 singles (1994's epic 11-minute "Coogan's Bluff," 1995's "Television") and a few new tracks that show a much harder style - a demented soup of Stooges, MC5 and Blue Cheer. After the album, the band released the single "Gnu (Headhunter)" and the EPs Delwyn's Conkers (Man's Ruin, 1997) and Mao Tinnitus (Man's Ruin, 1998). The Time Is Now (Man's Ruin, 1998) collects the latest EPs.

Everybody Knows We Got Nowhere (Sweet Nothing, 2000)

The limited-edition Session 02 (Rocket, 2002) contains the 18-minute "Planet Suite No 3."

Under Sided (Sweet Nothing, 2003) contains the monumental Heavy Sea (half an hour).

At Last (Sweet Nothing, 2003) is a live-in-studio album that revisits some of the band's themes in a sort of improvised medley.

33 (Invada, 2005), released only in 33 copies on CDr + black & blue vinyl, collects rarities.

"In the early 90's, in a back street garage somewhere in Bristol, Simon, Hugo, Wayne and founding member Dave Spencer would jam for hours and then retire to Simons house for tea and a 'chat' until we could barely communicate. These were happy days and we really didn't give a fuck about anything other than getting in that garage, away from the scum outside, and turning those amps up to 11..." - MySpace


2)The Heads (1968) released Heads Up in 1968 on the Liberty Label (LST-7581). Members included Thomas Fraterrigo, Louis Buonome, Robert Fricalli, and Angelo Buonome. The Heads were produced by former Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers's Joe Negroni. 

Heads Up! is a forgotten classic of late sixties "head" music.



3) The Heads (1996) (Jerry Harrison, Tina Weymouth, and Chris Frantz) released the album No Talking Just Head in 1996.

The band's name refers to their earlier band, Talking Heads, whose lead singer David Byrne didn't approve and decided at the time not to record or tour with them.

Each song on the album was sung by different singers, including Johnette Napolitano, Debbie Harry, Michael Hutchence,Shaun Ryder and Maria McKee, plus others. Napolitano joined them as lead singer for a subsequent tour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Heads">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
