Shireen is a dutch formation existing since 2010. They make witchpop, a new musical genre that blends folk, pop and acoustic rock with electronic samples and beats: an energetic sound to carry vocalist Annicke Shireen's enthralling voice. Matriarch, their latest output, deals with themes of personal exploration, the strength of our emotions, femininity, divinity, our beauty and our crudeness, and asks what it is that makes us human, and what makes us more than that...
