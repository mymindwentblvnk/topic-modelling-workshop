Sadhara is Sanskrit for  "Inner Spiritual Worship" and is pronounced sa-DAR-ah.  It is an independent project, conceived and developed by singer/songwriter Katherine Burke.  Her music is a mix of European, Swedish and melodic death/black metal with female banshee screams and gothic clean singing.  Lyrically,  the subject matter ranges from the romantic and seductive to the dark and destructive, with a consistent poetic delivery.

For the 2003 (5-song) Demo,  Sadhara is Katherine Burke on lead and rhythm guitar, vocals, bass guitar and drum programming.

December 13, 2004:  Sadhara is currently developing a full length CD entitled  "To Hell, with Sympathy".   Iwan Hendrikx,  a drummer from The Netherlands, is contributing the drum tracks. Sound samples from their new album will be available soon.
