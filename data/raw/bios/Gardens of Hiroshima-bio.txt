Gardens of Hiroshima was formed in the year of 2005. in Zagreb, Croatia. Under the influence of melodic death metal and new school hardcore bands they started to make some music.

Recently they released their first EP entitled "Choose Your Side" which contains 8 tracks/6 songs. Recording engineer was their good friend Brankec from Usud and they recorded all songs in his band's garage. Mixing and mastering was all done by Ivan Jakic (Amok, Senata Fox, Ex-Nikad).
