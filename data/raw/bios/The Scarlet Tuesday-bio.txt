The Scarlet Tuesday were a indie / power-pop band.

Formed in Sheffield in 2005, this five-piece ensemble was something of a small-time supergroup, comprising members of various local bands. This generated a fertile creative tension as the band members were pulled in many different musical directions, but was soon to be their downfall. They split early in 2006.

They released few songs, through a split single with overlapping band Balor Knights and a compilation CD of various overlapping bands. Regulars at their energetic gigs bought a succession of remixed and remastered versions of these songs on CD-R. They are all out there, somewhere. And their legacy is yet to be known.
