Laughing in the face of existential horror and spitting in the face of red-blooded American hypocrisy; Total Massacre plays every song with a sense of urgency and dread as if at any second some lunatic in the White House might unleash nuclear annihilation upon us all. This LA based 4-piece channels the breakneck pace and buzzsaw guitars of '80s hardcore with lyrics drenched in the sweat, tears, and disaffected rage of life in the year 2017. Explicitly political and anti-fascist vocals bark an outraged retort to both the ineffectual, self-defeating cynicism of neoliberal centrists, and the greedy, craven nihilism of modern-day conservatives. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Total+Massacre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
