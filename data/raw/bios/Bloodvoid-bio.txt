bloodVoid is a Houston-based, metal act looking to breathe life back into the Houston Metal Scene. bloodVoid was formed in early 2005 from members of Sacred Soul, and soon to be joined by Mike Marksberry and Shane Hamrick from Houstonâ€™s own HEADDRUG. bloodVoid quickly began gathering a fan base with its brutal double bass and heavy, groove-oriented guitar riffs. In doing so, bloodVoid sold the most tickets at the past September's Texas Metalfest. bloodVoid received the best slot on the bill and followed-up the sales with a brutal performance. Shortly after Metalfest... Chris Smith, former frontman of the short-lived, experimental metal project THE GHOST LIMB THERAPY, took over on lead vocals. Long time friend/bassist Adam Rabel joined the band a few months later and bloodVoid was reborn. Blended with the battering riffery of Mike Palacios and Chris McDaniel on guitar, and along with Mike Marksberry's blistering drumming, both Smith and Rabel fit like a glove. Rabel's brutal bass rhythms with Smith's bipolar screams and melodic prowess, have given rebirth to an already menacing metal ensemble. Members of bloodVoid have shared the stage with bands such as: Sworn Enemy, Fleshgrind, Skinnless, Obituary, Full Blown Chaos, Alabama Thunderpussy, Hemlock, A Dozen Furies, Brujeria and countless unsigned acts from across the US.
