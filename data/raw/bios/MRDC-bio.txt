Martin Richmond is a successful independent composer, sound designer and music producer with an impressive array of radio, television and film credits that recently include, the CBS weekly series “Ghost Whisperer”, MTV's "Date my Mom & Making the Band," Global TV's "The Telus World Ski and Snowboard Festival", Beyond the Action ,and a number of television commercials. Martin is equally at home on keyboards, guitar or bass. He’s an exceptional rhythm programmer, sound engineer and re-mixer. An early gig with the Record Plant's Gordon Fordyce (Motley Crue, Van Halen, Ozzy, P'Diddy, Tone Loc, TLC and Seal) helped Richmond to cement his own distinctive sound that blends diverse musical soundscapes to create a memorable mood for any story or livingroom. Martin likens his intuitive music-making process to an electronic canvas, saying "anyone can throw paint on the wall and call it art, but a true artist instinctively chooses the best colors, shapes and textures... "I don't follow formulas and yet my music works because I know how to blend all the right grooves." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MRDC">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
