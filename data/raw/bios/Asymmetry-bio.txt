There are several acts using the name Asymmetry:

1. The beginning of existence of Asymmetry is the moment when the oldest of Kotovski brothers, Andrew decided to play bass again in the end of summer 2008. (Earlier a bassist of heavy-metal band Membrana). At that time two brothers decided to form a band of absolutely another level. They invited a drummer Alex (ex-Orion) and started to rehearse. Having had enough material they started to write their own songs, which became a symbiosis of modern metal, prog metal, math metal, groove metal, djent and jazz elements. Influences: Sikth, Opeth, Meshuggah, Tesseract, FellSilent, Protest The Hero, Lamb of God, Dream Theater, Textures, Metallica, LTE, Porcupine Tree, Karnivool, Periphery, Pain of Salvation, etcâ€¦

2. An international black metal collaboration between Sandess (Roman Cross) and Luxixul Sumering Auter (Aura Saturnal, Cosmic Church). This has resulted in 2 demos thus far. Lyrical themes include Occultism and Magic. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Asymmetry">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
