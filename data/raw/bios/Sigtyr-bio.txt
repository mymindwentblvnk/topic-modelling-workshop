Sigtyr is the continuation of Odne's one man-project, that he found in 1999. Mordvarg joined in 2002. Mordvarg was playing in the local death-metal band in Vik called "Malicious Beauty" at the time. Odne worked on his own solo-project since 1999 playing a form of black/folk/viking metal. "Malicious Beauty" recorded a few demos since 1998 and Odne recorded a demo called "All Makt" in 2000.

Sigtyr had a few recordings in 2002 and 2003, but their first full length demo was recorded in 2004, named "Sjelefred."
After their next demo "Kulde" in april 2005, Sigtyr became a full band as members from the band  Mistur came along.
Espen Bakketeig on synth and additional vocals and André Raunehaug on lead-guitars and additional vocals, included Oddbjørn on drums.
