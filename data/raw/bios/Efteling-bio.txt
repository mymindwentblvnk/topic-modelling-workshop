Efteling is a well-known themepark in the Netherlands, themed around fairy tales. Efteling Naturepark started in 1952 with the (still popular) Sprookjesbos (Fairy Tale Forest). Since the late seventies, many rides have been added, most of which have some relation to fairy tales.

Music from Efteling attractions is of great variety. Most popular are pieces composed by Ruud Bos, including Fata Morgana, Villa Volta and Dreamflight. There are 2 other composers of the Efteling music.
René Merkelbach wrote music for George and the Dragon, the new roller coaster which opened in the summer of 2010. Also well-known music of Merkelbach is the other roller coaster; the Flying Dutchman. 
Maarten Hartveldt wrote music to get a nice atmosphere in the Efteling. During your walk through the park you may hear his music coming out of the bushes. 

However, several well-known songs or pieces of music composed by other people are used as well. For example, Afrikaan Beat by Bert Kaempfert is used at the Indian Water Lillies and an excerpt of Dance Macabre by Camille Saint-Saëns is used as background music in the Haunted House. 
Also music from Beethoven and Bach are to be heard in the park. In the fairytale forest you'll here the 'minuet in G' of Bach coming out of several, in the park scattered, mushrooms.
