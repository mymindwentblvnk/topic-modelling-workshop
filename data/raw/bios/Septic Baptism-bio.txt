Septic Baptism was formed in the summer of 2007 in Layton, Utah, recorded a shitty demo from inside a garage (these songs were never released), recorded another demo with a different style of music from the first demo, played about 3 shows, started to write more songs then ceased to exist by the end of summer 2008.
