3FORCE is a young and unique electronic trio based in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. The band began its history in late 2014 after drum 'n bass artist Gancher & Ruin met with talented ambient musician Eyescream. It all started with the mix of retrowave and synthwave, but also aggressive electro they came up with in their first 'Intergalacticâ€™ album in 2015. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/3+Force">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
