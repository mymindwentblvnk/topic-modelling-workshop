Hailing from a small town in Alberta, Canada lies a unique melodic power / death metal band called Crimson Scythe. Formed of only 2 young metal fanatics, this duo rose out of the ashes of a melodic power metal band called Heretic (Instrumental). Spreading metal to the masses like wildfire, Dennis Miller and Lord Beck come together in a style of metal heard in early Children of Bodom albums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crimson+Scythe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
