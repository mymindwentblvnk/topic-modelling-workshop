With band members that hail from as far afield as Bulgaria and Finland, indie-pop four-piece Hayes & Y harbour a somewhat continental feel that immediately sets them apart from their quintessentially British contemporaries.
Having moved to the UK just a couple of years ago, the four-piece have assimilated quickly, becoming a part of their new country’s scene and taking shows at some of the Britain’s best-loved venues in their stride, including the likes of London’s Dublin Castle, and Manchester’s iconic Night & Day Cafe, as well as a notable slot on the Spirit of Burgas festival in Bulgaria supporting Kasabian. Their 2017 single “Always So Simple, Always So Cold” received strong support from BBC Introducing in Manchester and reached 13th spot in Spotify Top 50 UK Viral chart. In the autumns of 2018, Clash Magazine praised the band’s single “BLUE” calling it “an immediate, addictive track that also manages to retain its subtlety, a moody dancefloor burner with a killer chorus”.
Live shows mean nothing without the music to back it up however. Fortunately, Hayes & Y exhibit a strong chemistry and rich musicality that are manifest in their effortlessly sleek brand of pop. Taking their cues from ‘80s electronica as much as they do from contemporary indie, the four-piece have successfully crafted an aesthetic that feels both timely and timeless.
