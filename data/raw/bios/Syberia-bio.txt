There are a couple of bands/projects called Syberia.
1.
Syberia is a Post-Metal/Instrumental from Spain. Have released 3 albums "Drawing A Future" in 2012, "Resiliancy" in 2016, and "Seeds of Change" in 2019.

2.
Syberia is a highly acclaimed 2002 computer adventure game made by Benoît Sokal, developed by Microïds and published through The Adventure Company.

Soundtrack was written by Nick Varley and Dimitri Bodiansky, who has also written soundtracks for other classic adventures, such as Outcast, Amerzone, Twinsen's Odyssey and Fade to Black.

It was never released on a separate CD, so most files are tagged with "Syberia" instead of names of real artists.
3.
Syberia is also a hc/punk band from Zabrze, Silesia, Poland. They formed in late 2007 and recorded a demo EP called 'Imago Mortis'. In the beginning of 2008 Iakvb gave up leadsinging and Szymon joined the band.  In September 2008 Syberia recorded their second EP "Zabroncie oddychac".
Musically Syberia is mixing the sound of post-punk, cold wave and fast oldschool hardcore.
