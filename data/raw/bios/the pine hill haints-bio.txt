The Pine Hill Haints are an American traditional bluegrass/folk/honky tonk/country band from Alabama, though the band members themselves describe their unique southern roots music as "Alabama Ghost Music."
The Haints are composed of Jamie Barrier on guitar and vocals, Katie "Kat" Barrier on mandolin, singing saw, and washboard, Stevie LaBlanc on washtub bass, Justin Ward on accordion and trombone, and Brian "Zero" Borden on snare drum. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Pine+Hill+Haints">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
