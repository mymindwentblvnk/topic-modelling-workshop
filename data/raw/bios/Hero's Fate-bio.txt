Heroâ€™s Fate was founded in early 2009. After a short time they released their first demo-ep "Avenging The Lost". WIth every band rehearsal the band grew a lot: they got faster, harder, more aggresive, but still melodic. Then they released their second ep "Among Red Leaves", which can be downloaded legally! 
In August 2012 they released their debut album "Human Tides: Black Light Inception". They followed up the first "Human Tides" album with "Human Tides: Cosmos Ex Chaos" in May 2015.
