Conrad Ignatius Mario Maximilian Sewell (born 31 March 1988) is an Australian-born singer and songwriter from Brisbane, Australia that attended St Laurence's College from 1998-2005. Sewell is best known for his vocals on Kygo's single "Firestone" and his number one hit single "Start Again". 

Growing up in Brisbane, Sewell started pursuing a music career from a young age, sending around demos since he was 8 years old. Sewell is the brother of singer-songwriter Grace, who is best known for her 2015 cover of "You Don't Own Me".

Several people have been a part of creating the new music including Jamie Hartman (Christina Aguilera, Joss Stone), Sam Hollander (Train, One Direction), and Eric Rosse (Sara Bareilles, Gavin DeGraw).
