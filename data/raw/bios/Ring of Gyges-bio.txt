Reykjavík, Iceland

Although Ring of Gyges are heavily inspired by the progressive rock bands of the 70’s, their sound is much more metal- oriented and draws influences from progressive bands of the modern age. They strive to create epic and grandiose music with unconventional song structures and vast soundscapes, often accompanied by philosophical lyrics.
