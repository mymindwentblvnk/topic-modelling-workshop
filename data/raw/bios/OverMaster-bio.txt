Overmaster is an Italian Melodic Power Metal / Heavy Metal band formed in 2006 in Alessandria, Piedmont.
Their style is much of a traditional guitar-driven Power / Heavy Metal. 
It's forceful Power Metal inspired by f.e Judas Priest's Painkiller era, early Vicious Rumors or German bands like Grave Digger. To this they add a mildly symphonic element, their keyboard player Alexandros.
Overmaster performs lots of mute picking storms and melodic escalation.
