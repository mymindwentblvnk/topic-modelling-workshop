Irukandji can refer to four bands:

1. Irukandji is a Melodic Death Metal band from Ford City, PA.  Their official band page is https://www.facebook.com/irukandjiofficial

2. Irukandji is a female fronted progressive metal/hard rock band from Norwich, England formed in 2007 under the name Strength of Presence, (initially as a semi-acoustic trio of two guitars and lead female vocals). In 2008 they recruited a drummer and a bassist and changed their name to Irukandji, to reflect the harsher more aggressive nature of their music. Their style is heavily based on singable melodies, fast paced technical guitar solos and double-bass pedal drumming. Their lyrics are often dark and based on various mythologies (vampires, river Styx, etc). Their current band page is www.myspace.com/irukandji. On LastFm they can be found under Irukandji SP.

3. Irukandji is a progressive psytrance project from Sao Paulo, Brazil by Lucas Duarte, who has been involved with music for several years and who began his career with the full-on project Processor, which he is still developing. Irukandji intends to rescue the old way of making progressive psytrance with tough basslines and melodies, and adding to it organic and new age elements. The low beat from Irukandji can be appreciated whether you are at the dance floor, or anywhere else. 

4. Irukandji is a harsh noise side project of Michael Page (Fire In The Head/Sky Burial). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Irukandji">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
