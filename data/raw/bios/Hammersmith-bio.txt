There are TWO bands by that name:

*****************************************************************************************************************

The heavy rock group Hammersmith formed in the early '70s, members coming together from the death of other groups like Painter and Shades of Blond. Hammersmith's lineup included lead singer Dorn Beattie, bassist Royden Morice, guitarist Dan Lowe, drummer Bob Ego, and a confusing mixture of other artists, who might or might not have been official members. 

Hammersmith recorded its self-titled debut album in 1974 and released it under the Mercury Records label. Two years later there was a sophomore recording, It's for You. That second album was the last for Hammersmith as in 1977 the band lost its contract with Mercury. The loss proved to be a catastrophic blow for the gathering. After the formal disbanding, most of the members stayed in the music world, simply moving on to other groups. 

Some of the tunes by the group are "Under the Sea," "Be a Star," "When I Was Young," "Dancin' Fools," and "Hello, It's for You." ~ Charlotte Dillon, All Music Guide
