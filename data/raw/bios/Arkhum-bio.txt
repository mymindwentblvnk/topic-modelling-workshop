Formed in 2006, the band released their debut album 'Anno Universum' in 2010 on Vendlus Records and their sophomore follow up 'Earthling' in January of 2013. While their first two albums were heavily influenced by more technical death metal bands, a genre shift began in 2015 when they adopted more of a black metal tone.
