Matthew Robert Cooper is widely known as Eluvium and less known to be a part of Concert Silence. His music (typically categorized as 'ambient', though somewhat cinematic) is mostly guitar or piano-based.

His first album under his own name is released by Gaarden Records and is called "Miniatures". Nine short saturnine interludes make up the first proper vinyl release by the sound artist who has intrigued your collapsed antenna many times before as Eluvium, Matthew Robert Cooper. Atmospheric chamber music from the cardboard box vortex. Miniatures moves from swirling spatial feedback manipulations to stripped down minimal piano pieces and back while you watch from the curbside the ghostly parade. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Matthew+Robert+Cooper">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
