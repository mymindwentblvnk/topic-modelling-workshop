Sweden, Sandviken (2011 â€“ present)
Blazon Stone is the side project of Cederick Forsberg, a Swedish multi-instrumentalist who also plays in The Storyteller and has other studio projects such as Rocka Rollas, Breitenhold, Mortyr, Cloven Altar and Lector.

According to Cederick, he started Blazon Stone because he loves Running Wild so much that he wanted to write music in that exact same style, more precisely in the German band's "pirate metal" era from the 90's.
The first two albums had different singers, but from the third album Erik Forsberg became the project's permanent vocalist.
