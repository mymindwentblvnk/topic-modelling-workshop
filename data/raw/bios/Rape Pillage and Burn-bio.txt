Rape Pillage & Burn is exactly thatâ€¦The meaning of the words! Violate, Attack, and Destroy the listener with audible Hell! In this day and age of safe metal Rape Pillage & Burn will exist to provoke and scorn the timid! Rape Pillage & Burn proudly plays Raw, Aggressive, Brutal, Combative, and Extreme music...The way Death metal is supposed to be! Look out for the debut e.p. and album out 2008/2009 on Ibex Moon Records.
