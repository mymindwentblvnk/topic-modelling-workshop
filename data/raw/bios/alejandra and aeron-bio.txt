Alejandra and Aeron are Alejandra Salinas (Spanish, born La Rioja 1977) and Aeron Bergman, (American, born Detroit 1971), artists based in Barcelona, Spain. In 2002 the duo won an Award of Distinction in Digital Music for their audio installation "Revisionland" from the Prix Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria. They have released 12 critically acclaimed full length audio CDs on labels such as Orthlorng Musork, Fat Cat, Tomlab and Lucky Kitchen. Their early audio works are among the first experiments in folk and electronic music. This is especially noted in "Ruinas Encantadas" (Lucky Kitchen 2000. Winner of an honorary mention in Prix Ars Electronica 2001) and "Porto: Folklore Fragments Volume 2" (Lucky Kitchen 2005).

Alejandra and Aeron's audio works are genre crossing projects based on the documentary and electro acoustic traditions using a subtle design aesthetic. "Folktronic" musician Momus recently wrote about their "Porto, Folklore Fragments Volume Two" CD in Wired magazine comparing the artists to John Cage and Brian Eno because the artists blur borders, using "Cagean" framing strategies.
