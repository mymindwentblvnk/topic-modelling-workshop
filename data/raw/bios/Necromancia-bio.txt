There are several artists called "Necromancia"

1. NECROMANCIA was founded in 1984 by the D’CASTRO brothers; MARCELO (vocals and guitar), KIKO (drums), with bassist EDGAR “BUDEGA” GERBELLI completing the trio. In the early days the ultra-speed-thrash-oriented band was rather influenced by the work of artists such as Venom, Slayer and Voivod. In 1987 they contributed two tracks to a compilation called HEADTHRASHERS LIVE. The line-up had changed and ROBERTO FORNERO had replaced BUDEGA on bass. Time flies, and in 1993 they recorded the single HYPNOTIC. 

In 1997, they released their first album, on which the influences ranged from Iron Maiden to Black Sabbath and Motohead. In 2004 arrives CHECK MATE, the second album. Yes, it’s thrash- influenced - think Sepultura, Slayer, Voivod and Machine Head - but NECROMANCIA have developed a personal approach, combining brute power and breakneck speed with complex arrangements and melody. CHECK MATE was produced by Andreas Kisser of Sepultura, who also contributes a guitar solo and backing vocals on the track: GREED UP TO KILL. Another guest is Alex Camargo of Krisiun, who lends his vocal talents on THE BLOODING. Additionally the album contains two bonus tracks. The Motorhead song: OVERKILL and a video track of GREED UP TO KILL. 
Voice Music has released in January 2008 the first album “NECROMANCIA” (NECROMANCIA) remastered and with all their previous material as bonus track 7’ EP “Hypnotic” (1992), “Suicidal Madness” (demo 88), Headthrashes Live (compilation 1987) and a version of “Dead Embryonic Cells” from Sepultura. NECROMANCIA is now working on the new album: "Back from the dead", to be released this year. 

2. Necromancia was founded in 1991 as a Death Metal band. Their first Demo was released in 1993, "Garden of Delight" and it featured a dark, industrial atmosphere. "Garden of Delight" is the only material produced by the band under this name as in 1995 when they released a new demo entitled Nihil Negativum it was released under the "Anorexia Nervosa the Nihilistic Orchestra" name. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necromancia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
