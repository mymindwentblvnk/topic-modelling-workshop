At the beginning of the year 2004 Vasyl (guitars, vocals), Hubass (bass) and Anton (drums) decided to join forces and start project named Morion. Later that year Morion enlisted Misterius (keyboards) to complete the unique style of the band. Live debut took place at IV Poznan Dark Festival, since then Morion shared stage with bands like Moonlight, Strommoussheld, Sacriversum, Artrosis and Lebenssteuer. June 2005 was marked with recordings of debut demo "Symbol Of Time" - the recordings took place at Migdal Mobile Studio. Year 2006 results in line-up changes - teppah steps in for Hubass and Gwiazda (guitars) joins the fold. Later that year Morion enters Migdal Mobile Studio to record "Insomnia" album, scheduled for mid-December 2007 release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
