Magic Trick is an indie rock band from San Francisco, CA, United States. It is the backing band of The Fresh & Onlys frontman Tim Cohen. 

The first album Cohen released as Magic Trick, The Glad Birth Of Love (2011), was essentially a Tim Cohen solo album. The backing band he formed for his live shows morphed into a proper band, so that the second Magic Trick album, Ruler Of The Night (2012), is very much a band album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Magic+Trick">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
