Decayer is a 5 piece deathcore outfit from Tucson, AZ. Formed in late 2016 by vocalist Harrison Burkardt and guitarist David Scordato, Decayer set out to bring a fresh take on deathcore and metalcore to the heavy music listener. After bringing Keith Huffman on bass, Taylor Bayless on drums, and Devon Marr on guitar, Decayer has since released two EPs and a full length album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Decayer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
