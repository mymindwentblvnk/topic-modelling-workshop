Gutworm are a band from Wellingborough,  Northamptonshire. Whether the postcard-friendly villages of thatched roofs and cheeky ale-supping posties or the faceless prefab towns of Burberry, unemployment and alcoholism, they’re united in their oppressive sense of just how futile hope of something different really is. 

Gutworm gave up on that long ago and set about the metal underground the old school tenacity of their spiritual forefathers, taking their polished, contemporary blasts of riff-laden death/grind fury onto stages with Morbid Angel, Nile, The Haunted and Testament, as well as hitting the extreme metal festival circuit in the US – mostly before even having been looked at by anything as crass as a record label. 

After flirting with major league metal label SPV, they reached an accord with Anticulture to release their debut full-length, the critically acclaimed ‘Ruin The Memory’. Four years later and it’s time for a fresh blasphemy in the form of ‘Disfigured Narcissus’, recorded by Greg Chandler of Northern doomsters Esoteric and mastered by Russ Russell whose previous studio credits include Dimmu Borgir and Napalm Death.

Rare is the band who live up to the ethos upon which the scene was founded and rarer still is the band who manage all that whilst kicking in the teeth of their listeners with a power unmatched.
