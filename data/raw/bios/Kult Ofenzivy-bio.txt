Kult Ofenzivy means "Cult of the Offensive" ("offensive" as in the noun meaning "an organized and forceful campaign to achieve something") in Czech.

Some session members are also in Sator Marte, Dirris and Valraukar, but the main person and former behind Kult Ofenzivy isn't a member of any other bands.

The members also have a new band Triumph, Genus.
