Mind Over Four (occasionally written as Mind Over 4) was an American heavy metal music group based out of Los Angeles, California. Their quirky style made them difficult to pin down or categorize, but could best be described as a combination of alternative metal with influences from punk rock and the classic hard rock of bands such as Led Zeppelin and Mot√∂rhead.

The band dissolved shortly after the release of their 1995 album, Empty Hands.
