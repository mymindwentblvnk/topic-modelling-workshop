[1] 
Edifice is Electroacoustic musician Eric Hall who hails from Indianapolis, Indiana. Edifice releases with Karakasa Music, who have put out his debut "Birth of a Mountain EP"  on April 22, 2011.
Brick by brick we construct this edifice, only to have it taken away by that thief we call time.
Edifice brings elements of progressive and experimental rock into a mainstream-friendly collection of driving staccato rhythms, touch-style guitar playing, bittersweet melodies and thought-provoking lyrics.

The atmospheric one-woman project of the Ukrainian composer and vocalist Anastasia Lazarenko, whose debut release was demo EP "Lilies" in 2018. Music and words are a psychological image of one person from the darkest depths of emotional experience, thus Edifice concerns music as a miscellaneous, individual and sometimes appalling exposure of identities hidden inside us.
