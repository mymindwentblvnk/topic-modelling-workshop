Formed in Stockholm, 2012, Cape Lion is the outcome when producers/song writers Carl-Johan Sevedag and Martin Wiklund put their heads together. Coming from widely scattered musical backgrounds the duo delivers big and uncompromised pop music with timeless hooks and melodies that stick right from the start.

In early spring 2013 the first single ‘You Kept Dreaming’ was released thus revealing the constellation to the masses. The upcoming 5 song EP is scheduled to be released this spring. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cape+Lion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
