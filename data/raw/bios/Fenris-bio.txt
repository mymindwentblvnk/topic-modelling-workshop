Fenris is a name that has been used several times. (1) A black metal band from the Netherlands. (2) A melodic folk metal band from Texas.  (3) A progressive metal band from Czech Republic.

Fenris (1) is a black metal band from the Netherlands. Fenris was founded in the first winter of 1997 by Bas Westdorp and Vasco. Shortly after that, Gilbert de Rooy joined the guys as a lead-singer. The band's main objective was to make dark and atmospherical black/viking metal with a deep musical approach. In May 1997 Paul van der Zouwen took his place on the drum seat and for the first time, the four guys formed a steady and complete band. Musically, Fenris combines originality, aggression and power to create a broad black-metal repertoire. The lyrics are, among other topics, about pre-Christian beliefs, spirituality, human suffering and a sense of connection with nature and the elements. The lyrics form an important aspect within the creative cycle of the band. For its stronger cultural effect, some of the lyrics are sung in Dutch, the band's native language.

Fenris (2) Fenris is a Melodic Folk metal band from Plano, Texas formed in 2013 that pulls elements and melodies of Pagan music and combines it with the pounding force that is heavy metal.  Debut album "Across the Darkened Skies" released in 2014.
