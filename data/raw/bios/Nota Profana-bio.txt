In late 2008, due to work reasons, Alev, the bands original vocalist, parts ways with the bands. After this the band started a search for a now female voice. In early 2009, the Soprano Gaby Koss (Ex-Haggard and guest singer for Equilibrium) was announced as the band's new singer. Later that year the band released The Lake Demo with demos of four songs from their second album.
