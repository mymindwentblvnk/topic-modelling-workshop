This name is used by more than one artist.
1) Gamine  (MySpace page,  Facebook page) is a London duo that draws heavily on torch songs and French Film Noir. Comprised of vocalist Claudia Barton and composer/producer Ian Williams, the duo create a uniquely dark and seductive sound that you won't find in the midst of the over-synthesized Billboard Top 100.  Clear, lingering notes and hooks on a grand piano are Gamine's arsenal and they come fully loaded. 

2) Gamine was a French pop-rock band of the mid 80's. Their album "Voila les anges" (1988) is one of the nicest French albums of the end of that decade and is still very enjoyable to listen to. Among some other great songs containing some sounds which can remind or announce(?)  the Stone Roses, it contains a nice cover of "May I" from Kevin Ayers.
Following album was quite disappointing except Confessions d'un jeune vaurien. 
They split shortly afterwards.
Released by the beginning of 2006, Revisite 1980/1986 is an album containing rarities from their debut.
