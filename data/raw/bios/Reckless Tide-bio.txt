Reckless Tide was a German thrash metal band.

Since their formation in the year 2000, the Hannover band RECKLESS TIDE have been able to firmly establish themselves in the Thrash Metal scene. After receiving high praise from the press and fans for the debut album REPENT OR SEAL YOUR FATE, they were back with their second album HELLERASER.

Through many live appearances at home and abroad (e.g. Wacken Open Air, Bloodstock, Helleraser European Tour 2007) has helped the band to further develope their style.

The  album envisions a three episode story of the apocalyptic HELLERASER which RECKLESS TIDE interprets with a measure of both seriousness and humour.

They collaborated with musicians to add to the production including Hendrik Bache (Dew Scented) and for a second time, guitar ace Jeff Waters (Annihilator)." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Reckless+Tide">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
