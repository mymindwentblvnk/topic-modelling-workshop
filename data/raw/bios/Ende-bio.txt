1. Ende is a DJ, producer and live act from Palma de Mallorca, Spain. His style has powerful rhythms, big and deep basses with a touch of synthesizer's melodies. He designs his own sounds with real machines for every track - it makes each track unique and full of details; his music is always in constant evolution.
2. Ende was formed 2006 by Death Struggle (drums) and Frost (sometimes called Frostkrieger) (vocals, keyboard, guitar). They describe their muscial style as "Grim And Emotional Black Metal" because of their vocal-style and their lyrics, which are full of desperation, sorrow and hate. "Last Days Of Desperation" will be the last release of Ende, after that they will rest in peace!
