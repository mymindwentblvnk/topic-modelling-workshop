Katie Dey is from Melbourne, Australia, and is a singer/songwriter known for her inventive, unconventionally arranged home-recorded pop tunes. She often twists and distorts her voice into an abrasive croak, lending an extra sense of fragility to her lyrics about fear and isolation. 

Dey had been playing various instruments since her preteen years, and eventually she posted some of her songs on her blog. One of these songs caught the attention of Mat Cothran of Elvis Depressedly, who brought Dey's music to the attention of Warren Hildebrand (Foxes in Fiction), co-owner of Orchid Tapes. 

Dey had long been a fan of the label, so she jumped at the chance to work with them. She released a short album titled asdfasdf for free on her Bandcamp page in 2015, and when Orchid Tapes issued a cassette version, it sold out its first pressing in a day.

She then signed to Joy Void for her second release, the full-length Flood Network, which was released in August of 2016. Dey has kept up a steady stream of activity since, between compilation one-offs and a long series of covers. She released a collaborative album with Devi McCallion called "Some New Form Of Life" in 2018, which was followed up with another collaboration between the two called "Magic Fire Brain", released in 2020.

Dey's second full-length album, solipsisters, was released through Run For Cover records in May of 2019. She has received praise for her work from Pitchfork, NPR, Fader, Vice, SPIN, Goldflakepaint, Stereogum, FACT, and more; counting amongst her fans Frank Ocean, Japanese Breakfast, Elvis Depressedly and a slew of other musicians making the most earnest and creative independent music today. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/katie+dey">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
