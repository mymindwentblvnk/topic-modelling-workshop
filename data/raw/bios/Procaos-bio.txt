Melodic Death Metal from Mexico.

In one of the smallest states of Mexico (Colima), in a city with a very small Metal scene and isolated from the rest of the Metal circuit, Procaos rises as one of the promises in Mexican Metal.

Current line-up:
José Cuevas: Guitars
César García: Bass
Daniel García: Vocals
Enrique Martínez: Drums

At this time, Procaos plays more Death/Thrash Metal than Melodic Death Metal. The band will record a second album sometime in the next months, which will be released next year.
