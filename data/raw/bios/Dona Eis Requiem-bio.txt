Dona eis Requiem is a doom metal band that experiments death metal and black metal influences.

The band was formed in Southern California by vocalist E.R.M. and guitarist J.E. Fluegeman in the spring of 2006. The lineup was completed by the end of the following summer with guitarist C. Bateman, drummer J. Spizter, bassist Kevin C., and keyboardist/sampler M.H.

They released their first demo entitled, "Grant Them Rest" in the spring of 2007, when they opened for 1349 and Nachtmystium in Corona, California. The band then continued to perform live as opening in support of bands such as Inquisition and Katatonia.

Early in 2008, the band had begun to write material for their tentatively-titled full length album, and had received word that M.H. would choose to depart from the band's lineup. Rather than searching for a replacement, the rest of the Dona eis Requiem chose to continue as a 5-piece lineup.

Since then, the band's live performances have been seldom occurrences, especially due to the recording process. They've taken part in live shows in support of bands such as Candlemass, Daylight Dies, Watain, and Rotting Christ.

Recording for the full-length album has been completed and is due for a release in the fall of 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dona+eis+Requiem">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
