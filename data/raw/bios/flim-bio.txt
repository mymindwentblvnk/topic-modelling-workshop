There are two artists bearing the name 'Flim', one based in Germany, and the other based in Canada.

Flim (Germany): Dresden resident Enrico Wuttke is the man behind the name Flim. A project that stands apart from the bedroom IDM world it is lumped with - it just doesn't sound like anything else with his impressionist, introspective tone and pacing, and his delicate melodies.

Flim (Canada): Flim is a project based in symphonic electronic music, with operatic overtones and minimalist execution. Founded in 1998, Flim has had varied influences and has put them to good use in crafting lush soundscapes and heartfelt melodies. 

More on Germany's Flim: Guitar-based laptop folktronica is everywhere at the moment; Wuttke is one of the few artists applying these same ideas (deconstructing and rearranging the deep associations bound up inside the tone of a familiar instrument) to the ancient, cumbersome piano, making heavy use of the tools of the computer age while completely retaining its musicality.
Born in 1971 in Muhlhausen, Germany he has played the piano since the age of 7. He studied fine arts and made his recording debut in 1993 with the release of some private cassettes. In 2001 and 2002 he released 2 highly acclaimed albums for Tomlab. Recent works include the "Holiday Diary" CD on the Plinkity Plonk label in a very limited edition and his present work for a spanish label that is waiting to see the daylight. A follow up album for Tomlab is in the works for 2004. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flim">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
