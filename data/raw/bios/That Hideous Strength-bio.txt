First off, thank you for checking out our page. In case you didn't know, we're That Hideous Strength. There really isn't much to say. I'm not going to sit here and write out a seven-paragraph biography telling you what we sound like, how heartfelt our lyrics are, or what each of the members of the band have done before. I'm simply going to request this of you: Please listen carefully to our songs. Each of us put everything we had into them, and we are very proud of the final result. If you enjoy what you hear, you should check our show dates and come say hi. We would love to play for you.

      Additionally, we just finished up recording a CD with Exeter Recordings at the Canon Road studio in Freehold, New Jersey. The CD was engineered, produced, mixed and even mastered by Joe Dell'Aquila. To say the least...he did work, son. We couldn't be any more proud of anything.

      For booking information, we can be reached via our MySpace (messaging or commenting), by e-mailing us at: thathideousstrengthband@gmail.com, or even on AOL Instant Messenger; The screen name is: THS The Band.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/That+Hideous+Strength">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
