Marge Litch are seminal Japanese symphonic metal. Formed as Mage Lich in the early 80’s as a vehicle for guitarist Yoshiteru Yokoyama, the group released their first cassette album, Rainbow Knight, in 1986. Four subsequent cassette albums followed, with female vocalist Junko Nakagawa joining the group in 1989.

Their first CD release, 1991’s Fantasien, is not their strongest work, but it’s remarkable for arriving at the sound Rhapsody and Nightwish would subsequently hit on several years down the line. Since then, Marge Litch have moved from strength to strength, with Junko’s voice acquiring operatic overtones and growing in confidence and depth. 1992’s Ring Of Truth and 1995’s epic double CD Crystal Heart In The Fountain show definite progress.

1998 saw a re-recording of Fantasien entitled Fantasien 1998. This was their first album to be released outside of Japan (on France’s prolific progressive-rock label Muséa), and improved immesurably on the original. Tomoki Ueno, lead singer of Outer Limits, joined Junko as a duet partner on various tunes.

The band most recently offered a live CD, Particuliöh, in 2000. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Marge+Litch">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
