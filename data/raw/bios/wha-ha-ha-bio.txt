Wha-Ha-Ha were a Japanese avant-prog group who recorded three  records in the early 1980's. Very little information exists regarding the history of the group, at least online, so this biography may contain a few inaccuracies and the like.

The original line-up (which remained relatively constant throughout their lifespan) was Shigetoku Kamiya, Shuichi Chino, Mishio Ogawa, Akira Sakata, Shuichi 'Ponta' Murakami, Takafumi Fuse and Kiyohiko Semba. Semba, an eccentric percussionist and composer, seems to be credited as the band's guiding force. Western ears were first given a chance to sample the band's delights in 1982 on a vinyl compilation put out by Chris Cutler's ReR label, taking tracks from all three of the band's original albums: Shinutokiwa Betsu, 1981, Geta Wo Haite Konacuha, also 1981 and Live Dub, 1982.

As for the actual sounds they produced, I'm sure it won't surprise you to learn that they are rather hard to describe. Jazzy rhythms and squonking saxophone are meticulously blended with laid-back dub synths, manic, often wordless female vocals, free jazz piano breaks, and of course a good deal of percussive jiggery-pokery. The result is something delightfully different, refreshing and entertaining. Over twenty years after they were first recorded, the band's work seems revolutionary and strikingly unique, even within the context of avant-prog and RIO.

In recent times, all three individual albums have been reissued by Absorb Japan and are available as imports which, though pricey, are highly recommended to all RIO/avant-prog fans looking for something a bit more creative than another Zappa or Univers Zero clone. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wha-ha-ha">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
