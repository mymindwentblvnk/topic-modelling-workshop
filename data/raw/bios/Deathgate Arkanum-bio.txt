Deathgate Arkanum is a one man black metal project hailing from Germany. Lestahn is the only member and started this project in 1998. One year later he released his first demo, entitled: "Germanic Fields of Hate". A two track demotape with 10 minutes playtime.. Very low-fi production, but a must have for underground fans! Two years later in 2001 he released his second demo. This was a self released demotape limited to 400 copies. The name on this demo is "Schattenkrieger"! Better production on this demo! In 2004, Haidens Hart & Bloodlust Records releaed a 4 way split with Deathgate Arkanum as one of the artist, The 3 other artist is: Branstock, Cultus and Odal! This release was limited to 500 MLP, first 100 in red vinyl, and is also official in Deathgate Arkanum's Discography! In 2005 Deathgate Arkanum released an another split, this time with Todessto√ü. It was released on a 7" EP and limited to 400 copies. The same year, Lestahn released his first full length entitled: "Totenwerke". Many, including me, thinks that this relased had fit better if it was released as a demo instead of a full length. Althought this was published as a digipack limited to 500 copies. As i mentiond earlier Lestahn do all the instruments, this includes vocals, all instruments, synth and programming! Deathgate Arkanum's music is very synth and keyboard based full of melodies.

In December 2007 Obscure Abhorrence Productions released another 4 way split "Gott in Uns" with The Ruins Of Beverast, Nihil Nocturne & Anti featured. February 13th, 2008, the second full album "Stillhallen" was released by Amor Fati Productions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deathgate+Arkanum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
