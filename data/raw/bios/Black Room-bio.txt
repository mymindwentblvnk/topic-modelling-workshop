In a room without windows, overfilled with synthesizers, guitars, records and computers, the creativity of three minds form the band Black Room. 

The three Norwegians got together over a common passion for moody pop, electronic sounds and live performances, making their own musical universe. Mixing catchy melodies with influences from more beat-oriented music is their trademark, and the band deliver an engraving live-show with lead singer Ole in front, suitably flanked by synthman Paal and guitarist Anders. 

The name Black Room was taken after the house they rehearsed in burned down to the ground, leaving little behind except songs for an album. The name was later changed to Blackroom.
