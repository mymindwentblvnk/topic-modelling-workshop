There are multiple artists under the moniker Drowsy:

1) Drowsy is Mauri Heikkinen, a young singer/songwriter from Finland who writes, sequences, arranges and plays everything himself. Following the receipt of a great demo CDR, his debut release came out as a 7" on FatCat in December 2001, providing a neat introduction to his gently skewed take on pop.

Taking an immediate, lo-fi approach, at times reminiscent of the raw simplicity of The Pastels, at others leaning towards the stark reverberation of Galaxie 500, Drowsy's general demeanour falls somewhere between the melancholic vision of Smog and the post-psychedelic haze inhabited by the likes of Syd Barrett, Alex Chilton or Robert Wyatt.

Mauri has released two albums for Fatcat -  the first from 2005 called 'Growing Green' with "Snow On Moss On Stone" coming out in 2006.

Mauri has his own blog: drowsyo.blogspot.com

2) Drowsy, formally known as “The Baltic”, are a shoegaze/ambient rock band based in Los Angeles. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Drowsy">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
