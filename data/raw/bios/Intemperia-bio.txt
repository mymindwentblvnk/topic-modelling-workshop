Band formed in late 2006 by Carlos Robles, Christian Estepa, Rony Borges and Juls Sosa in Caracas, Venezuela.
Early the band composed power melodic metal music (Aurora EP) but right now their sound has evolved in a combination between metal, rock and some electronic melodies. We'll be able to hear more in the upcoming full length album called ''The Mothman Prophecies''
