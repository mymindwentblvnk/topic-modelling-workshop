Misericorde (Myspace page: http://www.myspace.com/misericordedoom) was formed by former Year Zero bass player Murray Geddes. After trying to assemble a live band, the project essentially became an outlet for Murray's musical ideas. Several songs were written and recorded with Murray supplying both bass and guitar, and a computer brain doing drummer impressions.

The search for additional musicians continued, and after over a year of discussion and umm-ing and ah-ing, and the straightening out of personal business (read getting his shit together), James Moffatt finally decided to get his finger out and pick up a bass once more. Following several successful jams, the rhythm guitar and bass positions were both filled.

In April 2006, the band was complemented by Dave Pinnington on drums.

The band released their first demo, Soundscapes for the Disenchanted in 2008 to favourable reviews (Hellride Music review: http://www.hellridemusic.com/forum/showthread.php?t=17623).  They played their first show in Bradford at Heavyfest IV, and were then included on the line-up of the huge Doom Metal Inquisition V all-day show alongside names such as The Lamp of Thoth, Warning and Pagan Altar.

The band's second demo was released in late 2008 (Hellride Music review: http://www.hellridemusic.com/forum/showthread.php?t=19163) and the band was invited to play the Doomsday all-day show in Wakefield to help celebrate Sealey of Iron Void's birthday, again playing alongside bands such as Pagan Altar, The Lamp of Thoth, Witchsorrow and, of course, Iron Void.

Unfortunately, this show was to be the band's last as the insanity of free-market economics took its toll.  The band was scattered throughout the UK, making future rehearsals impossible and the decision was taken to fold the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Misericorde">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
