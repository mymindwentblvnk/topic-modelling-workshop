Sublime Cadaveric Decomposition (SCD) is a grindcore group founded in 1996 and originally from Paris, France. They are, along with groups like Blockheads and Inhumate, pioneers of this style in France.

This group delivers an extreme music, characterized by very fast drum beats, guitar riffs accompanied by saturated guttural voices and screamed. The group celebrates its 15th anniversary with his fourth and latest album - "SHEEP'N'GUNS" - released September 27, 2011. The design and logo have changed again, sticking more to their musical style. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sublime+Cadaveric+Decomposition">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
