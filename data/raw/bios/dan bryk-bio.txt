Dan Bryk is a Canadian geek-pop pioneer who has written some of the funniest and saddest music ever... sometimes even in the same song. He also has a total gift for the sweet melody over the least expected chord changes! But most of all, he is a really emotionally honest songwriter who can either be a dick or a total sweetheart, but is totally unashamed to let it all hang out in his songs.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Bryk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
