1) 
Evolve is the down-tempo electronica of Los Angeles musician Red Broad AKA DJ Red and singer Margo Reymundo.
Their debut outing, Happy Hour In The Gene Pool is a delightful blend of lounge pop, subtle beats, found sound, and mellow jazz influences, a lounge lizardâ€™s idea of heaven on Earth. The overall vibe is predominantly mellow, and the arrangements ooze sophistication and depth. Singer Margo Reymundo features on two tracks contributing her distinctive raspy, Billy Holiday-esque jazzy vocal stylings to "Couldn't Be More Wrong" and "The Way Back", with rapper Tantrum providing the testosterone on "By Definition: Cool" and "Mice on the Ice".

2)
Evolve is a straight edge hardcore band from Maura, Norway. They started out in 2009 and are heavily influenced by late 80's/early 90's hardcore.
