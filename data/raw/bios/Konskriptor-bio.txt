Konskriptor came out of Toowoomba, Queensland in February 2010 as a 4-piece Thrash Metal band founded by Tommy Muz (vocals), Chris Clark (guitars) and Michael Hunter (drums). After their first gig with Gater Jameson filling bass duties, they sourced Dan Watson to fill in another guitar slot to pump up their live sound.
The band gigged successfully throughout 2010 in Toowoomba and Brisbane, releasing a 3-track demo later that year. 2011 saw all but one member move to Brisbane and heralded the release of their first 6-track EP, "EP(MS)", a play on their song title "PMS". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Konskriptor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
