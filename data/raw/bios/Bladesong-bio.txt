Fueled by magnanimous compositions and a fiery thrash ensemble, Bladesong manifests a unique orchestral metal experience. This group's influences range from the classics of Heavy Metal to the cannon of Western Art music.  Their goal is to feature a captivating sound that could be described as cinematic, underscored by theatrical performances,  a dramatic stage presence, and orchestra-ready arrangements. Bladesong is aware of a turning tide in the contemporary music industry and is branching out to such things as orchestral performances, musicals, and the opportunity to be a sideshow at the Renaissance Festival!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bladesong">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
