Alaska in Winter is an American electronic band, consisting of front man Brandon Bethancourt, who dropped out of art school in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and reportedly, "spent a semester in a tiny cabin out in the middle of nowhere Alaska recording music on a laptop during the winter", and which later came to be known as the project, "Alaska in Winter". Bethancourt later went back to New Mexico and enlisted the help of fellow musicians, Zach Condon (Beirut), Heather Trost (A Hawk and a Hacksaw), Hari Ziznewski (Rap), Stefanie Lamm, Rosina Roibal, Hilary Bethancourt, and Naila Dixon to help with his later musical compositions. The band has garnered some of its fame in part due to Zach Condon's appearance on their debut album, Dance Party in the Balkans.

Bethancourt has been living in Berlin, Germany, where he recorded his second album, Holiday, which was released November 17, 2008 (Europe) / 18th (US). After releasing "Holiday," Bethancourt moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he currently resides.
