Channel Zero is a Belgian metal band. Franky DSVD (current project: Skitsoy), Xavier Carion (current project: Sons Of Jonathas), Tino DeMartino and Phil B. (R.I.P. August 10th, 2013) came together in Brussels (Belgium) in 1990. They started 'Channel Zero', inspired on the 'Public Enemy' song 'She Watch Channel Zero'. In August 1997 Channel Zero anounced the split of the band. Meanwhile they had produced five albums: Channel Zero (1992), Stigmatized for life (1993, mixed by Vinnie Paul of Pantera), Unsafe (1994), Black Fuel (1997) and a live album Channel Zero Live (1997) which contained a recording of their gig at Marktrock Leuven in 1997. As the reason for the split, different causes were cited: artistic differences, the failed attempt to consolidate the international break-through, as well as the demise of metal to commercial Britney Spears music and the like. Ironically, shortly after the split, metal became commercially more mainstream through Nu Metal (e.g. Deftones). 

In 2010, Channel Zero made a widely noted comeback. At the request of fans, they played six reunion concerts in Brussels which quickly sold-out. They also released a new single. They are also scheduled to play at Graspop Metal Meeting (Dessel). In January 2010, Channel Zero features a slightly different line-up: Mikey Doling (ex-Soulfly, ex-SNOT) replaces Xavier Carion on lead guitar, since the latter suffers from ear damage.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Channel+Zero">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
