Eskhata - Melodic Folk Metal Band from Serbia


The story of this band goes way back before the present band. The first form of the band dates back in 2007, when then young friends wanted to play heavy music and create some of their own. Petar, Djura and later Nemanja went to hell and back with their home studios. Everytime they started something new to , they would always stumble on obstacles such as low quality gear, 
fights in the band, lack of creativity and proffesionality from some members. So the idea was shutted down in the beginings of 2009, and the guys promised to get back againlater, when they get some skills.
Desperetly to start something new, Djura created Eskhata couple of months later, writting songs day and night, comitting to the band 101%, just to make everything perfect. Writting lyrics, riffs, making a logo, he had a vision of a band which make room for his idea in the metal scene.Getting Nemanja in the band was a relief for Djura, because Nemanja mastered the english language
and he is a solid guitarits. After months and months of hard work, blood sweat and tears, the songs
were ready. In the meantime, guys were reunited with Petar, which made the smiles on their faces to strech to their ears. During the recording, Nemanja was not capable for team work, and thus for, he was asked to quit. In the meantime, Eskhata camp got a old friend of Djura, Stevan Miletic. A singer which can sing and play guitar. Soon Jelena Ilic joined band as rhythm guitarist. Soon after Jelena joined band, Djura's decided that Stevan play Bass Guitar. Band got a horse size morale boost injection, and the four songs are finished. Two weeks from finishing DEMO, Dimitrije joined band as a drummer.

The story will be continued ...
