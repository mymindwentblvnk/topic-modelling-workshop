Midnattsol is a nordic folk metal band from Norway and  Germany. The band was formed in 2002 and currently consists of vocalist Carmen Elise Espenæs (younger sister of Liv Kristine Espenæs of Leaves' Eyes and ex-Theatre of Tragedy), bassist Birgit Öllbrunner, drummer Chris Merzinsky, keyboardist Daniel Fischer, and guitarist Daniel Droste. Guitarist Christian Hector recently announced his departure and the band is currently searching for a new guitarist.

Their sound is essentialy symphonic metal, with some folk influences in the melodies. Their lyrics are largely based on Norwegian folk tales. Their first full-length album, "Where Twilight Dwells", was released in 2005; their second album, "Nordlys", was released on March 28, 2008.

Midnattsol means "midnight sun" in Norwegian. Although their sound can be classified as symphonic metal, the band prefers to call their style "nordic folk metal" because of the folk elements in their music and occasional Norwegian lyrics.

Guitarists Daniel Droste and Christian Hector are also playing in Ahab, a German funeral doom metal band.

Chris Merzinsky and Birgit Öllbrunner are also playing in the band R:I:P.
