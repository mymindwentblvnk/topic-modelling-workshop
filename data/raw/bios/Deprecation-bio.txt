Deprecation was formed in 2009 in Austria by Luki as an one-man project. The musical style is a mix of Death and Black-Metal and Accoustic-Guitar music with Progressive influences.

On March 1st the first album “Death and Misanthropy” was released. This record contains 12 very different and diversified tracks. The total runtime is about 68 minutes. The album is a self production. 
Three tracks on this record, which are definitely more Black-orientated, contain Guest-vocals of 2 musicians: The screams on “Mystical Shine” and “Dark Rain” are by Noctar from the Austrian Black-act “Schwarzkristall”, the vox on the opener-track “About Suicide” are from Dominik R. which runs the Progressive-Metal project “Briongloid”. All other vocals, which are more Death-Metal like are done by Luki.

Deprecation’s lyrics are primary about Death, Hate and Misanthropy but also about Evil Mights and Depressions. Some songtexts are very critical against many problems, for example the destructive and egoistic human-way of life.
