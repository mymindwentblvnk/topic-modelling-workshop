Rising from the lowest depths of the San Francisco underground metal scene, the scourge that is Artificium Sanguis takes no prisoners in it's continuing Crimes of Atrocity Against Humanity. Known for it's wild, visceral, performances that sometimes seem teetering on the verge of implosion, Artificium Sanguis has built a reputation as a go-for the-throat live beast that is at once unpredictable and striking. A band that challenges it's attending captives to move one step beyond or move out of the way. Their first recording, "Ye Olde Demo Taype" showed a strong and furious debut, sounding more than the sum of it's parts. Recorded by the band themselves on two microphones during a live practice - with vocal and 2nd guitar overdubs added later - it stands as a clear portrait of the Artificium Sanguis way... direct, destructive, and always to the point. As apathy, pretense, and complacency are the disease... Artificium Sanguis are the cure. - Orson Welles
