There is more than one band with the name Brawl.

[1] BRAWL is the original Hardcore band from Boise, Idaho. Established in 1994. After a hiatus, Brawl is back and working on the 4th album. Slated to be out in March 2010. Brawl mixes the best elements of hardcore and metal. Brawl is Heavy American Hardcore and is here to stay. There are many things that influence Brawl but striving to increase the awareness about the criminal activity of our large corporations and our own government is the number one influence. Brawl considers themselves true patriots not home grown terrorists like they would have you believe. Brawl actually takes a strong stance against terrorism and extremist groups. Brawl has played with and or admires many bands worldwide. Sick of it All, H2O, Madball, Biohazard, Agnostic Front, Death Before Dishonor, Blood for Blood, Hatebreed, xTYRANTx, Lionheart, Winds of Plague, Slayer, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Soulfly, Sepultura, Cavalera Conspiracy, Obituary, Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse, Machine Head, etc... Many Punk, Metal, and Hardcore bands.
