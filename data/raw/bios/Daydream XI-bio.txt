In 2005 Osmium was formed, a band with no big pretensions, playing covers only. In the following years the group began to write their own songs. Along with their musical indentity development, the band have managed to earn fans over the time as well as maturity. 

In the late 2008 the group has shown up their new stage, DAYDREAM XI. With this new name the quintet formed by Tiago Masseti (vocals), Marcelo Pereira (guitar), C치ssio de Assis (guitar), Tom치s Gonzaga (bass) and Bruno Giordano (drums) have presented its prog/power metal releasing its first EP, named "Humanity's Prologue" (available here in the myspace page), counting with the production of the guitarist Renato Osorio (Magician, Scelerata, Fighterlord). 

In 2010 Daydream XI releases a new single , The Guts of Hell, working once again with the producer. The band is currently writing the material to record their first full album.
