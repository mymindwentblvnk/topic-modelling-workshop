Hans SÃ¶llner is a bavarian singer and songwriter from the town of Bad Reichenhall (Germany). In earlier years he published mostly humourous (and often insulting) songs, but recently he turned to making more serious reggae tunes.

Because of his insultations (mostly of bavarian politicians) and the use of marijuana he has been repeatedly sued and also often sentenced to record-high fines. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Hans+S%C3%B6llner">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
