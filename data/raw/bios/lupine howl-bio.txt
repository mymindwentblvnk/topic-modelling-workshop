Lupine Howl was a British rock band formed in Bristol in 1999 by Sean Cook (vocalist, bassist), Mike Mooney (guitarist) and Damon Reece (drummer). The three had been dismissed from their respective roles in Spiritualized by that band's frontman, Jason Pierce.

The first single, "Vaporizer" was released in 2000 on their own Vinyl Hiss record label. It peaked at No. 68 in the UK Singles Chart. This was followed by a deal with Beggars Banquet Records and an album, The Carnivorous Lunar Activities of Lupine Howl, in 2001. The Bar at the End of the World followed in 2002, with Johnny Mattock replacing Damon Reece on drums. 

The group disbanded before a third album could be recorded and Sean Cook went on to record as The Flies, while Mooney went on to work with The Wild Swans and Applecraft.
