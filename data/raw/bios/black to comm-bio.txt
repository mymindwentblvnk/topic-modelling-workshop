Black To Comm is the solo project of German sound artist Marc Richter. Through his output both as an artist and through his eclectic Dekorder label, Richter has established himself as a singular voice of new music. Operating at the fringes of drone and ambient, his music is darkly magical and deeply atmospheric, underpinned by a signature surrealism. A relentless sonic explorer, Richter approaches the studio as his instrument, using sampling, analogue production and digital manipulation to offer an almost infinite choice of tones and textures. Audio fragments are liberated from their original context and sculpted into surprising new shapes, creating work that transcends time or genre. 
Richter creates his music using scratchy shellac and vinyl records, field recordings, a so called "kitchen gamelan," and more traditional instruments like organs, guitars, pianos and mbiras. The layering and hypnotic repetition of short loops from Psychedelia, Free Jazz, Vaudeville, and various other old recordings reveals alternative melodic dimensions not apparent in the source material. His work evokes a contradictory feeling of lightness and intensity, a bittersweet melancholy tempered by the chill of something ominous beneath the surface.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+To+Comm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
