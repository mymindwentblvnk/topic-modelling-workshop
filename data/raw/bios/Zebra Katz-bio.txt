Pulling from a multimedia and performance art background, Zebra Katz brings a slo-mo dark delivery to his rhymes, which are set over a minimal, unencumbered beat on his highly acclaimed first single "IMA READ" (Mad Decent/Jeffrrees). "IMA READ" was heralded as the "Official Song of Paris Fashion Week" after Rick Owens personally chose it to score his Fall/Winter Womenswear runway show.

Zebra Katz is capstone creation of 32 year old New York multidisciplinary artist Ojay Morgan. Inspired by Nina Simone, Andre 3000, Missy Elliot, James Blake, and Lauryn Hill. Morgan has cultivated a signature and unique presence all his own. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zebra+Katz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
