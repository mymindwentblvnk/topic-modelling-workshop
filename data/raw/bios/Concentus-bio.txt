A danish death/black metal act from 1995 who only released two demoes. The first called "Promo 97", the second called "Return of The Priest". They broke up around the time of the last demo.

After the breakup of the band, some went to from Nightshade, and some went to Exekrator.

This is also the artist listing for many tracks in the Norton Anthology of Western Music collection of CDs for music history classes (primarily chant pieces off the first CD of the first volume of CDs). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Concentus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
