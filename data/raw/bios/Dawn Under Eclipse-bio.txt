DAWN UNDER ECLIPSE is a project started in late 2004 out of a true passion for metal, rock and death metal, shared by all members.

The early releases ("Eclipse" EP 2005; "Human Frailty" EP 2007) get only positive reviews and top demos; these works are also able to please many field's experts, thanks to a fresh and powerful songwriting, that leads those guys on their way to burst on the scene, letting 'em manage to play in several prestigious venues, as HEINEKEN JAMMIN' FESTIVAL (also hosting that day: Iron Maiden, Stonesour, Mastodon), Rock TV Halloween Night, HTL Fest.

Their nonstop live activity also lets 'em share the stage with great names such as: Extrema, The Modern Age Slavery, Slowmotion Apocalypse, Ephel Duath, Node, Empyrios... As inevitable, these fast years deeply reshape the project in its line-up, sound and style.

In 2009 the band's debut album "FROM END TO END" is recorded by SIMONE MULARONI in italian famous FEAR STUDIOS. "From End to End" is licensed by GRAVES RECORDS, and will be spread throughout Europe with GLORY BOUND TOUR '09 and with the videos for the songs "Collision" and "Hailstorm" directed by LEON GAIG.

At the end of 2010 the band recorded the new album "UNIVERSUS", produced, mixed and mastered by SIMONE MULARONI at DOMINATION STUDIO.
It will see a natural evolution in terms of sound, bringing metal to the edge of its genre, but still spacing through mellow, catchy atmospheres.

DUE signs with the belgian label ULTIMHATE RECORDS, which will release "Universus" in june 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dawn+Under+Eclipse">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
