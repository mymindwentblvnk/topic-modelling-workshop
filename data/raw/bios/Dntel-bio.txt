Dntel is the solo project of Jimmy Tamborello. Dntel is known for mixing glitch and cut-up electronic techniques with instruments like acoustic guitars, accordions, and symphonic instruments. Dntel is also the project that spawned The Postal Service.

He started working as Dntel, pronounced Din-tell, in 1994. A collection of tracks created between 1995-1997 (Early Works For Me If It Works For You) was released on the Phthalo label in 1999, followed by the release of an EP recorded in 1994 (Something Always Goes Wrong) in 2000. After contributing a song to Plug Research's Voices In My Lunchbox compilation he was invited to do a full length for the label, preceded by a 12" EP (Anywhere Anyone).

Dntel released his full-length album Life Is Full Of Possibilities in 2001. The LP featured vocal contributions by many artists, including Death Cab For Cutie's Ben Gibbard on the breakout track (This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan, which led to a single in 2002 and later, the formation of the band The Postal Service with Gibbard. With vocals buried in static, cut-up acoustic guitars and sampled symphonies struggling to find somewhere to settle, Life Is Full Of Possibilities reserved Dntel's spot as a pioneer of contemporary glitch, electro-pop, and indietronica. 

Tamborello is currently working with The Postal Service and continuing his solo work, including remixes for various artists. As Dntel, he is releasing a compilation, Early Works For Me If It Works For You II, which will feature unfinished instrumental tracks from when he was working on Life Is Full Of Possibilities in 1998-2001, to be released on Phthalo. He released his newest full-length LP, titled "Dumb Luck" on April 24, 2007.  "Dumb Luck" is his first LP on Sub Pop records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dntel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
