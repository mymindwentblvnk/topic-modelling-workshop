There are two artists named Amadea:

1) A Hungarian gothic metal band
2) A Russian singer-songwriter

1) Amadea is a gothic metal band from Hungary since 2003.

The members of the band played also in another band likewise named Amadea, from 2003 to 2005. In these two years their work was quite difficult because of the continuous member changes, therefore the original Amadea broke off on the March of 2005. On May 2005  Barnabás Balogh and Botond Major founded the new Amadea, joined by almost every old member. (Emese P.-Holl, Tibor Horváth, Tamás Kiss, Mátyás Németh Szabó) This setup stabilized by the entry of Barbara Balogh. Our debut was on the 26th October 2005 in Sopron, at the Hangár Music Garden. Later on the October of 2005 we've won the talent contest Határock nélkül, in Szekszárd. Therefore the local media (radio, tv, local news) spotted us. On the December of 2005 the band recorded its first three songs. On December 2005 we've returned to Szekszárd, where we had the opportunity to give a concert unforgettable for all members. On January 2006 the bands guitarist Mátyás Németh Szabó quit the band, continuing his career at the band Echo of Dalriada/Dalriada. Later that month Tamás Kiss and Emese P.-Holl also quit our formation. On January we've found our new vocalists: Ágnes Cser and Márton Sass. On the March of 2006 we've played before the finnish Charon, later that month finishing our first EP Grey of the morning, which is available for download. We have found our new guitarist called Schmiedl Balázs in 2006. End of that year Barbara Balogh left the band, Barnabás Ungár came to his place.
