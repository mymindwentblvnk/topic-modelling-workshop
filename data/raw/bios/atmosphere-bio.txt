There are, at least, four artists known as Atmosphere: 1) An American alternative rap band. 2) A Polish rock band. 3) An Italian disco group. 4) A Vietnamese metal band.

Atmosphere originally consisted of Spawn (MC), ANT (producer) and Slug (DJ, at the time). After Spawn left the group (now rapping under the name Rek The Heavyweight) the line up was set, with Slug, ANT and a rotating DJ. Currently the group consists of rapper Slug (Sean Daley), producer Ant (Anthony Davis) and Touring DJ Mr. Dibbs (Brad Forste). Slug is also one of the co-founders of a Minneapolis hip hop label called Rhymesayers Entertainment. The band has had hit singles on a variety of Billboard charts in the United States: 2002's "Modern Man's Hustle" went to #18 on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart and 2008's "You" hit #38 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. Atmosphere's albums include Overcast! (1997), God Loves Ugly (2002), Seven's Travels (2003), You Can't Imagine How Much Fun We're Having (2005), When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold (2008), The Family Sign (2011), Southsiders (2014), Fishing Blues (2016), Mi Vida Local (2018), Whenever (2019), and The Day Before Halloween (2020).

Atmosphere was awarded the Album debut of the year 1997 by magazine Tylko Rock and was nominated for the award Fryderyk in 1998 in the category Debut of the Year.
