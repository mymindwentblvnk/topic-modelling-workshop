Biography
Reject The Sickness Is a modern Metal Band with a metal-core twist. The band is based in Ghent (Belgium) and formed in 2010. RTS understands the delicate balance between skills and brutality in their music. Their creations are a mixture of punching death-melodic guitar riffs with lots of new-school characteristics. Their first mini CD 'Bloodstained Eyes' (December 2012) is the result of their hard work and passion for metal music. They are dying to play at your venue.
The band was formed in 2007-2008. Guy (vocals) and Ruben (guitars) are the two remaining members that where there at the early years of the band. We had a hard time finding a good solide line up, with people who loved the groove of metal the way we do. With the brothers Pepijn (lead guitars) and Floris (bass) and drummer Kris we have found the missing link that connects and creates the sound of Reject the Sickness.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Reject+The+Sickness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
