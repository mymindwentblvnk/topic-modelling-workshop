F.R.Y. were formed in the late summer of 2006 by Dron on guitar and vocals, Jay on guitar, and Voron on bass. Having played with rather well-known local bands (Metka, Citadel, Horizon 8), the musicians left them for various reasons and started a brand new band. They just decided to play what they liked, modern metal music with English lyrics.

By September, F.R.Y. had chosen some songs for their first demo/promo CD Orange Demo[n], and entered DDHStudio to record it. The CD was released in February 2007 and was met with mixed reaction.

In March 2007, H.D. joined the band on drums and they began playing live shows.

By autumn of 2007, F.R.Y. had released two live promo DVDs, "Live At Roks Club" and "Orlandina Metal Blast". In September 2007, they release the Internet single "Illusions.ru" and the promo video "Russia! Vodka! Tetris!", which again got hot response.

In winter 2007/2008 F.R.Y. start recording a full-length album, but it is lost with half of the line-up (Dron & Jay) as a result of unfavourable events. 

In the summer of 2008, the second [unfinished] video "Illusions" and "The Making of "Russia! Vodka! Tetris!" documentary are released. In September Jay is back, and the line-up is completed by Kert (vocals), known as the frontman of Antisacrum, and Andrew (guitar), ex-EFiS. F.R.Y. start preparing new songs in Russian.

F.R.Y. have their own cool and original style, successfully balancing between metal and alternative, adding elements of various styles from funk metal to rapcore. Over one year, the band have developed a unique sound and a signature, informal style of playing live, full of drive and positive energy. In underground circles, F.R.Y. are known not only by their music experiments, but also by creative and original promo and live videos.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/F.R.Y.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
