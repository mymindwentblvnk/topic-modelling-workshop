Cadaver Symposium was regarded as one of the staple acts of the Maryland death metal scene along side bands such as Dying Fetus, Sadistic Torment, Hatred, Deceased, Horror of Horrors and Earthborn to name a few. Having gone through a few lineup changes, it wasn't until 1994 when the final lineup was solidified as Mike Harrison on Bass & Vocals, Yiloiz Santiago on Guitar & Vocals, Jeff Gerlach on Guitar and Mike Perigo on Drums. In 1995, they recorded two demos which saw limited release. Cadaver Symposium only played a handful of shows in the Maryland, DC, Delaware Virginia areas - some opening for acts such as Sweden's Entombed and thrash legends Forbidden. In early 1996 they began recording what was to be considered their first "true" release. It was completely recorded... but turmoil in the band led all members to disband and move on with their lives. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cadaver+Symposium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
