Formed in 1993 in Bergen, Norway, these 'dark' death metallers released their first demo in 1994 entitled Walk My Path.

In their first albums like Dark Sorcery, Beyond the Wandering Moon and ... And So The Night Became they play a "dark" kind of black metal with atmospheric elements and  darker passages, partially achieved by tuning their instruments lower than is typical of black metal acts.  With Shadows of Old they moved to a  more typical Florida-style death metal.

They have toured in Europe with such bands as Enslaved, Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Behemoth, Marduk, Mayhem, Red Harvest, Emperor and Limbonic Art. Their album Hexaeon was released in 2006.
