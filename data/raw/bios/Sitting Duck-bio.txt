Sitting Duck is a Lofi Beats project that has been brought into life in the end of 2019 and celebrated it´s first official releases in 2020. The little duck has quickly established itself among the big names of the genre, releasing Songs at the style-defining Lofi Records and various other Instrumental-HipHop oriented labels. Taking inspiration from various musical influences ranging from Jazz over Lounge to Indie, Sitting Duck´s name is synonymous with warm and meditative tunes that set a relaxed and mindful atmosphere, perfect to either let your mind fly, or to set the ambience for a deeply focused work or study session.
Next to the music, Sitting Duck was also conceived to carry the philosophy of fraternity amongst all living beings out in the world. Placing the aspects of loving intention and community at the core of all its endeavors, Sitting Duck promotes the idea of coming together as one, rather than competing with each other. This approach shows in the way the Duck integrated itself in the beatmakers-scene, collaborating with an ever-growing circle of friends and likeminded musicians, contributing to the tightly knit web of artists who make up the core of the genre. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sitting+Duck">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
