Skulled is a five-member Thrash Metal band from Bremen, Germany.
The band was founded by drummer Tim and lead guitarist Olli in 2008, bass player Lenz and former
rhythm guitarist Fubsi joined in 2009 and after a few changes at the vocals, today's singer Nordic
completed the quintet in 2012. Lately, rhythm guitarist Fubsi left Skulled and was replaced by Jannes.
In early 2013 Skulled recorded their first Demo CD "Demo[n] Inside" at the "Hoerwerk
Tonstudio" in Bookholzberg, Germany. Their debut album "Chaos Through Order" was recorded in
August 2014 at the "Soundlodge Studios" in Rhauderfehn, Germany, under the direction of Jörg
Uken. It was released by the band (without a label) in fall 2014.
The band's style is marked by the combination of aggressive, no-compromise Thrash as
Pantera and Kreator with modern Metal Genres.
On stage Skulled perform high-energy shows with a lot of fun and some self-mockery,
presenting fat, fast and groovy riffs, memorable melodies and their socio-critical lyrics. This was
proved on regional stages, such as the "Meisenfrei" (Bremen, GER), the "Magazinkeller" (Bremen,
GER), the "Knust" (Hamburg, GER), the "LOGO" (Hamburg, GER) or the "Nexus" (Brunswick, GER) as
well as at small festivals like the "Dragonfield Open Air" (Lemwerder, GER), "Hansemosh" (Bremen,
GER) or "Scheunengedräsche" (Bassum, GER) as support act of Witchburner, Misconceived or Sudden
Death.
