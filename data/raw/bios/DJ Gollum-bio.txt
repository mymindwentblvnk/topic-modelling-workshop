Real Name: Lars Böge
Profile: In the year 1993 (already in a technoinfected stadium) DJ Gollum met DJ Hunter at a small village-club. After a lot of some delicious Southern/Ginger they decided to buy two turntables and a mixer. They started to play at some privatparties.. well, thats the typical way, I guess. 1994 was the year of Gollum's first bookings. His first gig was at the "Secret" in Wedel (nowadays called Maxx Musichall). In the same year the "Master of desaster - as he sometimes called himself) bought his first studio-equipment and soon followed his debut-single-release „Gollum + Gary D. - Black Arrows“ on EDM Rec. Some few months later: "Plastic Enemy" with "Bulldozer". 

Because of the big success of his productions, DJ Gollum had the chance to play, for the first time ever, overseas in 1996 at the Nosebleed in Scottland. More bookings followed in the UK, Switzerland and Barcelona, Spain where he dropped his pumping sound in front of 10.000 people. 

DJ Gollum is currently resident at "Devil Mania / EFX", Hamburg and at the "Raveolution", Fantasy Music Hall in Tarp. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Gollum">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
