Origin:
This project had it’s origins arround October 2004, but it’s lineup stability was only achieved in April  2005, when, to the existing formation, composed of Tiago Alves, Igor Freitas and David Rodrigues, was added Hélio Freitas and José Ribeiro.
The group´s creation´s at first started to roam erratically towards a typical heavy metal influence, concluding with the overall insatisfaction of the band, forcing a new method of composing and writting.

New seeds: 
Sacrificing time, in favour of better songs, the group decided to let personal influences flow in each composition, therefore creating something that sounds more like us and less like someone else.

New Horizons:
With a new and improved sound, the band started thinking about new forms of showmanship. Meaning: a new live visual, better ways of promoting the band, and of course, new gear.

The group is looking forward to finish new songs and start the live action.
