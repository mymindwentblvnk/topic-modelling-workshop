"Necrite was formed in 2004 as Thrull's solo project under the name Frozen Shade. After recording The Grave demo with his brother Jason on session drums. In May 2005, Thrull began seeking members for a live line-up. He recruited Nefarion on bass, and fellow musicians Malick on drums and Wraith on guitar. Shortly into rehersals, they began writing material collectively and decided to form a full band and changed the name to Necrite. Necrite began recording their first full-length album in early 2006, and finally, after as many as 5 demos have been made between 2004 and 2009, the debut full-length is set to be released by Flenser Records on November 2, 2010.

As of June 2006 Wraith left the band to pursue his solo project and was replaced by Infydel, mastermind of Trayjen. Nefarion also left to focus on his new project, Nefarion."
