It's at the beginning of the 90's that You Oshima, founder member of Kadenzza, begins his musical career and forms his first group Black Maria. In 1993, the group carries out a single of six tracks which already included early versions of Kamikaze Blows and Wheel of Fortune that got their final forms 10 years later.

After the split of Black Maria in 1993, You moves to Tokyo in 1996, then to New York in 1997, to come back in Japan only in 1998. During this period he studies music and musical programming.

At the end of 2002 he solely composes four tracks under name Kadenzza. At the start of 2003, these songs are put out under the name of The Reality In The Phantasmagoric World. In June of the same year, the French label Holy Records signs Kadenzza and releases his first revolutionary album Into The Oriental Phantasma.

In September 2005, the Japanese artist with exacerbated frenzy does it again and submits his second album torn between intimism and hysteria to the world. The Second Renaissance is a sequence of multiple inspirations where extreme black metal offers its entries within virtuoso symphonic and innovative music.
