Gravebomb started out as a brainchild by Patrik and Petter while both parts were looking to play death metal of the older kind, something based on the old Swedish bands like Dismember and Entombed. Thrash metal drummer Leon joined the two shortly aswell as Petters brother, bass player and music theory expert Sven. With the chainsaw sounding HM-2 maxed out the band is currently writing a big load of oldschool sounding songs to be played live very soon.
