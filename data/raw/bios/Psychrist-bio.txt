Psychrist was a Death metal band from Australia formed in 1992. The music is dark and furious with Black Metal touch and extremely deep growls. Sounds like mix between Suffocation and Vital Remains. The lyrics are about satanism, antichristianity, etc. They recorded one demo in 1992, one EP in 1994 "The Abysmal Fiend" and two albums - "Embrace Rapture In Disgust" (1999), "Debauching The Minnions" (2001). 
Psychrist broke up in November 2003 due to irreconcilable issues between band members. Two of its members are now in the Technical Death Metal band Infinitum. Two other members are now in the Black/Thrash Metal band Kill For Satan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Psychrist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
