Whereas the hot summer of 2011 drew nearly everyone to the local beach or bar, snipping colourful cocktails, four dudes spent their leisure time at an old dirty practice room, drinking beer and trying to figure out what the heart of every band is; riffs, riffs and yes, even more riffs. Not restricting themselves to any kind of genre, they shamlessly draw influences from your mumâ€˜s lovely hippie bands of the 70s, to classic desert-driven Stoner-Rock, over to Postrock melodies and fuzzy Sludge Riffs. Sativa Root play instrumental music, covering the full range between heavy discordant parts and soft melodic passages. That's it, that's all. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sativa+Root">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
