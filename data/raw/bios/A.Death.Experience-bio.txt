founded back in the days of 2004 by paul and michael, a.death.experience achieved a permanent lineup in 2006 when manuel (bass) and martin (leadguitar) joined the band as persistent members.

a.death.experience also recorded their first demo cd in 2006 containing three tracks of uncompromising melodic deathmetal, that lead the band among others to gigs with hatesphere (dk), aborted (b) and dagoba (fr) in 2007.
