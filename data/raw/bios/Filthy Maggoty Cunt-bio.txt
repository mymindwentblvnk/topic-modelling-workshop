FMC Began in 1999 as a FUCK YOU to the metal scene. Nu Metal was everywhere and Black Metal had become homicides. It was time for some Comedy Relief.
Formed by Transgender Rocker Jade Starr aka Sistah Fister who recorded the debut FMC CD Sadomasadistikwankore using a Sony Playstation as back up drummer. The CD Featured 9 Tracks of pure unadulterated toilet humor combined with Trashy metal riffs and Gutteral Vocals. The CD attracted
many fans for some reason so Fister began to recruit a Full Band to play live shows.

With the basic line up in order FMC began to terrorize the Melbourne Metal Scene. Early Shows were a shambles, Shows were filled with the band members fighting on stage, the playstation blew up and even their own Sound Engineer was hurling insults at the band. As the band actually only practiced
once a month it took a while for the material to sound even slightly in time, but alas it did get better.

FMC began to do themed shows such as DragShows, Hip Hop shows with DJ's, Boy Band Shows with all the songs programmed into Boyzone style, Dinner Party Shows, Progressive Metal Tribute Nights and Tributes to Jesus Shows (Easter). FMC Featured Stand Up Comedians, Amputees, DJ's, Scat Artists,
Unplugged Shows,Raided Road Runner Records Office Invaded S11 & M1 protests @ Crown Casino and Melbourne CBD Air Guitar Comps, They Trashed many venues and many peoples eardrums over the 4 years of Mayhem Till 2003 when on tour it was rumored that their Tour bus drive off a cliff on The Pacific HWY.
