Blasphemy and desecration gave birth to The Uncreation in the Gregorian year AD2001. Many beers later The Uncreation began recording in November 2004 at Sovereign Studios with Aidan Barton. Dreaming in R’lyeh was released during the Australian Winter on July 15 2006.

Dreaming in R’lyeh is a working combination of black/death ritual art w/elements of thrash, doom and horror interwoven by classical music and acoustic interludes in foul and obtuse minor keys............
