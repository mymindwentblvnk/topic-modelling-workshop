1. Black Canvas make music straight from the heart, music with consciousness. Their debut album ‘Rise’ is simply complex, inspired by life, naturally grown and delivered personally. This album is a distillation of experience, gained first hand from living in ‘the land of the blind’. The essence of the music is love and faith,courage, tenderness, generosity and sacrifice.

Mr. Melody and Rider Shafique, both hail from Gloucester and grew up in its inner city, immersed in Caribbean culture, cutting their teeth in and around the reggae music scene. Beyond their hometown, Melody has worked along side the production duo of Pressure Drop, featuring on two of their LPs, namely ‘Elusive’ and ‘Tread’, Melody is perhaps best known for his vocals on the classic breaks anthem‘Warrior Sound’ remixed by Adam Freeland. Later Melody would feature on Adam Freeland’s ‘Now and Them’ project. Whilst Shafique had his debut 12” ‘Rider (Rhyme Provider’)’ released on One Eye Records in 2004 and has since collaborated on various recordings with Pressure Drop, Black Grass, Chase & Status and Al Haca amongst others.

They both strive to follow a righteous path and rise above the pitfalls of everyday life. This is the recurrent theme throughout the album, eloquently recounting everyday battles with themselves and the society that surrounds them. Their debut LP conveys a straightforward but refined musical message of defiant realism. Produced and co-written by ChubbyJ from Pressure Drop, Rise is instilled with a passionate attitude that transgresses today’s genres and boundaries. Incorporating the roots of Reggae and stems of Hip Hop intertwined with a soulful sensibility, which manifests itself as an individual originality.
