Acid Mothers Temple (also: Acid Mothers Temple & the Melting Paraiso U.F.O., Acid Mothers Temple & The Cosmic Inferno (and subsequent offshoots) is a Japanese psychedelic band, the core of which formed in 1995. The band is led by guitarist Kawabata Makoto and early in their career featured many musicians, but by 2004 the line-up had coalesced with only a few core members and frequent guest vocalists.

The band has released albums frequently on a number of international record labels as well as the Acid Mothers Temple family record label, which was established in 1998 to document the activities of the whole collective. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Acid+Mothers+Temple">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
