Almost as enigmatic and mysterious as their sound, Bosse-de-Nage are a black metal band from the Bay Area. Drawing from the sonic sprawl of post-rock, the band crafts a sound that's as comfortable expanding outward as it is contracting into a suffocating mass of needling guitars and frantic drumming. The reclusive band released its self-titled debut (Bosse-de-Nage) in 2010 (though the album was recorded in 2007) through The Flenser before following up the next year with its second album, II. Bosse-de-Nage eventually got the attention of Profound Lore Records[/labe], which released their third offering, III, in 2012. Their fourth album, All Fours, was released in spring 2015. (The Flenser has continued releasing vinyl editions of Bosse-de-Nage's later albums.)

The band's name is taken from the novel Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician by Alfred Jarry, in which it is the name of a monkey. The narrator of the novel later wonders whether the monkey ever existed, or whether he merely hallucinated it. In addition to Jarry, the band has also cited Georges Bataille, Anaïs Nin, Pauline Réage, Comte de Lautréamont, and Charles Baudelaire as literary influences, and their lyrics have earned praise and comparisons to Pig Destroyer, Italo Calvino, and Jorge Luis Borges.

The band members only use initials on their releases, but two of their names are known through other sources.
