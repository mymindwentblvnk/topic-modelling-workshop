Formed in Montreal in late 2004, EMPATHY DENIED is a horde of four death metal lovers, among them Steven Henry (founder and ex-guitarist from Neuraxis) and Eric Fiset (ex-Obscene Crisis/ ex-Spirit of Vengeance vocalist, who appeared as a guest singer on Cryptopsy’s classic None so Vile) who teamed with ace bass player Daniel Daris (Demental /ex-Spirit of Vengeance) and drummer Yan Chamberland (ex-Obscene Crisis and Spirit of Vengeance) to assure the continuity of a concept then know under the moniker Lexiviat as well as properly exploiting Steven’s vast catalog of riffs, dating from all his previous involvements.

The concept is simple, the message is clear. Motivated by anger and rage, they strive to denounce the harm that selfish and greedy humans do to Nature, our suffering Earth and even themselves. EMPATHY DENIED members see the band as a therapy to extract and shout out loud their inner rage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Empathy+Denied">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
