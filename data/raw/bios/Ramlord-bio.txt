"I don't know whether these guys are THAT versatile or were just stoned outta their fucking MINDS when they put together all of this. Either way, it's golden. Seriously though, it's like Insect Warfare meets Dystopia meets early Darkthrone. Just overall innovative in every which way possible, making for one hell of a listening experience."
