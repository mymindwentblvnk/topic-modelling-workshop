Perpetual Never has a direction. That direction leads only one-way. The way to get there is through our passion for what we do. Focusing on melodic passages, technical hurdles, and a strong lyrical content, we express everything we are through are music. Live performances are intense at one moment and emotionally capturing at another. In the early spring of 2007, the band solidified as a three piece in order to jointly follow a dream and a goal. We have all come together and our ideas flow more fluidly than ever. The future holds something special. In the last few months, we have been constantly writing new music and a style seems to have been born that we are running with.... marketable, progressive rock. We love odd time signatures, key changes, and meter changes yet we do not forget the reason why music is created.... feeling.
