HYMNS is an alternative rock band formed in London in 2016. The line up consists of Oliver Hooper on vocals and guitar, Giorgio Compagnone on bass guitar and backing vocals, Matthew Ash on guitar and Amy Chapman on drums.
Drawing heavily from post-punk gone by, HYMNS create epic and ethereal songs that enlighten and uplift. Baritone vocals combined with hooky guitar riffs provide the foundation for music with melody and honesty at its heart.
The band recorded it’s debut release, The London EP, live at London’s Smokehouse Studios last year. The songs explore themes of isolation, desperation and hope in modern day city living; an honest commentary on our modern lives, and attempts to offer a pragmatic way forward.
They’re latest release sees the band focus on a more cinematic sound. ‘Let’s Take A Ride’ features dramatic strings, melodic guitar lines and baritone vocals that all come together to create a piece of apocalyptic psychedelia.
HYMNS are currently working on their next EP and will be playing some UK dates later in 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hymns">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
