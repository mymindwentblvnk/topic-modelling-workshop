The Six-Point Lead Project was born in the summer 2008 when Benny (Disarmonia Mundi, Dying Awkward Angel), Sergio (Art Of Darkness, Dying Awkward Angel), Cosimo (Broken Art, Dying Awkward Angel) and Claudio (Disarmonia Mundi) met each other to start up a new metal band, something more catchy and more aggressive than the bands they've been in before. In the following months the guys write down a bunch of raw tracks and new riffs and completed one of the best line-ups in the Turin area when Luca (Technophobia) joined the band in the late november 2008.
