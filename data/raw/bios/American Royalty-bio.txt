A never ending showdown of genres, American Royalty has been called everything from blues rock to electronic house. The Los Angeleno 3-piece has created quite a stir around the city with their unique sound and innovative take to the stage. The live show involves equal parts classic rock swagger and psychedelic genius with an electronic pulse. At the front of this musical hybrid are the power vocal leads and airy harmonies of frontmen Billy Scher and Marc Gilfry. While American Royalty's innovative sound may not be easily defined (they've been called "an impossible cross between The Black Keys and Boys Noize"), the unrelenting energy of their live set makes them a must see for any music fan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/American+Royalty">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
