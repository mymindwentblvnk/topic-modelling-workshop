Lisa O'Neill and Emma Anderson (ex-Lush), collectively known as Sing-Sing, released their second full length album Sing-Sing and I on July 11th, 2005. It draws on influences such as folk-rock, heavy metal hammer-ons, a bit of Motown drumming and just out-and-out indie-pop. The band toured extensively in North America and the songs are edgier, favouring guitars over the electronic samples that dominated debut album The Joy of Sing-Sing. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sing-Sing">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
