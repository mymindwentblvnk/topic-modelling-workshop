Classic Rock Magazine describes it:” …some very nice touches on Awkward Diary. Imagine Muse and Tool getting all cozy around Iced Earth and you’ve got the drift here. The musicianship is accomplished, the songs concise and focused.”

Ahoora, was formed late 2001, in Tehran, Iran. The influences were shown in the early covers: Iced Earth, Iron Maiden, and Black Sabbath ...etc. The band recorded its first demo tape “The Call of Beneath” back in 2004. In May 2005 Ahoora played its first official gig. 

February 13th 2006, saw the release of self titled debut album in Iran. Ultimate Metal called it "hard-hitting, true heavy metal “and The Metal Observer wrote “They are walking a very fine line, very fit on their instruments" while Chronicles of Chaos believed "Ahoora have clearly spent a lot of time honing their sound, both individually and as a unit, resulting in a coherent and tight album."

Ahoora’s 2nd album,”All in Blood with You”, came out on 30th of September 2007, which was a major step forwards in many ways. The album was received even warmer by metal & underground media. As Metal Mayhem named it as “…already one of the favorites of the year"”; Ultimate Metal called it “an incredible release that everyone should check out” while Progressive Rock&Metal described it as “A surprisingly quality metal masterpiece”.

“Awkward Diary”  was released on the 2nd of March 2010 by Zirzamin. Classic Rock Magazine describes the sound as "Muse and Tool getting all cozy around Iced Earth”, and Rock Pulse labeled it as: “highly impressive enigmatic, compelling progressive rock”.
