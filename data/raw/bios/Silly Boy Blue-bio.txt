Born in Italy, Denis (aka Silly Boy Blue), lived in a small village in the north. Suffocated by silence, he left Italy and moved to Spain after studying at university in Swansea - a city that inspired a couple of songs and as Dylan Thomas said, "is an ugly town".

In Italy, he studied at the Conservatory and graduated in flute. For several years he played in a number of chamber formations. Then the big bad world insisted he find a job. Graduating in economics his work took him to Spain. He soon realised the job was not for him. He lives in Valencia with his boyfriend.

With some free time he began to write, play and record his at home. In addition to the flute and the guitar Silly Boy Blue uses keyboards and loops, especially for drums and percussion.
Frustrated by a classical music education Silly Boy Blue now plays pop! “When you do not know what to call it, call it pop! You’re probably right!!”

At the moment Silly Boy Blue is a solitary band that hopes to play live at some point in the future.....
