"Full of depth, drone, deftly placed fractured wood-blocked underwater bass sound and a lot more besides. I’m not sure what you’d call it actually. It’s part post-dubstep; walls of reverb, sections of straight four four mixed with broken beats, strange ethereal Eastern markets and delicate pieces of sound. Some of you might class it as witchhouse, or as part of hauntology, something I don’t really know what is and what isn’t a statement that can also be applied to the post-dubstep term. At the most basic level this is experimental focused sound in a bass electronica context. Make of that what you will, but a listen is very much in order."
