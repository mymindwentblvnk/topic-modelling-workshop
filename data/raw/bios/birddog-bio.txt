Birddog was the alias of Americana singer/songwriter Bill Santen, a Lexington, KY native who spent several years drifting up and down the west coast before finally settling in Portland, OR. There he was befriended by local hero Elliott Smith, who agreed to produce the debut Birddog single "Killer" for the tiny Undercover label. Santen then signed to Chicago indie Sugar Free to release 1997's seven-song follow-up The Trackhouse, The Valley, The Liquor Store Drive-Thru; the full-length Ghost of the Season appeared a year later. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Birddog">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
