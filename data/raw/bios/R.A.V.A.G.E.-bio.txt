R.A.V.A.G.E was the name of the thrash/death metal band Atheist before they shortened it. It means "Raging Atheists Vowing A Gory End". The band made a self-produced demo titled "Rotting in Hell" With the line-up of:
Kelly Shaefer - Guitar/Vocals
Steve Flynn - Drums
Roger Patterson - Bass
In August 1985 they entered Progressive Studios in Tampa to record one song "Kill Or Be Killed" 
which was added to four other songs that were recorded live on a mixing desk due to a lack of money and that became the "Rotting In Hell" demo. 
Despite the rough sound, the tape did quite a bit to establish the band's name in the underground via the tape trading and fanzine networks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/R.A.V.A.G.E.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
