The project appeared in 2008 under the influence of melodic death and modern electronic-combined metal, however entwining with the original Realm Ex vision of music. Original purpose - drawing attention of the public at large to the Realm Ex music ideas - melodic art metal.
 
The name of the project reflects exquisite and refined melodic patterns so often associated with the traditional metal hardness. "Angelize" is the depth unfathomable and yet awe-inspiring to the listener as well as to the author himself.
 
Features a number of Ural metal signers: Vladimir Semenishev (Grave Flower), Dmitry "Diamond" Sosnov (Rose in Chaos), Irina Martchuk (The Silent Sky), Ekaterina Knyazkova, Juri Sakhnov (Molex). Lyrics by Pavel Terentev. Instrumental part, arrangement, composition, recording, mixing by Timofey Mineyev. The first album is called "Between Heaven and Earth" (2009).
