Eric Pellegrini is an American hard rock / heavy metal guitarist, songwriter, and producer.  Eric began playing at the age of 10, starting with rock bands like Nirvana, The Offspring, and Tool.  It wasn't long before he quickly jumped to the intense sounds of Slayer and At The Gates, learning every song that he could.  After playing high school talent shows so many times, he had decided by his late teens that it was time to start a band.  His first band called "Void Of Awakening" took the speed of Slayer and the guitar playing of At The Gates and meshed them together.  He got to play his first live show with V.O.A. and was fortunate enough to play many more with the same group.  After V.O.A. broke up, Eric formed a new band with new members called JLunt.  "JLunt was very different from V.O.A.  All the guys from JLunt had huge black metal influences which wasn't completely new to me but it was a genre that I never really followed until I started hanging out with those guys" says Eric.  He was also fortunate enough to play a few live shows with them before they broke up.  After a few years hiatus, Eric is back releasing his own material.  He is currently releasing his 3 song demo entitled, "Demo I (2011)" which are taken from his upcoming debut full length which will be released in the not to distant future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Pellegrini">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
