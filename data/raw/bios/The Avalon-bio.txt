After the demise of Plymouth band Aim for Grace in June 2008 band members Dan Broadley, Carl Jones and Ant Thornton joined with a new drummer Alex Young to form a new project, The Avalon, after only a few months Alex realised other commitments and so the guys once again joined with Aim For Grace drummer Dan Thornton to complete todays Avalon line up.
To date they have graced the stage with bands such as The Blackout, and will soon be touring the UK. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Avalon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
