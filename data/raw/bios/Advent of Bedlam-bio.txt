During nine years, the band has been established as one of the most important metal bands in costa rican scene, supporting giant bands as Amon Amarth, Behemoth, Fear Factory, Sepultura, Dismember, amongst others; plus two albums, both of them nominated to ACAM Awards for "Song writers of the year" in metal category, and awarded for their "Ablaze All Shrines" album, The band reached international exposure with a distribution deal with Relapse Records, and also with the appearance of "Manipulating Human Emotions" song in Zero Tolerance Magazine' covermount CD (February 2008).

Thanks to all this experience, the death metal group has decided to make a radical change in their image, and so they leave behind the name "December's Cold Winter" to be known as "Advent of Bedlam" from now on.

"We decided to make this change as the old name does not reflect the current lyrical and musical direction of the band after evolving our sound.

We have nine years of constant and professional work, so we know the best way to present Advent Of Bedlam is with a new album, we've been working on it since October 2008 and started recording in November 2009" Max.
