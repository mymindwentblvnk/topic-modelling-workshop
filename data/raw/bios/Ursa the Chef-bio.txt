’Rigatoni’, featuring Mick Jenkins , might be his first real glimpse of the public eye, but up-and-coming rapper Ursa the Chef has been hard at work for years. His debut mixtape ’Stick With Your People’ produced by Fishman!, was released exclusively on SoundCloud back in September 2016, but he’s been working on his craft since 2010. His debut single ‘History' showcased talent among fellow Chicago-area natives Saba, Cub-J, and Michael King, and landed him several opening acts on the East Coast for Post Malone.   In the two years that followed, he released several singles with producers Fishman! and Jab, including ‘Chef,’ ‘Boss,’ and ‘Champ.’ Following Rigatoni, Ursa is working on multiple projects and has music in the works with artists including theMIND and Brian Fresco. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ursa+the+Chef">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
