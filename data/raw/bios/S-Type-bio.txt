Producer from Scotland on LuckyMe Records...

S-Type, aka Bobby Perman, is 25 years old, hails from Edinburgh and now resides at the epicenter of Glasgow’s hallowed scene of electronic music that spawned careers for many of his friends and collaborators. As early as 2005 he was hanging-out, pooling-songs with Hud Mo, Mike Slott & The Blessings, fishing beats to rappers far overseas. But a pipedream by high teenagers has become a reality with a host of major label interest for S-Type production on 2013 rap projects (full details to be announced a$ap).

Raised in a family of jazz and rock musicians (most notably his elder brother Tommy leads experimental art-rock band FOUND), Bobby is a deft drummer and pianist who turned to the MPC2000 early; only to rise up the ranks of the Louis Den & Behind Closed Doors Beat-Battles. In the last few years his MPC lcd has been swapped for the all together wider scope of Logic and ProTools and one of the best new beatmakers has grown into one of the best new writers / arrangers. S-Type has mastered the anthemic top line, it bursts out of this ep, but as well as a lyrical ear his music has scope. At times close, taut and frenetic – screaming out for a Kendrick Lamar / Meek Mill verse – at others its wide, rich and so loud that one can’t fathom anyone doing the music justice.

The Billboard EP by S-Type contains 6 tracks that can out-knock any chat room of beatmakers, and knock-out any room chatter from A&Rs. It’s going to be interesting to see where this name ends up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/S-Type">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
