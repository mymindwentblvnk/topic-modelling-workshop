Dubmood is a crossgenre Swedish chipmusician living in Marseille who put out his first chiptunes on modarchive back in 1996. Since then he has been composing chipmusic for various crackgroups but residing with the infamous Razor 1911, described by the FBI as the oldest software piracy ring on the internet. 

Since 2004 he has been performing live, both as an Electro DJ and at Chipmusic livesets, alone and in different coalitions. Mentioned as a vital source of inspiration and the introduction to chipmusic by several emerging chiptune bands, Dubmood's presence in the chipmusic community is strongly felt. An old hand and a stylistic pioneer, Dubmood now not only earns respect from new  artists, but is also recognized by more well-known mainstream acts as an excellent producer and remixer.
