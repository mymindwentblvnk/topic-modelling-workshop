Forged with aggression, hatred and contempt, Eldergaad is on the rise, ready to unleash its rhetoric to a blind world being strip mined of its very soul and purpose by unfathomed corruption and evil. Stop cowering, you empty, hollow husks!! Stop believing in false prophets and promises and bow to the ELDERGAAD!!
