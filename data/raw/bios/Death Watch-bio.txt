Death Watch was formed in 2009 by Chuck Imisson (guitar/vocals), Al Crowe (bass) and Ryan Still (drums), following on from a jamming project between Chuck and Sean Bickerton in mid-2006. When Chuck moved to Aberdeen he met Al (Gods) through work and would chat about the kind of music theyâ€™d like to play in a band. Then, out of the blue, Crisp (Emeritus) came into HMV wearing a C.O.C. shirt, had a little chat with Chuck and disappeared for a while. After some emails getting sent and a few drinks, Death Watch started jamming and writing some good heavy shit and on Sunday, November 8th 2009, played their first gig at Drummonds in Aberdeen with Emeritus. Upon relocating to Aberdeen, the band was formed and began playing shows in Aberdeen with acts including Bonesaw, Element 106 and Eternal Idol. The band recorded their first demo, 'The Terror', and recruited second guitarist/vocalist, Neal Bonner. This 4-man incarnation continued until 2012 when Alastair and Ryan departed to focus on other projects.

Their places were taken by Doug Teago (bass) and Stefan Spark-Boylan (drums). In 2013, this lineup recorded the 2014 Fudge Award winning EP, 'Welcome to the Void', and supported touring acts Harvester, Headless Kross, Bast and Conan.

Neal left the band in 2014 and they have since continued as a 3-piece, combining elements of doom, death metal and hardcore to create their own brand of sludge. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+watch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
