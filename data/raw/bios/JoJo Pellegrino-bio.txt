JoJo Pellegrino (raised in Staten Island, New York) is an independent hip hop music artist.

His first two tracks to ever be heard were Fogedaboudid and Where I'm From. Fogetdaboudid subsequently became popular on local radio stations. He also appeared on the fictional radio station GameFM in the mega-hit video game Grand Theft Auto 3. In 2000, he inked his first major deal with Chris Lighty's management company Violator, which afterwards saw his long-awaited debut fall apart due to the folding of Violator's distributor, Loud Records. He later left Violator to become independent.

In 2002, he released a mixtape hosted by DJ Kay Slay, named Hitman For Hire. It was once awarded "Mixtape of The month" by MTV News. He recently got together with distributor Double Play to form Pellegrino Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/JoJo+Pellegrino">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
