Fresh on the back of their 2010 JD Set win which included a gig with iconic Aussie rockers 'Wolfmother' and a behind-the-scenes reality show on Chanel V, Sydney's New Navy are certainly on the brink of something special. Described by triple J’s Dom Alessio as “having a ton of potential, combining really well the sounds of Britain and the sounds of the U.S”, the young quartet draw influence from such great pop and indie acts as The Cure and Talking heads, combined with contemporary artists such as Vhs or Beta, Klaxons and The Editors. The ambitious band has received attention and praise for their ethereal and intimate live performances, sharing the stage with Australian heavyweights: Wolfmother, Dappled Cities, Philadelphia Grand Jury, Miami Horror and The Scare. Upon completion of their first recording, New Navy found success through the path of Triple J Unearthed, being plucked from thousands of hopefuls to be highlighted as a feature artist on the site and quickly reaching the number one position on the charts with their song, ‘Animals’. Recently reviewed by Triple J’s new breakfast host Tom Ballard as “A sure fire party hit”, the boys are set to embark on their newest journey- a four-track E.P. set for release in late 2010.

April the 20th, New Navy announced that they are splitting up. They are still releasing their debut album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/New+Navy">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
