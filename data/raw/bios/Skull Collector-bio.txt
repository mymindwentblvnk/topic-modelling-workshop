Biography

In 1996, after Omega splitted, Wouter Vloebergh (guitars) and Mark Van De Velde (drums) decided to continue with brutal death Metal. Everything had to be rebuild, they decided to develop their style based on the song 'Evil Spirit'. Some years followed, guitarists and vocalists came by, but none of them stayed with the band. Then in the year 2000 Bart De Wit (vocals) and David Ooms (bass) joined the band. This was the beginning of 'Skull Collector'. Skull Collector did some performances and a demo record (And then there was ...) followed in 2003. David Ooms decided to leave and due to lack of time Bart De Wit left the band as well, even though he's still active with the band and always prepared to help. Around that time Mark played in another band (Celebrant) as well, they were looking for a new vocalist and found Kurt Straetemans. Pierre (an ex Celebrant vocalist) returned and became again the lead vocalist of Celebrant. Mark used this opportunity to ask Kurt Straetemans to become the new vocalist of Skull Collector, and until now he's still our 'voice of sickness'. During all those events David Voorzanger joined the band, this guitarist is one that 'got stuck' and still plays the second guitar in Skull Collector. Some gigs followed and Skull Collector recorded their first full cd: 'Depravity Indulged Through Fresh Corporal Parts' (Label/Distro Rotten To the Core)
In august 2008 David Ooms rejoined the band.
