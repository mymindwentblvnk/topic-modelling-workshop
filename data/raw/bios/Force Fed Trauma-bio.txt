Force Fed Trauma (R.I.P) was formed in mid 2007 by a group of friends who mutually share a love for Death Metal. Upon their formation, within 4 months, 5 songs were written and two shows in and out of Auckland were played. Quickly turning heads within the metal/hardcore scene in Auckland, Force Fed Trauma have gained much respect from their peers and have quickly become noted for their intense live sets, anti-Christian, violent lyrical content and their stamp on the popular ‘deathcore’ genre. In late March 2008, Force Fed Trauma entered the studio to record their 5 track debut E.P entitled “A Stream of Rotting Cadavers” with Alex Bird (In Dread Response) and Ross McDougall (Antagonist), which was released on November 15th.

In December 2008, Josh VC (vocals) decided he would be quitting the band.
The other 4 members collectively decided not to continue Force Fed Trauma without Josh VC. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Force+Fed+Trauma">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
