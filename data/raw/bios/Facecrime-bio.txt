1) facecrime was an 80s power pop band from Edmonton, Canada. Before moving to Toronto, Moe Berg (also MODERN MINDS) played in facecrime, then he formed another great power pop band - The Pursuit Of Happiness. Facecrime released only Sex & Revolution EP in 1984.

2) Formerly known as 'Pete Woolliscroft and the Drum and Bass Sisters', Facecrime consists of Jack William Wall on drums, Robert Hallam on Bass, Peter Jones on lead guitar and vocals and Josh Woolliscrft on rythm guitar and vocals. The band is still yet to play its first 'real' gig but has performed to a number of drunken friends with an intimate and accoustic set at one of many of the parties at Corft House, Newton Solney.
The band has recorded a number of low quality demos to date, including the ever popular 'wooly', 'pete's one' and new favourite 'cappo song'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Facecrime">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
