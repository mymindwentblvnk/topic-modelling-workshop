Santiano is a German band from the Flensburg area founded in 2011. They mix several genres like traditional folk songs, German schlager music, Irish folk and shantys. The band's name derives from the shanty "Santiano", also known as "O Santianna (All on the Plains of Mexico)", which has been a hit in 1961 sung by French singer Hugues Aufray. 
The producer and owner of the label Elephant Music Hartmut Krech from Flensburg came up with the idea for the band. On February 3rd 2012 they released their first CD "Bis ans Ende der Welt" (Until the end of the world) on "We Love Music", a cooperation of Universal Music and ProSiebenSat.1 Media. Their album has sold more than 100.000 times and has gold status in Germany.
In 2012 they played at world famous metal festival "Wacken Open Air" among several metal bands like In Flames, The Scorpions, Ensiferum or Amon Amarth.
