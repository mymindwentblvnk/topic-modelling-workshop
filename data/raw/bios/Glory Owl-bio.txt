Glory Owl is a five piece stoner-metal combo based in Trieste, Italy. Formed in early 2012, the band shortly put up a convincing setlist for their live appearances and two promo songs home produced -The sky is black now; Trainwreck- the latter being published in Kornalcielo Records' compilation: Trieste Rock City.

The band hit the studio during summer 2013 to record their first, self titled, EP, which was released in digital format on October 25th 2013 and is available at Bandcamp.

Glory Owl is Gian (voice), Papa (bass, backing v), Moka (guitar, backing v), Toni (guitar) and Tenagliato (drums).

The band is currently unsigned and searching for a label.
