Gods Second Son is a Band started by a few Germans and One American. The American Frederick Melott left Germany in 2006 due to the failing economy. If the Jobs situation would have been better Fred would have stayed. Gods Second Son is still Driving on this day and continues to ahhhhhhhhh Crowds with its Great Music.
