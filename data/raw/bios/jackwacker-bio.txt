JACKWACKER - "...things from inside your body" (LP)
label: blackvelvetfuckererecordings

13 years after the fact, JACKWACKER's recorded remains have finally been excavated for your ears.

Jackwacker crawled out of the bleak bubble of early 90s Bloomington followed by a short lived relocation to Madison, Wisconsin, where they soon dissolved. Thriving briefly as outsiders of the Midwest No-Wave hula bahloo, they shared bills amongst folks like Couch, Duotron, the Scissor Girls, The Flying Luttenbachers, To Live and Shave in L.A., Zerobot and Lake of Dracula. Elijah Prichett sang and played a guitar strung with 3 bass strings and 3 guitar strings. Rob Stockwell played drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jackwacker">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
