We are incranium, a heavy/thrash metal band from the depths of Stockholm, sweden.
We started out in August 2006 by the initiative of Tony, Micke and Tintin.
About a month later David joined the band and it wasn't until September 2007 that The Moe signed up.

During the first year we focused mainly on getting our sound sorted, making songs together to record our first demo.
The song 'Road To Devastation' was also picked out to be depicted with a music video recorded and produced by Total Design Producer Art Studios.
The first demo 'stay awake' was released about a year later in the summer of 2007.

We bring it fast, heavy and aggressive! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Incranium">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
