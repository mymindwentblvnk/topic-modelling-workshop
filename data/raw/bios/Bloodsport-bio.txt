Bloodsport was an important, albeit lesser known, Chicago punk band in the mid-80s. Unfortunately, Bloodsport is most well known for the bands that the members were in before or after the band. They released one EP in 1985 and continued to play live until most of their members joined The Effigies in 1987.
  Line up:
    *  Dave Bergeron - Vocals
    * Chris Bjorklund - Guitar/Vocals
    * Tom Woods - Bass/Vocals
    * Joe Haggerty - Drums

Growing up in Adelaide's hardcore scene, it's hard not to become overwhelmed. With amazing bands such as Embodiment 12:14, I Killed The Prom Queen, Shotpointblank and Day of Contempt leading the way, following in their footsteps can be a little daunting. Four friends came together and decided to take up the challenge and the result is BLOODSPORT - passionate, ferocious, message filled hardcore that hits harder than a fist to the jaw.

With lyrics relating to Spiritual Warfare, friendship and overcoming the hard times, bloodsport is a band that every hardcore kid can relate to. With the release of their 2006 demo and there debut album 'Imprisonment' out now in New Zealand and out in Australia on April 26th 2008 through Skull and Bones records / Stomp Distribution, BLOODSPORT are going from strength to strength. So come to a show, sing along and have a mosh - there's always room for one more in this family.

Line up:
Levi - vocals
Knotty - guitar
Dan - bass
Joel - drums

Bloodsport is the sound of one electronic producer. Soundscapes of echoing synths and reverbing guitar, backed by downtempo hiphop beats.
