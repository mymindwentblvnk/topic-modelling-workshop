Belfry (Metal) - Blackend/Thrashed Power Metal from DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany
Belfry (Dungeon Synth) - Huntsville, Alabama. https://belfryburn.bandcamp.com

Belfry had it's birth in 2003 and went through a greater development in  their musical style, which means their songs became faster, harder and more blasting. Their female singer is supported by screams and grunts from the other members.
While serveral people compared their newer songs to bands like Within Temptation and The Gathering, they insist on their own style. That implies: No keyboards! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Belfry">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
