Yhdarl was formed as a one man band, by Déhà (Deviant Messiah, Merda Mundi, Khel, Slow) between Suicidal/Funeral Black/Doom with Drone/Noise influences. Formed in winter 2006-2007, Yhdarl drowns its influences from drone/doom (gravetemple, sunn o))), black boned angel, ...), extreme slow doom (corrupted, monarch!, khanate, ...), depressive/suicidal black metal (shining, hypothermia, trist, ...) and many other musics. It has two very special sides : the 'pure' Yhdarl sound, which can be heard on the "Humainly Sick" album, or some drone/noise/dark ambiant influenced music, like the "Ø" and "Ø²" EPs. In 2009, Yhdarl made up as a duo with Abalonka, helping on vocals, bass ans composition duties. Yet, months later, due to schedule problems, Yhdarl came back as a one man band, with the true concept of inviting many people as guests, like Cadavre (Grimlair), .selv. (Kaldt, Ahbiss), Abalonka, Schabe, and more.
