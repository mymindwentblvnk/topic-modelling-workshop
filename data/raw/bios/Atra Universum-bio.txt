From the darkest shadows of the universe hails a deadly melodic force unleashing an audible vengeance upon the world. It arrives in the name of Atra Universum. The soldiers chosen to carry out the dark artistry within are, Chris Koenig, Greg Koenig, and R.Jurgen. Written, Recorded, Produced and mixed themselves, allows for a broad range of creativity on the interior of the music and highlights portions of the individuals which are revealed in time. The process begins with something simple, a riff or a drum beat and then layered with all the elements needed to deliver a worthy presentation of material. Their first offering was Bloodlust Symphony, an aggressive, majestic onslaught cast out of their own studio, that embraced much of where they come from and the viewpoints they possess. The origin of this collaboration began circa 1997 when brothers Chris and Greg started to write material together with long time friend R.Jurgen. Music being a huge influence on their lives in many ways brought on a necessity to create their own songs and contribute to the entire process of what became Atra Universum. Through the years many projects and songs have been written and dissected until the desired goal was reached. Focus is put on substance in the music and inner feeling when writing material leading to growth and expansion on what is ultimately created. The second offering is a direct descendent of that growth in the height of the songwriting process so far. This self titled overture of evil brings some new musical view points to the dark world of metal and continues to expand on the course set forth by the creators, Atra Universum
