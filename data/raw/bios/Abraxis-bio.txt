2. ABRAXIS was an instrumental fusion band from Bruxelles formed in 1976. The group featured musicians from other bands active in the same area in their heyday, like COS (namely keyboardist Charles LOOS and bassist Jean-Paul MUSETTE), and bands like PAZOP, WATERLOO and PLACEBO, which played in a similar fashion of jazz and Canterbury prog rock inspired music. Their only album can be recommended to fans of that 70's jazz rock style of the bands mentioned. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abraxis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
