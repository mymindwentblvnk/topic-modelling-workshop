Approximately three years ago (2004) Jussi.T, Matti.A and Matti.H started playing together Metallica's songs. After playing for a while together their playing and songmaking skills were enough to make and play some own songs. Riikka.R came to fill vocalists place in 2006 and Lauri.J as a bassist in 2007 after a long time without bassing/bass playing. Now they are creating their own style slowly and making songs.

Their music is kind of a mixature between bands Kotiteollisuus, Mokoma, Apulanta and vocals performed in english. Heavy riffs, beautiful female vocals and anxious feeling within songs.

Perish is a powerful doom/stoner style rock and roll quartet from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With a "whatever we write is us" attitude towards songwriting, the band's material tends to differ vastly; though solid walls of distortion and roaring riffs are a mainstay on most songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Perish">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
