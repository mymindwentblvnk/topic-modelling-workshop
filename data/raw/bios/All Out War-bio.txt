All Out War was formed in the summer of 1991 by Tom Connelly, Sam Carbone, Chris Bozeth and Mike Score though the band first started playing shows consistently with Tom Connelly, Erik Carrillo, Jim Antonelli, Chris Chisholm and Mike Score. Most of the material on All Out War's first two releases were written by this line up. Mike Score, Erik Carrillo, and occasionally Jim Antonelli still play shows and release material. The band has a new cd coming out called Into the Killing Fields. It will be released August 3 on Victory Records. www.alloutwar.bigcartel.com

All Out War has made stops at such legendary clubs as CBGS's and Lamours in New York City, The Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey, and The Rat in Boston as well as opened for bands as diverse as Deicide, Agnostic Front , Napalm Death, Earth Crisis, Sick Of It All, Malevolent Creation, Biohazard, Type O Negative, Cro-Mags , Madball, and Life of Agony to name a few. All Out War is comfortable in many circles. The five piece has not only crossed over and spit in the faces of the closed minded, but has been accepted unconditionally both by the metal crowd and the hardcore crowd alike. This feat has been attempted countless times, but has rarely acheived the success that All Out War has.
