"Human, the only animal on earth that chooses to hate it's own existence. Blind, the parasite wanders freely on the planet. Betraying, poisoning and  finally killing everything it touches. He does what he wants…but doesn't want what he does. Gifted with beautiful intelligence, he only uses it for his own benefit, robing his brothers, humiliating his fathers…legacy of greed and pain has turned him into the virus of this Eon, but time runs out, and Mother Nature will organize the board to checkmate her worst player. The sad creature, makes up names and worship gods to hide himself, and with his serpent eyes he silently  awaits the gods forgiveness. This way, the architecture of Chaos, justifies his arrogant ending. But then, extremely irritated and blinded by fury, a misanthropic clan is born,  baptized with the name AisthesiS, with only one purpose: Spit on your face human beast, preach hatred in front of you.  Join or step a side,  because options and time has run out. To many days, to much grief, to much fear, to much blood have you sawed. We warned you, we annunciate it…THE EON OF WRATH is unleashed and there is no turning back." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aisthesis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
