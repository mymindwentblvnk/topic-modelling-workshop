Sigyn was founded in 2009, when two young metal heads, Jarmo and Markus, met each other. Quite soon they started to make music together. When Markus went to Vaskivuori Music High School, he met Jere, Eetu and Aki. Pieces locked up in to their places, and Sigyn decided to make a demo from the songs that Jarmo and Markus had made earlier. Sigyn is a tight group of young musicans, with loads of ethusiasm of youth! Beware, there is more to come.... *evil laugh* 

The first demo/EP called "Cursed" is set be released in 20th June 2010.

The line-up:
Markus Suomela - Lead Guitars and vocals
Eetu "Moppi" Ikonen - Lead Guitars
Jarmo JÃ¤rvi - Keyboards
Jere "Jekku" Tuominen - Bass and backing vocals
Aki Saastamoinen - Drums <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sigyn">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
