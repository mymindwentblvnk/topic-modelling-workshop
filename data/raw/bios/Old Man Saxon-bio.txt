Old Man Saxon, aka Saxon Kincy, started rapping as an eleven-year-old at Denver's Smiley Middle School. "I would rap-battle at lunch," he remembers. "I was relatively quiet, but I saw the attention that I got being able to put words together. Eventually it grew into not doing it for attention, but because I found some sort of peace in it."

After graduating from the University of Colorado Boulder, he moved to Los Angeles and has been making music professionally for about eight years. Nonetheless, he spent most of 2014 living out of his car â€” but he used his experience with homelessness as inspiration for his first official EP, Perils.

Before recently moving back to Colorado, Kincy was a professor of rap at the Musicians Institute in L.A. His boss there, Debra Byrd, had been a voice coach for several television programs, and told him about Rhythm + Flow.

Kincy says the show was a welcome opportunity to grow his fan base. "For me, it's always been about making music and music videos, and the common theme for everyone that would comment on my videos was, 'Man, this should have more attention, I don't see how you don't have more views,'" he explains. "And I'm not good at promoting, doing those extroverted things that you need to do to succeed as a rapper. I would make my music, go to my room and just see what happened. So I feel like this was a way for me to bring more attention to what I make." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Old+Man+Saxon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
