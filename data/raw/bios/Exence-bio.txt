Formed in 2000 under the name Essence in Italy (Florence, Tuscany). The last lineup under this name consisted Massimiliano Pasciuto (Vocals), Federico Puleri on Guitar from Vision Divine, SevenGates, Mirko Serra on Bass (Onyricon, Frozen Tears) and Francesco Brizzi on Drums (Holyland). They released a self-producted demo called Dynamics in 2005, but they remained unsigned for many years. In 2008 they changed their name to Exence. In the next year, after 16 months in studio, they released their first album, entitled Hystrionic on Punishment 18 records. Hystrionic has a lot of Death influences (for example the song Symbolic Act is a tribute medley of "Symbolic" and "Flesh and the power it holds" dedicated to Chuck Schuldiner), however it is remained progressive thrash as well.
