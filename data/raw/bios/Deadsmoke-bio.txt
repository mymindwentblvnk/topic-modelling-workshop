Deadsmoke is an Italian doom sludge band that sounds like amplifiers buried in the deep, with down-tuned monolithic guitar riff scraping the soil down to the core of the earth.
Slow, hypnotic, dissonant cadences recall the eternal need for isolation and the atavistic fear of nothingness.
Your soul is already burned, smoke is what remains.

Matteo - Guitars
Maurice - Drums
Gianmaria - Bass
