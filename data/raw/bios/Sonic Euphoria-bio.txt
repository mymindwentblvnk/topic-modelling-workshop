From Adelaide, South Australia, Sonic Euphoria started in late 2006 out as a 5 piece hardcore/metal band til early-mid 08 they decided their current singer is not what they wanted for their new direction so they recruited new singer Julien to sing for the band. they had written new material in the new direction they had in mind which turned out to be a mixture of progressive and death metal and later played gigs with metal core bands to make enough money to independently release a 5 track EP title The Loss

1. Thus it begins [4.20]
2. Frailty [5.12]
3. Memoirs Of The Lost [3.45]
