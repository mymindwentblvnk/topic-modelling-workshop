From their MySpace:
"Sometimes, looking to the seaside from my Castle I can see fleets of submarines bombing the stars. Slowly the color of the Moon changes from purple to white, illuminating all the night of a pure light. During these nights, the deers, as usual, come out of their lairs looking for some food. Red frogs jump from tree to tree singing songs of death, while a man is vomiting on the head of his wife after seeing a star falling into the sea. When it rains, here in Rapuge, cows start to howl, calling for some grass to eat and some people to talk with. At 2.22 a.m. I turn my look to the East, staring at the end of the sea, thinking about its multiple colors, from yellow, to green. Slowly, when the bombing stops, I go down the wooden Castle's stairs, sitting in the metro hall waiting for my train. Yes, it's coming fast as a swallow, killing the frost it finds along the railroad. I've lost my silver key so I don't know when I'll come back here, my Castle. Outside it's raining a rain of copper, making happy all Rapuge's bell towers." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blue+Deers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
