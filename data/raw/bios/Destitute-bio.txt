Foxcore/Punk band from Portland, Oregon.

Destitute was formed when sisters Ali & Violet met Daniel in 2006. Although they all had different musical tastes, they all shared a love of one thing, making music. Their heartfelt lyrics and very convincing screams are backed by either raw punk riffs and fast drums or almost haunting melodies. Both girls take turns confessing tales about lost loves, drugs, betrayal, social issues and the need for gender equality. After a year off for personal reasons, Ali & Violet are back with their demo titled 'Left for Dead' to be released in early 2010 on Unrepentant Records.
