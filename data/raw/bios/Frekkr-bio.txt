Frekkr is a viking black metal project founded by Loki and Vanargand. Frekkr means bold, or valiant in the old Germanic language, and is the origin of the word "Frank". For the first album, the lyrics are the French translation of the Voluspa from the Poetic Edda, but in a second time they will be in relation with the Völkerwanderung and more precisely Frankish people. Frekkr is now looking for a label and musicians to play gigs.
