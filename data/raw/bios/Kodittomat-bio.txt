Koski Tl, Finland (2008 - present)

Kodittomat (originally Joni-Miikka & Kodittomat) is a Finnish thrash metal band formed in Koski Tl, Finland in 2008. The band consists of Vilpertti "Dilppu" Salminen (guitars, vocals), Joni-Miikka "Jay" Merilahti (guitars), Niko "Nipsu" Muurinen (bass) and Petri "Pete" Kyynäräinen (drums). In the very beginning the band had a problem with choosing their name but soon they decided to choose Joni-Miikka & Kodittomat as their name, which origin was on some "horribly bad joke". Later on they simplified their name and dropped Joni-Miikka off. Kodittomat is a Finnish word which means "homeless people" in English.

The band has taken influences from Metallica, Pantera, Slayer, Sepultura and Children of Bodom. In the beginning they mainly played covers but soon started producing their own stuff. Kodittomat's first EP "Kodittomat" was released in autumn 2009 including two tracks "Time Before I Had Gone" and "Chaser". In 2010 the band released their second EP entitled "Forget the People" including three new tracks and the remastered versions of previously released tracks. Tomi Färm has been the producer for both EPs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kodittomat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
