JEREMIAH KANE, often abbreviated JK, is a Polish electronic metal band based in Poznań, Poland. Formed in 2017, the band currently consists of guitarists and keyboardists Jeremiah Kane and Vincent Kane. Their eclectic musical style combines influences from rock and metal music genres with those from vintage electronic music genres and video games.

JEREMIAH KANE started in 2017, first as a solo project of Jeremiah Kane, who played previously in various metal bands and who took interest in retro electronic music and synthesizers. On May 25, 2017, he released his debut EP, Neoangeles, and the debut album, The New Dawn, on November 15, 2017.

Vincy Kane, a childhood friend and previous bandmate of Jeremiah, joined the band in 2018, first as a live guitarist and later, as a full member. JEREMIAH KANE released their 2nd album, All or Nothing, on October 25, 2018. The album quickly gained attention in the Synthwave music community and was considered a major breakthrough for their career, cited as one of the best Synthwave albums in 2018.

In 2020, JEREMIAH KANE announced that they will work with a German music producer, Kristian “Kohle” Kohlmannslehner to work on their future material. This cooperation led to the release of the single, Never Back Down, on the 6th of March, 2020. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/JEREMIAH+KANE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
