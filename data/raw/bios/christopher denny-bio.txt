Christopher Denny (...) is the oldest twenty-two year old on the planet. He seems to have come of age sometime in the '30s or '40s, in the numberless dusty small towns and on the single-lane highways of the American interior, in the company of an itinerant cohort of men whose shoes were soled with cardboard but whose hearts were tender, and who were buoyed along in the margins of society by bad times and good love and the ability to turn all it into a song.
