The summer of 2007 marks the end of the successful Rotterdam (the Netherlands) metalcore formation Dead By Dawn. A few members plan to form a new band: a brutal, yet melodic metal band. 
Guitarist Wouter Florusse and vocalist Richard de Neve recruit producer/ songwriter Dennis Moerkerk as lead guitarist. Later, drummer Frank Debij (Acrid; ex-Cypher) and bassplayer Martine Sipma (ex-Deleterious) make the band complete.

The first songs define the musical style: thrash metal as in its glory-days, entwined with elements of melodic death metal. The music is characterised by a balanced variation between loud and gentle and there’s certainly no aversion to breaks and tempo changes. The band develop their own modern and recognisable sound. The lyrics deal with the horrors and heroes of World War II.

In 2009 The Dead Normality reaches second place in the national Metal Battle band competition. Their debut release comes out October the same year: the EP ‘Killing Reality’, which consists of five tracks. Produced by Dennis Moerkerk and incorporating artwork by Wouter Florusse, the EP receives good critiques both in Holland and abroad. 

With a tight and rocking live show The Dead Normality plays gigs everywhere in and outside of the country. Led by a brutal vocalist, envied by many metal singers, the band will leave venues behind as smoking ruins. Resistance is futile: the place will be wrecked as the audience will go berserk. Horns up!
