Raw and honest; that’s how the recordings of “Unravel”, Delphian’s second album, can best be decribed. The band went for the recording-takes which had the best feel and flow, which led to a grooving and heavy album. 

The dutch quintet Delphian was founded in the beginning of this century by guitarist Coert Bouten and drummer Roel van Helden (also in the band Sun Caged). After a long search and a dozen musicians, the current line-up was finally completed in the summer of 2003. 

The first demoCD (2004) got a lot of positive reviews and made a deal possible with the Finnish label Lion Music. The debut album “Oracle” was released in july 2005. While the second album “Unravel” saw the light in april 2007. 

The style of Delphian has evolved from progressive metal in the earlier recordings to a heavy kind of rock on the latest album “Unravel”. From heavy 7-string thrashy songs like “Starting to Unravel” to an epic 10+ minute semiballad “Air”. All completed with dramatic, emotional lyrics and vocals by female singer Aniek Janssen. Reviewers speak of a non-comparable unique sound, consisting of dynamic and creative rhythms combined with melodic guitar riffs and crystal clear vocals and flute playing. ..
