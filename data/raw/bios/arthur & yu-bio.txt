Arthur & Yu is an American indie folk duo from Seattle, Washington. 

Comprised of Grant Olsen and Sonya Westcott, Arthur & Yu first album In Camera is an audible effigy of a time past, and an album made for forgetting and remembering. 

Drawing sonic inspiration from the Velvet Underground as well as the studio experimentation of Lee Hazlewood, each track is a study in expansion, centered loosely around chiming guitars and swirling melodies. Olsenâ€™s hazy croon is lifted by the smooth harmonies of Westcott, and both reel in the influence of Nancy Sinatra between the familiar crash of a tambourine and layers of guitar. Cascading and building, the final result is the sound of a band realizing itself, or perhaps just growing up a bit. Built upon nostalgia and exuding a certain warmth that is undeniably earnest, In Camera is their debut, and the first release for Hardly Art. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arthur+&+Yu">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
