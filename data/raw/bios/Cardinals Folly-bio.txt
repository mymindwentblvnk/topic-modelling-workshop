Cardinals Folly is a doom metal band from Helsinki, Finland that used to be called The Coven. In 2008 they released an EP titled 'Heretic's Hangover' followed by another EP 'Orthodox Faces' in 2009 which showed huge potential and made them easily one of the best new bands to emerge from the doom metal scene of that year. Fastforward a couple of years and they put out a 69 minute full-length debut album that delivered more than anyone could have ever hoped for. Supported by a great high quality label, Shadow Kingdom, this band should be and deserves to be huge in the doom underground. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cardinals+Folly">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
