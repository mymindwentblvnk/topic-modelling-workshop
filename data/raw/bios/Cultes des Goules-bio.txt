About the Band CULTES DES GOULES

CULTES DES GOULES started out as a one-man-project beginning 2007 and plays music with distorted basses and scary or orchestral arrangements. Since 2009 the band concentrates more and more on experiments - distortion is going more into the background. Lyrics are heavily inspired by the wellknown authors H.P.Lovecraft, Edgar Allen Poe and other writers of weird literature from the 19th and 20th century.

History of CULTES DES GOULES

Originally formed as DOMINATION in 1999 the band played a few gigs but split up without ever making a recording (except for one rehearsal, a tape which nobody has seen for several years). Now, with his former band THARGOS laid to rest, Cy Ghul decided to follow his own musical path under the new name CULTES DES GOULES. He started with writing some gothic music, but he soon felt that he was just able to do something with distortion. As a fan of Barathrum, Necromantia and other, bass-oriented Acts he used more and more basses. At the end he released two demos in short time, „ARISE“ and „PURGATORY“.

In 2008 BARBARIAN WRATH decided to release the debut full length album of CULTES DES GOULES. But then the label decided to have a short break. Cy Ghul founded GHUL PRODUCTIONS then where he releases his music. The debut THE HOUSE AT THE WATER has been released on halloween 2008.

At Halloween 2009 the new album THE STORY OF DAGON appeared. It can be also heard on Last.FM. A free download is available on the artists homepage. Even a physical book is available, containing the CD-R, the original Lovecraft story and lots of background material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cultes+Des+Goules">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
