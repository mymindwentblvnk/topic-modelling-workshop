William Bell (born 16 July 1939) is an American soul singer and songwriter. As a performer, he is probably best known for his debut single 1961's "You Don't Miss Your Water" and 1968's top 10 hit in the UK "Private Number", a duet with Judy Clay.

One of the finest of the Stax/Volt soul artists, he was, like Otis Redding, able to tell a story with great sincerity and  flawless musicality.  His song "You Don't Miss Your Water ('Til Your Well Runs Dry)" is a Memphis masterpiece.             <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/William+Bell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
