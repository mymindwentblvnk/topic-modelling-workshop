There are several artists using the name "Black Blood".

Black Blood was an afrobeat/funk/soul/disco outfit formed by expatriate African musicians in Brussels, Belgium in the mid-70's. They performed in local clubs, were sighted by a record label executive, cut a few singles and LPs (1975's Chicano arguably being their strongest work) and appear to have vanished into thin air afterwards.
