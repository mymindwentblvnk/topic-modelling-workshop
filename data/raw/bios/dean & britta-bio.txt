Dean & Britta is a musical duo consisting of Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips, both former members of Luna. Wareham had formed Luna in 1992 after leaving his first band, Galaxie 500. Phillips joined Luna in 2000, replacing bassist Justin Harwood. 

Their first album started out as a Wareham solo project, but when he heard Phillips' demos, he asked her to join him. 'L'Avventura' was produced by Tony Visconti - and was released on Jetset Records in 2003 under the name 'Britta Phillips & Dean Wareham'. 

After Luna broke up in 2005, Dean & Britta spent the next year working on film scores (most notably Noah Baumbach's movie, 'The Squid and the Whale'), and promoting the documentary film of Luna's farewell tour 'Tell Me Do You Miss Me'. They were married during the recording of their album 'Back Numbers' (also produced by Tony Visconti), and simplified their name to 'Dean & Britta'. Back Numbers was released on Rounder Records in February 2007 followed by a limited edition EP, "Words You Used To Say".

In 2008, Dean & Britta covered The Cure's 'Friday I'm in Love' for American Laundromat Records tribute compilation 'Just Like Heaven - A Tribute to The Cure'. The duo's most recent release '13 Most Beautiful… Songs for Andy Warhol’s Screen Tests'  followed in 2009.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dean+&+Britta">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
