Morten J. Olsen -­ drums & SuperCollider3
Anders Hana -­ guitar & keyboard.

MoHa! play somewhat loud music influenced by incredibly varied sources. Some say the duo deal in sonic splatter, in a brew of improvisation, noise, computer music and probably some more. Others say it is reminiscent of the conversation your mate has at you on the weekend in a club when he’s had too much to drink and is telling you how great everything is at 100mph. Only instead of your mate it is actually R2D2, which leads you to believe maybe that someone did put something in your drink. In any case it is the work of two young men from Norway currently residing in Berlin. Anders Hana  on guitar, keyboard and a pallete of effect pedals, and Morten J. Olsen on drums and processed drums triggering a multitude of noises from each skin and cymbal. Formed as a live project, their shows are a challenge to describe, and very hard to categorize. A broad spectrum of sounds and silences. Two sides both compliment and confront each other, with sharp and mechanical movements on one, free flowing and unconstrained gestures on the other. And, oh yeah, they changed quite a bit, now they play songs!
