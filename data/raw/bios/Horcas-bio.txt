Horcas is a heavy metal band from Argentina  created in 1988 by Osvaldo Civile, former guitarist for V8, Argentina’s landmark heavy metal outfit in the 1980s. After quitting V8 in 1985, and impressed by the new generation of thrash metal bands from the Bay Area led by Metallica, Civile set out to put together a new group in that line. That seminal project, which included former V8 bandmate Gustavo Rowek on the drums, was however delayed for a number of reasons, and it was not until 1988 that it could definitely take off. By that time though, put off by the incessant postponements, Rowek had joined another former V8 member, Walter Giardino, in his new project Rata Blanca.

1988-1990 - Reinará la Tempestad

The first version of Horcas to hit the road had Civile on lead guitar, Adrián Zucchi on rhythm, Eddie Walker on the bass, Gabriel Ganzo on drums and Hugo Benítez on vocals. The band quickly garnered recognition in the local heavy metal circles, mainly because of Civile’s past as a V8 member, but also because they were among the first in Argentina to explore a more extreme line within the genre. In 1990, Horcas landed their first recording deal with indie label Radio Trípoli, and as a quartet, since Zucchi had left the band, cut their first album Reinará la Tempestad.

1991-1996 - Oíd Mortales el Grito Sangrado

In 1991, bassist Eddie Walker leaves the band and is replaced by current member Norberto “Topo” Yáñez, while the rhythm guitar slot is filled by Oscar Castro. With this line-up they release in 1992 their second effort Oíd Mortales el Grito Sangrado ("Hear, oh mortals, the bleeding cry", a twist to the opening line of the Argentine Anthem: "Oíd mortales el grito sagrado" -"Hear, oh mortals, the sacred cry"-). This album, which includes the all-time fan favourite Solución Suicida, broadened the band’s fanbase and seemed to predict a major breakthrough for Horcas in the near future. In fact, during 1993, the band was chosen to open for Metallica, Motörhead, Kreator and Exodus on their Argentinian dates. However, there were soon to be internal frictions, which ended up in Civile firing all of the band members except for bassist Topo Yáñez, in less than a year. This situation, which forced Civile to re-form the band almost from scratch, together with major problems with their label, which prevented Horcas from recording during 5 years, seriously hampered the band’s growth.

1997-1999 - Vence - Eternos - Civile's death

However, Civile continued with Horcas against all odds. This fact, along with the devotion his persona inspired in the local heavy metal fanbase, opened the band a new window of opportunity in 1997, when with a new line-up which included current members Sebastián Coria on guitar, Guillermo De Luca on drums and the charismatic Walter Meza on vocals, Horcas were able to finally record their long-awaited third album Vence. The album, which yielded the classic Argentina, Tus Hijos - also to be the band's first video clip - was acclaimed by critics and fans alike, and Horcas were once again on their feet. 1997 and 1998 were extremely successful years for Horcas during which the band expanded dramatically their fanbase and finally established themselves as one of the leading Argentinian and Latin American heavy metal acts. At that time Civile is quoted as saying that after 7 years he had finally put together the band he had strived so many years for.

At the beginning of 1999, Horcas returned to the studio to cut its fourth album Eternos, which was to become Civile’s last recording. On April 24, 1999 Civile played for the last time with Horcas. Five days later, on April 29 he was found shot dead in his home. The cause of his death was ultimately never clarified, though speculation points to suicide, since Civile had a long history of alcohol addiction and was said to be prone to depressive attacks.

1999-2003 - Horcas - Vive

The remaining band members were then faced with the dilemma of continuing with the band or not. Finally it was decided that Horcas would continue as a tribute to Civile. The band then enlisted guitarist Gabriel Lis and went on their first international tour that included Mexico, Bolivia, Uruguay and Brazil to promote Eternos.

In 2002 Horcas are signed by indie label El Pie Records and record their fifth studio album, the first without Osvaldo Civile. The album called simply Horcas is extremely well received both by critics and fans and yields instant classics such as the songs Esperanza and Reacción. The next year, the band release their first live album Vive, recorded on September 13, 2003 during a sold-out gig at Hangar in Buenos Aires.

2004-2006 - Demencial

2004 will be a turning point in Horcas’ career. The year begins with the band opening for Iron Maiden at Vélez Sarsfield stadium in Buenos Aires for an audience of 40,000. Shortly after, they change management and touring becomes more extensive on a national scale and begins to include international dates on a normal basis. On November 18, 2004, Horcas release Demencial, their final album for El Pie Records. The album, which inaugurates an era of experimentation for the band, in which they work with lower tunings and new sounds, received excellent reviews from the critics and a mixed reaction from their fanbase, who notwithstanding stayed loyal for its most part.

During the “Demencial Tour”, which kicked off on December 18, 2004 in Buenos Aires at a sold-out El Teatro, Horcas toured Argentina, Ecuador, Venezuela, Uruguay and Colombia where they headlined the second stage at Rock al Parque Festival in Bogotá on October 16, 2006. Also for the first time in their career they performed outside Latin America: on April 30, 2006, Horcas played at Viña Rock Festival in Spain.

2006-2008 - Asesino

In 2006 Horcas are signed by SoyRock/TockaDiscos – Sony BMG, their first contract with a major. Under this deal they release on October 26, 2006 their eighth album Asesino, which takes experimentation a step further. This album has a significantly darker tone than any of its predecessors and received mixed reviews. However, the “Asesino Tour” 2007-2008 was extremely successful with almost 100 dates which included a slot in the Vive Latino festival in Santiago, Chile on April 15, 2007 and opening for Megadeth in Buenos Aires in May, 2008.

2008-present - Reviviendo Huestes / 20th anniversary Live CD and DVD

On October 16, 2008 Horcas released their ninth album Reviviendo Huestes. With a title that recalls the name of the song Reviviendo las Huestes included on their first album, Horcas seemed to suggest a return to the roots. However, the album does not abandon experimentation altogether, but rather revisits the past through a present day lens. Proof is the remake of their classic Solución Suicida which closes the album.

As from the beginning of 2009 Horcas are on the road with the "RH Tour", which has included opening gigs for Iron Maiden on March 28, 2009 at Vélez Sarsfield stadium for an audience of 40,000, and for Metallica on January 21, 2010 at River Plate stadium for a crowd of 60,000. On May 15, 2010 Horcas will record their tenth album and first DVD live at Teatro Colegiales in Buenos Aires as part of a series of events to take place throughout 2010 in celebration of their 20th anniversary.
