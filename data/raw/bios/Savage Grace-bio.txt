1. Savage Grace were Detroit's progressive rock band of the late '60s. With chops galore and a background rooted in jazz and R&B (with some good old-fashioned Detroit rock & roll thrown in for good measure), Savage Grace stood out from the rest of the Michigan bands as something special and as something quite eclectic. With Guitarist Ron Koss, keyboardist John Seanor, and drummer Larry Zack as the nucleus of a jazzy trio called Scarlet Letter (with two albums on Mainstream), the addition of vocalist/bassist Al Jacquez transformed the group into Savage Grace. The band was soon signed to Reprise and released its eponymous debut album in 1969. Upon moving to Los Angeles the following year, the group embarked on a second album, which took almost two years to complete. By 1972, the trail had ended and the bandmembers went their separate ways. Savage Grace never achieved the success that seemed like their due; certainly their musicianship was top-notch and their songwriting was good enough, but in the long run they were perhaps a bit too eclectic to find a mainstream audience. 

2. Savage Grace is a heavy metal band from Los Angeles, California. founded in 1981 by Christian Logue. The first official line up was Dwight Cliff-Vocals, Brian East-Bass, Dan Finch-Drums and Christian Logue-Guitars.
Savage Grace performed several live shows with this lineup and recorded several demos.
One track from these early demos, Scepters Of Deceit was featured on the Metal Massacre 2 compilation album.
In 1983, John Birk replaced Dwight Cliff on vocals and Kenny Powell was added as a second lead guitarist. This line up recorded The Dominatress E.P., released on Metal Blade Records. This version of the group played live shows in Los Angeles and San Francisco thru 1983.
1984 saw new vocalist Michael Smith join the band and Kenny Powell depart to form Omen. Former Witchkiller guitarist Kurt Phillips replaced Powell for several months. This incarnation of the group played several live gigs in the Los Angeles and Orange County areas.
While recording Master Of Disguise, Kurt Phillips was sacked. Christian Logue cut all the guitars on the recording.
After the completion of recording Master Of Disguise, Mark Chase Marshall, formerly of Agent Steel was brought on board as second lead guitarist.
Shortly before the first Savage Grace tour of Europe, which included a slot on the Metal Hammer Festival in September 1985, Michael Smith left the band. Christian Logue became the new vocalist and sang on all the European dates.
In late 1985, Dan Finch left the group. He was replaced in early 1986 by Marc Marcum.
Marcum, Logue, Marshall and East recorded After The Fall from Grace in the spring of 1986.
Savage Grace did a European tour with Heir Apparent in June 1986.
Upon returning to the states, Brian East left the group. He was replaced by former Heir Apparent bassist Derek Peace. This ensemble recorded the Ride Into The Night E.P. in early 1987.
In April 1987, Savage Grace supported Motorhead on twenty dates across the U.S.
Derek Peace left the group in the summer of 1987. The band went thru several bass players from 1987-1988. Marc Marcum left the band in 1988.
In 1989, Marshall Lee Dickerson was brought in on drums. In December of 1989 the band relocated to New York after signing with a new management company. Mark Marshall chose to stay in Los Angeles.
Mike Branning joined the band on bass in December 1989. Several guitarists filled in with the band in New York and on tour dates throughout the U.S.
Savage Grace recorded ten demo tracks while in New York.
