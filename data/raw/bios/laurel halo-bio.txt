Laurel Halo is a producer and electronic musician from Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States.  Influenced by her Midwest roots, the music speaks to new club ecologies, explored via abstracted rhythms, chaotic ambience and moody jazz elements.  As Halo once told to The Wire Magazine, "Techno is a meditative force that can process darkness and remove problems...in their place, the ideal of a non-threatening, transcended, sexually charged headspace emerges".  Physical process and temporal drift are recurring motifs in Halo's discography. She has released three full-length albums on the London-based electronic label Hyperdub Records.
