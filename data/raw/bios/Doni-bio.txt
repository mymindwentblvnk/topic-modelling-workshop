Doni is an electronic music producer/remixer/DJ  from Vancouver, Canada currently residing in Taipei, Taiwan. He first gained recognition on YouTube where several of his video game remixes went viral after being promoted by YouTube giants such as Vsauce2, Household Hacker, and Video Game Dunky. Eventually he caught the eye of the video game music record label GameChops, a friendship culminating in the ultimate 2015 release of Doni’s VGM remix album, “Button Masher”, an album mastered by DJ Cutman. Doni influences range from current popular electronica all the way back to obscure, cheesy, retro dance music. Nowhere is this more apparent than on his 2015 Future City Records release, “Pirate Disco”, an album influenced by Italo disco, retro electronica and video games. Doni’s music is decidedly retro in theme and spans across many genres; most often house, chill-out or electronica in style. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Doni">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
