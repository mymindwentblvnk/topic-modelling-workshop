Snaegr was born out of two friends growing interest for death metal and extreme metal in general. The name was lifted from a deamon featured in Games Workshop's classic tabletop game "Warhammer: Fantasy Battles" which was a common interest for us at the time.

We got together quickly during early 2008 and started to write songs out of sheer inspiration of doing something new, with Christofer creating the music and Fredrik the lyrics. Many songs were written, re-written and scrapped over and over until we had three songs we at the moment thought we had perfected.

During three month we worked on our first three song demo until we finally thought of it as done. After releasing "Ruin" in August the same year we let Snaegr take some rest. Instead we explored various other branches of extreme metal, and music in general, on our own while rechargeing our death metal-spirits. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Snaegr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
