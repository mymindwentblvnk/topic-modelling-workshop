Lazy J  - not to be confused with the other artist Lazy J on last.fm who has the album called "Still on Fire" - are a four piece band from the West Midlands. Their music is a fusion of funk, blues and rock which draws influence from a diverse range of artists such as George Clinton, Led Zeppelin, Jane's Addiction, James Brown, and Reef.

Kerrang FM have played an active part in creating a surge of interest in Lazy J by giving their songs regular airplay and broadcasting interviews with the foursome, as well as voting them "Unsigned band of the year".

In summer 2006, tracks from the band's EP Inner City Funktion received critical acclaim from Steve Craddock of Ocean Colour Scene, while 2008 saw the release of the band's first full length studio album, entitled Kick The Spin.

Outside the studio Lazy J are constantly gigging, having played headline sets at Camden Underworld, Birmingham Academy, The Yardbird (Birmingham), JB's Dudley and having also performed at Sound Leicester Square, Carlsberg Unsigned Festival, Storm Leicester Square and The Garage (London). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lazy+J">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
