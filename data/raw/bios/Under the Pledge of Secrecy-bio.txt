The band was founded in Aachen/Germany in early 2005 by Arthur E., Thorsten S. and Stefan K. with an experimental approach to create a unique mixture of various styles with focus on hard music. Starting with shows in the years 2006-2007, the band then also played Belgium, Luxemburg, France, and Denmark. After the debut EP “The Convoluted Line” (5 gegen 5000/ Yskalnari records) was released in 2008 alongside with subsequent line-up changes (Thomas. B. - guitars and Till. V. - bass) the band headed to studio in 2011 to release its full-length debut in mid-2012.  Tough times came up in 2012 and the release had to be postponed. In 2013/2014 more live shows were tackled i.e. sharing stages with bands like Tesseract, Animals as Leaders, Dying Fetus, Fallujah and Black Shape of Nexus. The first full-length entitled "Black Hole Mass Evolution" was finally released in November 2014. Until 2016 live promotion of the record was focussed. 2017 saw novel line-up changes and ideas, followed by conception of a new album in 2018. The new full-length "Empire of Bastards" is available since December 2019, gaining new fans round the globe.
