Halo of the Sun is a side project of the Axis of Perdition. Halo of the Sun started in 2004 when The Kult of Eihort collapsed. After recording a demo, called Ghost, the project was left aside and only came back to life in 2007 when the four songs of the "Ghost EP" were made available on the myspace page of Halo of the Sun.
