There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Brainless is a melodic hardcore band formed in Desio, Italy in 2004 when Andrea Damiano and Federico, who had already been playin together in a high-school band since 2002, found in Don'Eat the Chicken Ass' former drummer and bassist, the twin brothers Filippo "Mr. Philip" and Manuel "Ponch", the ideal musicians to complete their line-up. 
After some successful shows around Milan, the band recorded its first ep, Mental Trip, a fine blend of high-speed hardcore frenzy and vocal harmonies. 
The band extensively played live during 2006 and 2007, performing a setlist made out of both own compositions and melodic hardcore classic songs (mainly by Nofx and Strung Out). 
In the spring of 2008, Brainless hit the studio again, recording an 8-track LP, that shows the band's evolution to a more complex and guitar oriented music, while retaining that combination of harmony and speed that has been their trademark since the very beginning.
During the fall of 2008 Ponch left Brainless to focus on his own band, shortly followed by his twin Mr. Philip. In a few weeks, Davide and Alby  (A Faded Glory's drummer) filled in for them and as of 2009, the band is ready to hit the stage again!
