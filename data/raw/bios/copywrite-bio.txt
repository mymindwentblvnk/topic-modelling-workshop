Copywrite (born Peter James Nelson) is an underground hip-hop artist from Columbus, Ohio. A member of the Columbus crew MHz (or MegaHertz), Nelson emerged from the underground scene in 2002 with his collaboration with producer RJD2 on the track "Holier Than Thou". His debut album The High Exhaulted was released on the Eastern Conference label to some praise, although some felt that RJD2's beats were too dark for Copywrite's persona. His second release, Cruise Control Mixtape: Volume 1, was released on the O.D.O.T. record label in 2004. Copywrite was a member of Cage's rap 'supergroup' the Weathermen, but left after personal disagreements with Cage and Camu Tao.

Most recently, he has released a new mixtape, The Jerk: Volume 0 and appears on the UK rap group Rhyme Asylum's debut album. The Jerk... features guest appearances from Royce Da 5'9", Killah Priest, Catalyst, KingDom, Crooked I, Shabaam Sahdeeq, Thirstin Howl III, Meta4ce Omega, and Jakki Da Motamouth. It also features production from the late J Dilla, Jake One, Rocktight, the late DJ Przm, DR Period, platinum producers Cool & Dre, D-Dot, Needlz, Kickdrums, Chris Scholar, Jay Notes, Mighty Fuzz Young, and more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Copywrite">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
