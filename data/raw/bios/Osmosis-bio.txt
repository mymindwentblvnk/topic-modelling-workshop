US psychedelic progressive rock with jazz influences feat. Charlie Mariano. Originally released on RCA this 1970 progressive Jazz rock outfit created a full blown rock based performance with two drummers. The wall of sound was amazing with alto and soprano saxophones- courtesy of the great Charlie Mariano, whose career since 1944 has included bebop with Shelly Manne and electronic fusion with Eberhard Weber's Colours - wailing over the wall of sound. The mood ranges from spacey and saxy to (as evidenced on title track) full-on heavy stoner acid doom. - Freak Emporium

    Nothing sounded this innovative at it's given time. They opened for the Zappa bands and Miles Davis at " The Boston Tea Party"..in Boston. A great _Filmore style_ concert hall-club in Boston.
    In this record and the live gigs. Mariano was playing Alto saxophone and soprano saxophone. Flute and nagaswaram.
    Within a full blown rock based volume setting with two drummers. The wall of sound was amazing. Considering Charlie always played strong, this was a real event to hear.
    This band OSMOSIS was on a world based level with any major rock band.
They could of easily had the cult following that Jerry Garcia did with the Grateful Dead or even the song writing influence that other major stars did in that time period. After all this was 1970. There was not a "Bitches Brew" recording by Miles Davis yet, and no Brecker or Sanborn sax sonics had yet to appear.
    THIS BAND was one of the pioneer bands of the day. And-one of the most interesting.
    Maybe someday RCA will see it's importance and put it on CD-reissue.
    As Mariano moved to Europe from Boston in 1970, the stage was being set for some dramatic playing and world class saxophone innovations. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Osmosis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
