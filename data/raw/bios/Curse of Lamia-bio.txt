Starting from friendship 6 people who love music metalcore, which eventually formed a band metalcore. In July 2009 we launched the band., In the beginning the band was named Lamia with initial formation: Zulfi and Danoas as a vocalist, Hana and Lutfan as a guitarist., Fadryan as a bassist and a drummer Danil, but the lapse of time at the end of 2009 hana out of Lamia for reasons of differences in principle and concept of this band, since that time Lamia renamed "Curse of Lamia" and change their formation: Danil replace Hana as a guitarist and incoming new personnel Danu as a substitute drummer Danil position. In early 2010 fadryan out of the Curse of Lamia for some reason, and was replaced by Tito, our vocalist Zulfi out (temporarily) because of continuing education, with this formation we try to make your own songs that certainly could express what is in the soul and try to incorporate elements of melodic death metal in our songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Curse+of+Lamia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
