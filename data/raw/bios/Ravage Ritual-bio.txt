Ravage Ritual was formed 2011 in Seinäjoki, Finland. After a few smaller releases and the first full- length “Soul Eater”, this year will mark the release of their second full-length, entitled “Higher Power”. Influenced by bands like Integrity, Kickback, Arkangel, and Bolt Thrower, "Higher Power" forms a coalition of pure negative energy and northern darkness.
