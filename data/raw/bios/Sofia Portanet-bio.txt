SOFIA PORTANET is a German-French singer moving between the musical worlds of trip hop, post punk, and the alternative side of pop. Inspired by the likes of Blondie, Kate Bush and Nina Hagen, Sofia’s own music is also most strongly characterised by her unique voice. Producing songs in French, English and German, Sofia’s European sound centres around the universal themes of life, longing and love.
