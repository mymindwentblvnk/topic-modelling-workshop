Lord Wind is the Ambient/Folk side-project from Wroclaw, Poland created by Robert "Rob Darken" Fudali, in 1994. Graveland leader Rob Darken created this solo project two years after Graveland began. To date, Lord Wind has released four albums and one EP. The music is characterized by melodic folk instrumentals supported by driving militaristic percussion. And it is, according to Darken, influenced by medieval folk music, Dead Can Dance and the Conan soundtrack.
