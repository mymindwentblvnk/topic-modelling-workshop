The Fall Of Every Season is a one man atmospheric death/doom metal band from Norway that has existed since 2004, formed and performed by Marius Strand, on vocals, instruments and programming. The vision behind the project has been clear from the beginning: Creating a mixture of heavy and mellow musical expression, based on the contrast of melodic death/doom metal and a fragile acoustic sound. In 2007 the critically acclaimed debut album "From Below" was released. Still a one-man band, The Fall Of Every Season released "Amends" through Grau Records in 2013, and like the first release, "Amends" was an ambitious concept record, this time aiming to take the band's signature melancholic sound further. A new album is currently being recorded and will be released in 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Fall+of+Every+Season">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
