Hailing from The Netherlands and branded with their signature skull, Dutch duo DROELOE have taken the 'future bass' scene by storm. What began with a SoundCloud account - where they uploaded their own music and curated their favorite releases in their "Pokoe Pack" mixes - soon developed a reputation for creating impeccable percussion-heavy future bass infused with the catchiest melodies. Comprised of producer Vincent Rooijers and visual designer Hein Hamers, the duo's emphasis of both the music and visuals through both members' strengths has seen them weave intricate stories through both the music and visuals.

The duo is currently on tour with San Holo going to Asia, Australia, and North America. With their current trajectory indicating future stardom, one might say the question isn't "will it happen?" but rather "when"? <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DROELOE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
