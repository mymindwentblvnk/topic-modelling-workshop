British Hardrockers DEEDS were known throughout much of their career as DIRTY DEEDS, releasing a string of albums with heavy recommendation from none other tha Steve Harris of IRON MAIDEN. As DIRTY DEEDS the band released 1996's debut 'Danger Of Infection' and the 'Real World' album in 1999. The central figure of the act, frontman Pete Franklin, had been operational with trad Rockers CHARIOT for many years previous. Guitarist Richie Faulkner, joining the fold in 2001, was previously a member of SOLEMN TEMPLE.

In early 2002 the band would switch titles from DIRTY DEEDS to simply DEEDS, apparently reasoning that too many people thought they were an AC/DC covers band
