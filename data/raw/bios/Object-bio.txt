[*] 2. The American Object:

A two person cacophony of love and disintegration. Our blood sings at a frequency that will resonate in even the darkest recesses of your cold heart. Melting hopelessness away in a trance of intense distraction. Beat the drums to shake off your disgust at life’s empty promises. Convulsing in an orgasmic death twitch, echos of your former lives fighting to reach the surface. Gasping for air. Making you whole again.
