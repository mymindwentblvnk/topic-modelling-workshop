A New York City vocal group, Ace Spectrum never enjoyed any huge hits, although they were a decent soul ensemble. Henry "Red" Zant, Aubrey "Troy" Johnson, Elliot Isaac, and Rudy Gay comprised the lineup. They had one Top 20 R&B single, "Don't Send Anybody Else" in 1974, and also did a fine version of the song "Just Like in the Movies," though it didn't earn for them the same recognition it did for Bloodstone. ~ Ron Wynn, Rovi <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ace+Spectrum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
