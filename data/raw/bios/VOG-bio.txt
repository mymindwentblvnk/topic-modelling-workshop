Formed in the peak of the summer of 2004, VOG had its first jam in a basement in Oakton, Virginia. Vog came to fruition based on an intent to play music with other members who were serious enough to commit to playing on a regular basis. Riffs written out of pipe dreams flowed through the aura of dirge that released the steam of sour days.

Vog is the hawaiian term for a wretched gas/smoke present when volcanoes erupt that makes all that come in contact with it nauseous.
Vog also has symbolic meaning in the Runic language, an ancient European language that was used on inscriptions, monuments, and for magical divinatory purposes. In the Runic language, each character means something particular and combined into one they form something greater. Here's it correspondence with VOG:

V (Wyn) - the rune of pure joy and happiness, not through others but through the achievements of one's dreams and unique life path
O (Odal) - is the homestead, which was very precious to wandering peoples. It is used to represent all domestic issues and is a protective rune of the home.
G (Gyfu) - means the gift of giving. It also represented relationships, especially sexual ones, and is therefore one of the fertility runes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/VOG">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
