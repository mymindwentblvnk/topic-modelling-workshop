original band with their unique blending of punk rock, surf and electronic music performed with a large amount of energy in visually exciting live shows they quickly gained an audience. They crash landed in Auburn, Alabama, USA, in 1992. They are known to play some of the most pristinely crafted surf instrumentals since the 60s. Formed by CoCo the Electronic Monkey Wizard on alternate universe bass, Birdstuff on traps, Star Crunch on guitar, and Dr. Delecto & his invisible Vaportron on bass, the group released their first full-length album in 1993. The band found time to put out a new 45 record practically every other week in addition to full-length releases like 1994's Destroy All Astromen!, 1996's Experiment Zero and 1999's Eeviac. The themes of the tunes usually run the gamut from spies to sci-fi. Dexter X later replaced Dr. Delecto, and Starcrunch left the band as well. The collection, Beyond the Black Hole, was issued in summer 2001 and featured three brand new tracks. In 2001 the band started an extensive hiatus.  In 2006 they performed at the Touch n Go 25th Anniversary fest. In 2010 they announced that they will be reuniting for a few gigs . <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Man+or+Astro-Man%3F">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
