Arbiter of Conceit is a death/thrash/grindcore band comprised of members of bands based in Chicago IL, Richmond VA, Denver CO, and South Bend IN. We have been around since 2004 and released one demo called Desecration of the Immaculate and are awaiting the release of our full length, Eradico Consenescus Inritus. We have been compared to may of the usual bands you hear about but the most common comparisons have been Angelcorpse, Deeds of Flesh, Cephalic Carnage and Decrepit Birth although by our estimation, we can't pigeonhole ourselves to any of those bands though we are fans of all of them. We play shows occasionally. Check our myspace at http://www.myspace.com/arbiterofconceit <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arbiter+Of+Conceit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
