Pariah Syndicate is a menace containing members from the bands; Nurse, Avencore, Nano, Death Comes Pale and Rageborne.

Originally founded by JazpR and Kasper with the concept of a new breed, challenging metal music as well as the general idea of the scene and the present standards.

The Band took form in February 2007 and the rest of that year was spent in the rehearsal space, creating their contribution to the metal scene of today.

With loads of live experience they moved their focus from live gigs and put all of their efforts into making the mindblowing EP "...And Blood Shall Rain From Heaven".

Due to a lot of different influences the sound and the drive in their music is varied and challenging, as well as containing all the undying "metal classics" such as heavy breakdowns and groovy guitar riffs, a machinegun bassdrum, asspounding basslines and two very sexy and dynamic vocals.

The whole concept of the band being human corruption with highlights such as; religion, politics, greed, loath and so forth, not dictating - simply just telling.

The current state of the band today, is to blast away everyone attending their shows and buyers of their product. To reign on all small as well as big stages of the scene and rise above all expectations.
