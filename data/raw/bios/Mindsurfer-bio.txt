Roger Gnos is riding the waves of electronic sound since 2005 with his project Mindsurfer. Inspired by Pink Floyd, Depeche Mode, Yello and many others he often works with analogue synthesizers. His wide horizon makes itself noticed trough diversity. In the genres of Progressive Trance & Psytrance and Chillout he plays with expectations and boldly combines what usually does not work together. Melodic and harmonic parts combined with dirty basslines represent his sound. These are fresh tracks with high demands.

But that was not all; none of his ideas remain unexploited. Together with Goma he initiated the successful project Mode Modular and as Roger Mills he is into experiments with Deep House, Tech House and Techno since 2014.
