Formed in 1998, and developing their unique craft ever since, De Lirium's Order (FIN) embodies unmerciful brutality and insanity put to music. The band combines grinding blast beats, technical riffs, catchy thrash-lines, obscure melodies and manic guitar leads to create death metal onslaught. Starting out as a Melodic Thrash/ Death Metal band, they have over time evolved into a Technical Death Metal band with progressive influences. DLO's third album, entitled Veniversum was released March, 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/De+Lirium%27s+Order">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
