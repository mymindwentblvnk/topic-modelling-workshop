The band Guitar Wolf (ギターウルフ), founded in Nagasaki, Japan in 1987, are known for their piercing vocals and extremely loud style of garage punk that emphasized heavy distortion. They coined the phrase "Jett Rock 'n' Roll", a homage to rocker Joan Jett, which they also use to describe their musical style - an energetic cross between The Ramones, rockabilly, classic punk, and noise rock. The band star in cult classic zombie flick Wild Zero. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Guitar+Wolf">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
