Irathus is the end product of various one-man bands evolving from diverse forms of extreme metal. The one-man project began in 2002, and after numerous changes in direction and band name changes, Irathus was accomplished three years later with the release of The Grand Omnicidal Dream, a prototype of what the latter releases would sound like. This prototype is an amalgam of various form of extreme metal. Speed, brutality and aggression is what Irathus stands for.
