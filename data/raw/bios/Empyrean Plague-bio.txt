In 2002, Empyrean Plague began to take form in the vast forests of the Canadian North. Influenced by the harsh northern winters, founding members and guitarists Turmoil and Pawn, began crafting their ruthless, yet melodious sound. Soon after, they sought out others of like mind, enlisting drummer Treachery and recruiting bassist Dertah (Vanquished) to begin work on their first demo.

Upon completion, Dertah returned to Vanquished as E.P. began the quest for a permanent bassist. After some time they came upon their missing link, a lost spirit by the name of Unborn.

Empyrean Plague was now complete. In late 2003 they began recording for their debut full length album and set forth "Conquering the Elements". In years to come Pawn decided to leave the band and Unborn took up the guitar duties. Now the search for a new bass player was at their back. It took patience to find a new soul for this position but with time it would be a reality. Keltisch came into the brood with all that could be desired and all was complete!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Empyrean+Plague">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
