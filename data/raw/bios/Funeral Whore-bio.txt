This Dutch old school death metal band is as unpolished and raw as they should be. Featuring three guys and a girl is a welcome anomaly and with their first full album out this year their ascent has begun. Picture dark, desolate woods, barren landscapes and the absence of colour. Funeral whore is reminiscent of early Grave and is likely to satisfy lost souls searching for a place to feast on the rotten.

Lineup
Roy - Guitar & Vocals
Kellie - Guitar
vanDune - Bass
Nick - Drums

The Story
After a lot of lineup changes on the drummer seat the band finally made good progress in mid 2010. The first official release of material throughout a records label (Godeater Records Germany) was made in that same year. All demo material was released on pro-tape, 113 pieces and spreaded trough Till You Fukking Bleed from Poland. Also a “7 inch split was released with the sisterband Profanal from Italy by Blasphemous Art Records and Unholy Domain Records. 

In early 2011, the band signed at Chaos Records Mexico. In Februari 2012 the full length debut album “Step into Damnation” was released worldwide and has became a great succes in the old school death metal scene. Our full length debut album “Step into Damnation” is also released on tape by Kampf Records from Poland and also a French edition on tape released by Maltkross Productions from France. 

In 2013 Funeral Whore signed at FDA Rekotz from Germany for 2 albums. 
Lots of gigs were played in Holland and Germany together with Hail of Bullets, Sadistic Intent, Asphyx, Master, Lifeless, Deathronation, Obscure Infinity and Profanal.
