WSR is Emanuele Porcinai's solo project. Debut in 2015 with 'Stainless' on Contort Records, which was presented on the main stage at the 2015 edition of Berlin Atonal festival

Operating in the limbo between acoustic and synthetic music, humanising electronic sources while mutating sounds taken from real instruments and environments. Research and experimentation focuses on the possibilities given by self-built string instruments and their sonic physicality in both studio practice and improvisation/live performance.

Also co-founder and part of the project/label UNKNOT together with producer and dj Sciahri.
