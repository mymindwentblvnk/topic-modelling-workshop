1) Absolute Power is a British comedy series, set in the offices of Prentiss McCabe, a fictional public relations company (or 'government-media relations consultancy') in London, run by Charles Prentiss (Stephen Fry), and Martin McCabe (John Bird).

It started in 2000 as a Radio series on BBC Radio 4, with the 4 series and last (to date) series broadcast in 2004. A six part television series ran on BBC Two, towards the end of 2003; the second six-episode television series ran on BBC2 on Thursdays at 10 p.m. from 21st July - 25th August 2005. A one-off radio episode was broadcast on 3rd November 2006.

Its name is taken from a quote by the historian Lord Acton that "power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."

2) Absolute Power is also a British heavy metal band featuring Napalm Death bassist Shane Embury and record producer Simon Efemy on vocals. They released an eponymous debut in 2011.

3) Absolute Power is also a Hip-Hop group consisting of TheMoJoKing and Vision. Their critically acclaimed album "A Vision of Kings" was released in early 2006. It is considered a bit of an oddity in the hip-hop world, consisting of mostly deeply layered original production. Moreover, Absolute Power's debut produced a lyrical depth not considered the norm of today's rap music. Most of "A Vision of Kings" is reminiscent of Hip-Hop's golden age. The rest of the album, seems more of something you would here in a poetry lounge then on a rap record.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Absolute+Power">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
