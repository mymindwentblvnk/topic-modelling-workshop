BIO
Kama-Mara was formed in 2009 mutually by Adrian Medina, Alex Morgan and Chris Nunley.

Within the first couple of months, Kama-Mara recorded and released the " Venomous Trance E.P.".The E.P. was a blend of crust punk, death metal with stoner metal vibes and Kama-Mara was still trying to find their style. In July of 2010, Kama-Mara released their first full length album "Mortal Angst" on Dual-Spirit Records. Mortal Angst was heavier, faster and a bit more dark in concept than the previous release.

In January of 2012, Kama-Mara added Jake McMullen to the line-up as a second guitarist.

Kama-Mara will be jumping into the studio and releasing some new material the summer of 2012 and releasing (digitally) the EP entitled "The Great Affliction" in the summer of 2013, physical copies will soon follow. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kama-Mara">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
