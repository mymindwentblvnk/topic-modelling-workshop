"What do you hear when the Demons come?"

Late October 2004, A Sound was born...
Something new, aggressive and from the heart. This sound was christened 'Internal Conflict'.
With major influences being a combination of North American and Scandinavian Metal, Internal Conflict have a relentless style. The aggression is fed by the barrage that is created between drummer Dan Robbins and bassist Tom Ingram. On top of this wall of sound, guitarists Sean Rice and Matt Hall add a remorseless mixture of harmony, melody and speed. Making the hand complete is Harley Anderson with a vocal style best described as homicidal. Lyrically Internal Conflict focus on psychology, our corroding society, prophecy and predatory action. When performing live Internal Conflict deliver in uncompromising ferocity.
