Splashh is the making of Toto Vivian and Sasha Carlson forming late Feb 2012 in London, UK. They have a care free attitude within their songs creating a sound of sun drenched garage fuzz.

Growing up between Australia and the UK they have left the beaches behind to record some early tracks in a small bedroom in Hackney.
