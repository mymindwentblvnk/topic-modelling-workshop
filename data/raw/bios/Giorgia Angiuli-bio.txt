Born in Puglia, also known as the heel of Italy’s boot, Giorgia is a classically trained musician, composer and multi-instrumentalist. Very early on she developed a strong interest for electronic music and started to experiment with new live techniques. The solo project of Giorgia Angiuli stylistically moves between pop, techno and house. She uses her voice to create a dreamy dimension intensified by the use of unique toy instruments. During her set she combines keyboards, drum pad and theremin with the sounds of a toy flute, sax, trumpets and many other toys. Mixing all of these samples and loops she shapes a vibrating and energetic groove that sets the dance floor on fire.

From 2013 to the present Giorgia has had success releasing on some of the biggest labels, Stil vor Talent, Crosstown Rebels, Kindisch, Kevin Saunderson’s legendary techno KMS, Harry Klein, Einmusika, Systematic and Suara to name few. In 2018 her new EP “No Body No Pain” released on Stil Vor Talent.

As the years have passed Giorgia has increased her profile and visibility with her engaging online presence, it is no wonder every video she posts goes viral receiving thousands or millions of plays. For a small town girl from Puglia, now residing in Florence, this classically trained musician turned live electronic act is just getting started, so sit back and enjoy what’s to come! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Giorgia+Angiuli">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
