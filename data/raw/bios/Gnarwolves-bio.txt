Gnarwolves are a British punk rock band,formed in 2011 and based in Brighton, England. The band consists of brothers lead vocalist and guitarist Thom Weeks and drummer Max Weeks, and bass guitarist and backing vocalist Charlie Piper.

Gnarwolves were formed after the Weeks brothers' former band Kasa wound down. The brothers meet fellow Cornishman and ex-Rasputin member Charlie Piper on Facebook, after he posted about wanting to start a new band. A love of skateboarding, gruff punk, and partying would influence the Gnarwolves' sound and with building hype with shows in Brighton.

The self-released tape, Fun Club, appeared in 2011 and was followed by the vinyl-only CRU EP in 2012 on Tangled Talk, which was eventually reissued on CD by Big Scary Monsters later that year. Touring Europe in 2012 with The Wonder Years, The Story So Far, and Lower Than Atlantis, as well as their own headline slots, the band released the Funemployed single on German label Day by Day in mid-2013. At the beginning of 2014, American label Pure Noise collected all of Gnarwolves' previous releases on The Chronicles of Gnarnia, while the trio announced that their full-length debut album would be released toward the end of that year. After multiple tours and a three-year break, Gnarwolves returned to the studio, emerging with their sophomore album, Outsiders, in 2017.
