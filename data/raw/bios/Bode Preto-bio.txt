"Inverted Blood is going to be one of the most special releases in a VERY long time in extreme metal, not just from Brazil either, period." 
Alan Moses (Glorious Times - USA)

‘Bode Preto means ‘black goat’ in Portuguese, and that should be all the info you need, ‘cos if you’re not excited about self released occult death metal from Brazil, especially in these times of revival of all things dark and brutal, then you are not worthy of it. [7.5]’ (Terrorizer Magazine - UK)

‘Dark Night EP brings us back to the root stylings of old school satanic death metal. They are a three piece band formed in March of 2009 but if you are looking for flash, technicality, breakdowns or slam riffs you will have to look elsewhere. What Bode Preto does is takes just a good old fashioned, thrashy, speed metal type riff approach and throws a hint of punk in their music.’ (Illusions Webzine - USA)
