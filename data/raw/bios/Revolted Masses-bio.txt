Revolted Masses is a death/thrash/prog metal band from Athens, Greece,  formed in 2008.
Their music is a mixture of death metal riffs, oriental melodies, progressive passages and radical political lyrics.. In June 2009 they released their self-titled demo, which contains 4 songs and was well-received, giving the band some attention. 
''Seeds of Revolt" is their second release, and it was released in October 2010.  At the moment, they try to give as many concerts as possible, in order to gain experience being a new band, while a long-range aim is to present their full-length album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Revolted+Masses">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
