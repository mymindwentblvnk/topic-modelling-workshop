Stassen, Steven and Bart had been playing with the thought of starting a band for a long time, there was only one condition... it had to be hard and compromiseless! They enlisted 
Tristan to do the vocals. Not long after that, the whole thing got put on hold because of a 
wrist-infection that kept Bart from drumming for half a year. 

Summer of 2003, after Bart's recovery the band found a suitable guitarplayer to make it a 
five-piece, Simon joined ranks and Sludge Phenomenon was born... 

2004, a bunch of fast-paced death/thrashmetal songs were completed and they started playing 
gigs, their first gig being with Panchrysia and Leng Tch'E, the reactions were great. 
Late 2004, Simon and Bart announced that they were going to travel Asia for a while. The band decided it would be best if they searched for replacements. After quite some time, these were found in Lex and Jef. 

 With the line-up now being rock-solid, the songs became more technical, evolving towards a more varied mix of styles, since all members come from a different musical background, but 
all share a mutual interest in extreme music.
Being support act for bands like Enthroned, Nashville Pussy and Cult Of Luna opens the road to bigger stages for the band.
In 2006 Sludge Phenomenon entered the studio to record three tracks, a total of 20 minutes, for their Paradox EP, which was later released in august.
In 2007 Tristan decided to leave the band and Tim stood up as the new vocalist.
