"Debut full-length album “From Under The Tarn” is a brilliant first step of a Swedish doom metal band S:T Erik towards the top of the genre. The music is mainly inspired by bands like Ufomammut, Sleep, Om, Electric Wizard and High On Fire. But the combined influences of the members’ previous engagements (ranging from death metal and stoner to post-rock), extensive use of spacey synthesizers and something as rare as a talented vocalist, result in an interesting sound, quite unique to the genre. Psychedelic doom metal filled with dense riffs performed by S:T Erik is an outstanding discovery for adepts of the genre." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/S:T+Erik">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
