Mass Shivers are a psych-punk-what-have-you power trio from Chicago, Illinois. Over the last 6 years their style has varied from that of Red Krayola-esque, Reichian-meets-hardcore implied rock to rhythm heavy double drum and twin guitar deliverance to quite tight and slamming traditional power trio finesse in the vein of Groundhogs, ZZ Top, Rush, and The Minutemen. To date, they have released albums and contributed tracks to various comps on the Sickroom (US) and Pickled Egg (UK) labels, as well as a smattering of limited vinyl-only and CD-R releases on their own Licking River Records.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mass+Shivers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
