GOREPHAGIA (Ex-Intestinal Infection) is an Ecuadorian (South America) band which is surprising the world with its corrosive and dirty Brutal Death/Grind sound, unstoppable drum`s blast beats, guttural and sick voices, and dense and sawing riffs; such an ensemble will make your brain decompose in extreme pure sickness! If you are a real fan of bands such as DISGORGE (Mex) or CARNAL (Col), without doubt GOREPHAGIA will let you more than satisfied. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gorephagia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
