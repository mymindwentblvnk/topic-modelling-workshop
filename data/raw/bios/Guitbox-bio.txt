Shea Rutsatz learned to play the guitar. He learned to play the Drums. Then he proceeded to write music, and record it. He started a band, and sang whilst playing the guitar, and writing the music. This ended, but he kept making the musics. Thus, "Guitbox" was created; an alternate identity in which to label his music under. 

Starting from Thrash, then widening into Doom, Rock, Blues, Punk, and Melodic has been an interesting journey, and very creative. Not limiting himself to one genre, he plays a variety of styles, which hopefully appeases anyone who happens upon his music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Guitbox">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
