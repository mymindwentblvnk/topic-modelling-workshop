Loons is the former band of the members of Flowers From The Man Who Shot Your Cousin and Cowbird. They've released two albums on Elefant Records and Galaxie Train respectively in Spain and Japan.

old bio:

At a time when Erwan was beginning not to attend classes anymore, he and Morgan met in a Parisian school upon Morgan's return from a 3 year, late childhood stay in the US. After a few years of youthful, light-hearted occupations such as "do-it-yourself-ping-pong" or secret escapades by train to the Brittany shores, we finally got around to make music. After at least two more years of brilliant if unrewarding work we started Loons and eight months later, in February of 1993, through an ad at the local independent record store, we met Caroline (who had up till then been spending her leisure time doing poetry and other artful crafts in the south of France and listening to the same sounds as we).

Incidentally she was the only person to ever answer the ad so it never occurred to us that we might have been lucky there. Since then she has become the indispensable third pillar supporting the weight of our hopes and dreams (sigh). A first LP was released in Spain through Elefant records around 96 and, since then, the trio has been solidified by orchestra musician, Catherine, who has been "performing" the viola parts on the most recent songs and Pauline who has been play flute on the new songs. We are all still in our twenties (thank God) though we are dangerously "nearing that big moment" when the two becomes a three..... and to think two of the three can't even drive yet (how sad)...... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Loons">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
