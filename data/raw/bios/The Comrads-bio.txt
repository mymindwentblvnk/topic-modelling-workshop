Longtime protégés of West Coast heavyweight Mack 10, Comrads is made up of Kmac and Gangsta, a pair of Lynnwood rappers that try to carry the torch of West Coast Gangsta Rap. The pair made a major splash in the L.A. area in the summer of 1997 with Homeboyz. After struggling to find a home, Comrads setup camp with Mack 10's private label, Hoo Bangin'. In 2000, Comrads released their first album for a major label, Wake Up & Ball. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Comrads">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
