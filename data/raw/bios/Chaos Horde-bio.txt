Chaos Horde hails from Baton Rouge, LA and was a powerful contender in the 80s metal/hardcore underground at that time. The band played numerous shows in the New Orleans area alongside bands such as Exhorder, Graveyard Rodeo, Slugs[early Crowbar] and countless others! The band's style can best be described as having the aggressiveness and speed of Hardcore yet incorporating the intricate rhythm and lead playing of Heavy Metal. The band has remained inactive over the years but still maintains an almost "legendary" status, while fans of the local metal scene are always on the lookout for hard-to-find demos and recordings. needle damage, is from the 1986 metal blade release, metal massacre ..9. the other songs here were recorded by electric earl on a 4 track cassette machine at the turkish baths in baton rouge louisiana sometime around 1986. if anyone would like to see a reunion show, let us know, we've been thinking about it, and we just might do it. we are also thinking about doing a new record to celebrate 20 years of thrash. remember when metallica was cool? <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chaos+Horde">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
