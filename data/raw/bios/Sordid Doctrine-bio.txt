From the remains of one of Richmond's top hardcore bands emerged Sordid Doctrine. This band also broke new ground in the Richmond hardcore scene. These guys were one of the original math rock bands. They had a lot of equipment and went from very fast & very loud to complex off beat very slow and twisted musical arrangement. They were an "must see" live band. They played at such a high volume that the stage would just jump and the bass volume that hit you so hard that if you were near the stage it was hard to breath.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sordid+Doctrine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
