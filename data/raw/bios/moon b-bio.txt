Moon B, real name Wes Gray, is an electronic music producer from Atlanta, United States. A bonafide hardware freak & $1 bin record digger par excellence. Sometimes Moonâ€™s music makes you want to get on the floor & slam-dance, lost in the fog & strobes while other times it sounds like your box is chewing up your tape mid trip while keeping the beat. Both outcomes we find extremely rewarding but we'll let you judge for yourself. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moon+B">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
