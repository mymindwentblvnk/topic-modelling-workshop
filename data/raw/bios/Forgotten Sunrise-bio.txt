Forgotten Sunrise is an Estonian Electronic/Industrial band known for playing Doom/Death metal in their early stage era.

“I do believe this is a violation against some universal laws of music,” hailed The Metal Observer, giving an album maximum points - “Psychedelic, trippy, schizophrenic, disturbing and utterly mesmerizing!” Setting Dead Can Dance, David Lynch, Katatonia, Celtic Frost and Clock DVA as intellectual role models, Forgotten Sunrise is able to create honest and unique music that is difficult to compare or define. There is a great deal of alternative dance music in their style, the grim tone of metal, the unruliness of jazz and Lynchesque unpredictabilities. Forgotten Sunrise, active in the dark music scene since the early nineties, has gained a respectable audience in Estonia and often-visited neighbouring countries. In addition to local releases, their albums have been published on foreign soil - in Finland and Italy. Their tracks have been on compilations in many different countries, as well as used in theatre productions and indie-movies.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Forgotten+Sunrise">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
