PYR EXOTERON is a biblical term for "Outer Fire". According to the christian faith, this is a remote hellish inferno, purposefully created to be the most agonizing punishment by our loving god, and preserved only for those sinners who have committed the ultimate blasphemy of denouncing the holy spirit, so they can forever burn in agony......
