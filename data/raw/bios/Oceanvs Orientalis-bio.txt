Founded by Safak Oz Kutle, Oceanvs Orientalis is a formation which aims to challenge the aesthetic perception in electronic music.

It blends itself with the archaelogic tunes of mankind’s cumulative musical history and in this very context believes that “everything comes from the east”.

Despite of being an electronic-based formation -due to practical reasons- at the moment, it intends to transform into a dance (to move the body and feet to music) orchestra where each instrument will be played by its own instrumentalist.
