Verdict Denied started as Verdict in 1995. They released their first demo in 1997, to rave reviews from the international underground press. Two more demos were released, in 2001 and 2003 respectively, and the band shared a stage with Paul Dianno, Anvil and Tank, among others. Verdict Denied finally re-entered the studio in 2005, to record their first album, containing 8 songs, and at over 50 minutes running time. A rough mix of this recording gained great reviews for the band by magazines such as Terrorizer (7/10) and Metal Hammer (8/10) and gathered the attention of Jeff Waters of Annihilator, who offered to do the final mix and mastering at his Watersound studios. The band is now looking for a record deal. A sample five-songs (“Dark Twisted Laughter”, Battle Within”, “94 X 1 Vain”, "The Last Act" and "Black Tango") of this album are uploaded in this profile plus a pre-production demo of a new song (track No 1- "Action Defensive").
