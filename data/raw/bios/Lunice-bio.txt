Lunice Fermin Pierre II (born 1988), better known by his stage name Lunice, is a producer and DJ from Montréal, Canada. Lunice and Hudson Mohawke also formed the production duo TNGHT.

Lunice is a child of Filipino and Haitian immigrants.

Lunice started as a b-boy, dancing competitively for the 701 Squad. In the early 2000s, Lunice was inspired to make his own music after hearing how producer 9th Wonder constructed beats on the computer program Fruity Loops.

In 2007, Lunice played his first gig at Hovatron's monthly Bass Culture in Montréal, where he met Sixtoo, and was invited to perform at the Megasoid parties. He has been a part of the Turbo Crunk crew ever since.

In 2008, Lunice released a video for Lazersword's "Gucci Sweatshirt". In 2010, he participated in the London installment of the Red Bull Music Academy. Also in the same year, Lunice performed at the Sonar Music Festival.

Lunice signed to LuckyMe for the release of two EPs, 'Stacker Upper' (2010) and 'One Hunned' (2011), and soon connected with producer Diplo and his Mad Decent label for a remix of Deerhunter's "Helicopter", which led to further collaborations on remixes, mixes for the likes of BBC Radio 1, and performances with the Mad Decent Block Party. In 2011, Lunice collaborated with Azealia Banks and was featured in her video for the song "212".

Since then, he has done work with such labels as XL Recordings, Warner Bros. Records, Palms Out Sounds, Young Turks, Big Dada, and Top Billin’. Throughout 2010 and 2011, Lunice toured internationally.

Lunice and Hudson Mohawke formed the group TNGHT, for the 2012 release of an EP on Warp Records/LuckyMe, following a successful headlining Warp's SXSW showcase earlier in the year. The duo met in 2008, when Lunice booked Hudson Mohawke to perform at one of his Turbo Crunk parties. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lunice">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
