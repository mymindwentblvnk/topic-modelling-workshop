inÂ·veigh (in-'vA): To give vent to angry dissaproval, to protest vehemently Giving vent to angry dissaproval is something Inveigh knows a great deal about. Inveigh is a simple band...four angry, working class men from Montreal, that know how to play and are carrying the torch for the next generation of metal. Old school thrash sensability meets with new school death metal technicality and grindcore insanity to form a brand of metal that you can get behind. Fueled by the passion for metal that boils their blood with the pure metal fury, Inveigh are poised to deliver the goods with surprising intensity. The band's extreme live show is rivaled only by their studio fervor, earning them a spot on the same stage as grindcore forefathers NAPALM DEATH, hard working death metal act MISERY INDEX and the extremely brutal, extremely underground PUTRID PILE. A strong work ethic and a love of the road are the staples of Inveigh's career. With the understanding that this band will be delivering the goods with or without label support, Inveigh marches onwards creating their own opportunities and fighting to be heard. 4 years and counting....this has just begun. Keep your ear to the ground and you're guaranteed to feel the impact this band is making. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inveigh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
