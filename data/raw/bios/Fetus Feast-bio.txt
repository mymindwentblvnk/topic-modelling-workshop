Fetus Feast is a Canadian slam death metal band from Ontario. 

Fetus Feast was originally a side project of Nathan Mitic, Sam Smit & Josh Maes of London, Ontario's The Myriad Burial. When The Myriad Burial parted ways, the obvious solution was to make Fetus Feast their full time project.

They currently only have a 2-song demo out that was released in 2010, but are planning for more material in the future.

Fetus Feast is
Sam Smit - Guitars/Vocals
Josh Maes - Fretless Bass
Nate Mitic - Vocals/Studio Drums
