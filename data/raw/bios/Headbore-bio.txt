HEADBORE are a metal band from Adelaide South Australia. With an emphasis built around progressive song structures, the music while brutal at its core still has traces of melody. HEADBORE has created a style unique to the Australian metal scene. With fast guitars, furious beats, thunderous bass, aggressive vocals fused with groove filled sections, guitar harmonies and the occasional clean tone, a wide range of metal is covered. 

The debut album “Strength In Numbers” features 10 songs and was recorded by Andy Kite @ Against The Grain studio and mastered by the legendary Jens Bogren from Fascination Street Studios in Sweden, who has mastered bands such as, Opeth, Soilwork, Katatonia and Devin Townsend amongst others. The hype surrounding the release of the ‘Strength In Numbers’ album has been based solely on word of mouth from their energetic and intense live performances which has seen them play alongside some of Australia’s finest artists including Frankenbok, ROME & Truth Corroded. HEADBORE have also played on some of Adelaide’s premier music festivals, The New Dead Metalfest & Metal For A Cure which line ups included Be’Lakor, Lynchmada & Kyzer Soze to name a few. The Adelaide launch of ‘Strength In Numbers’ on November 29th 2013 included the line-up featuring Hypno5e (France), Truth Corroded, Rome, Desecrator, Alkira & Blood Covered Shovel. 
Their second album "The Grey" was released in May 2016 and raised the bar from the bands powerful debut. Potent powerful grooves have become a trademark of the band’s sound, embellished with hook laden melody.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Headbore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
