The passion for art took place in his infancy; when he was a little child he started to draw and paint, and later he also started with guitar and piano lessons. All His life was around art: from design and paint to music, and other kind of expressions.
 
Ivan Jaime is a passionate person, looking for the beauty in all the little things that bring sense to life. He feels that great moments give meaning to our short life. That's also what he want to express with the dark soul project, in his music and dj sets. The atmospheres, are the stamp of the DSP, together with the deep feelings coming from it. The Dark Soul Project trust that every moment in our life  is accompanied by sounds, waves, that have a different effect on people. Each frequency will have a special response, sometimes sad, sometimes happy, sometimes looking for balance. The goal is to play with feelings, and have a great time.
 
Ivan believes that all things around uss have an architecture, all is perfect but sometimes things are not in the correct order so, is assigment he feels he has to search and found the balance, between the people and music.
