Nikolas:
Vocals, Synth, and Drums

Jakob:
Guitars, Bass and Synth 

Nikolas and Jakob have experimented several times with bands before, this is only the latest incarnation of creativity and genre mixing, and may very well be one of the last. Drawing influence from Doom Metal, Black Metal, Drone, and Goregrind as well as other things. Archaic Horror is an uncommon blend of musical influences. This has only just begun, tomorrow is untold, yet it will someday become just another yesterday.

Archaic Horror does not have a point of view, Archaic Horror does not have emotions. Archaic Horror does not have an agenda beyond the creation of music. There is no underlying statement to society, there is nothing besides the music conveyed and the lyrics muttered. We are not racists, national socialists, or nazis, but we do appreciate the power of charismatic public speakers such as Adolf Hitler. We are not satanists, pagans or affiliated with any form of organized religion. To be against any specific religion, is to feed the beast of religion.
