J.U.F., (Jewish-Ukrainishe Freundschaft), is a collaboration between members of  Gogol Bordello  and  Balkan Beat Box  released in 2004 by Stinky Records. The name is obviously inspired by the German punk-industrial band  DAF (Deutsch-Amerikanische Freundschaft), which again was inspired by GDR state organization Deutsch-Sowjetische Freundschaft (German-Soviet Friendship).

The second "J.U.F. 2" album, entitled "Balkan Reggaeton" was set to come out in 2008, but was never released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/J.U.F.">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
