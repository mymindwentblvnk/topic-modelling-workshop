Overruled is a thrash/speed/heavy metal band from the Netherlands.

Raised listening to old school hard rock on vinyl, these young guys know no other life than the heavy metal life. Not only do they like to listen to Speed, Thrash and Heavy Metal and go to gigs and shows, now they are adding to the genre as well with their own songs as OVERRULED.

Overruled is the living proof of how music connects people. The story of how they came together is hazy and long, but many mutual friends and vague acquaintances have played their parts.

In short, it all started in 2009 when Marco and Martijn met  due to a series of fortunate events. Playing with half a dozen different guitarists over a few years, a perfect match couldnâ€™t be made. Martijn knew Ronald from their joint adventures in the local skate park and asked him to try jamming once. Ronald never left. Because of the many concerts Ronald goes to, he meets many people, and luckily one of them knew Remco, in whom they found a great singer and guitarist. January 2012, Overruled was born. Their mutual passion for metal created an instant bond, which they show on stage.

A lot has happened since January 2012. They have played many shows throughout the country and year, leaving them ready to take the next step: their first EP! The EP contains 6 tracks which will take the listener on a journey through a spectrum of metal, from catchy heavy metal to aggressive thrash metal. The release date is December 1st.

The guys are at ease being in the spotlights and really get the crowd going with their young enthusiasm and passion for music. They gained much experience over the past year and a half and they leave people wanting more!
