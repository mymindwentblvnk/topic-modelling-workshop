Consummatum Est were formed in the end of 2003 by Emanuele "Vastitas" Telli on vocals, keyboards and bass; Daniele, on drums; Federica on vocals. In the beginning of 2004 Michele joined the band as guitarist. The music they played was black metal with gothic influences. In the middle of 2004 Consummatum Est changed their music style and become a doom metal band. In April 2005 they released their autoproduced debut album Funeral procession, containing three tracks of decadent and dramatic doom metal. In the end of 2005 Federica, Michele and Daniele left Consummatum Est due to personal reasons. However, Emanuele wrote new material and in July 2006 recorded a new album called "The choir of the dead", helped by guest musicians. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Consummatum+Est">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
