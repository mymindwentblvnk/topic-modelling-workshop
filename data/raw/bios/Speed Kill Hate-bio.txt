Speed Kill Hate is a Thrash Metal band from New Jersey  led by Overkill guitarist Dave Linsk, he forming the group with the intent on playing material not suited to his main band. In short order he had a full band (including two other guys with ties to Overkill) and in 2005 Acts of Insanity was released. Truth be told, the material here isn't that far removed from prime Overkill, though it is generally faster and Mario Frasca's (G//Z/R) hardcore roar gives the sound a meaner, harsher edge. This is generally enjoyable though a bit samey (Frasca's vocals may be partially responsible for that). Since the release of Acts Of Insanity Linsk has put together an entirely new lineup. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Speed+Kill+hate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
