Founded by brothers Brian and Jason Daniloski, this hardworking, Baltimore, MD-based band has been constantly releasing material and touring since 1993. After a deluge of releases on 7-inch vinyl and compilations, MEATJACK found a home with At A Loss Recordings in 1999 and released their first full length CD Trust . A split CD and 10-inch vinyl record with Prank Records artists Damad followed in 2000.

Also in 2000, infamous filmmaker John Waters used the MEATJACK song "Upstart" (from Trust ) in his motion picture Cecil B. Demented ; the song appeared on the soundtrack along with songs by The Locust, Moby, and Liberace.
