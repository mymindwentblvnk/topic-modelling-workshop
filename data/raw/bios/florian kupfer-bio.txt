Although Florian Kupfer’s upwards trajectory through the world of late-night club land has been swift, it isn’t surprising. Music has always played a central role in his life, from singing in the choir as a boy, to devouring hip hop plates as a teen to discovering house and techno at his friends place. But it was a trip to Offenbach’s dance palace Robert Johnson that triggered an unquenchable thirst in Kupfer, and opened a world of electronic music up to him. Fast forward, and Kupfer is sending L.I.E.S. boss Ron Morreli a selection of tracks, and the result is the metamorphic Life Trax, a raw freewheeling EP that’s both rough and smooth, deep and propulsive. Timeless music will always last, and Kupfer’s got plenty in his boxes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Florian+Kupfer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
