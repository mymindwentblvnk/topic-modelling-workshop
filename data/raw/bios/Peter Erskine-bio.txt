Peter Erskine (born June 5, 1954) is a jazz drummer.

He was born in Somers Point, New Jersey, USA. He began playing the drums at the age of four. His professional career started in 1972 when he joined the Stan Kenton Orchestra. After three years with Kenton he joined Maynard Ferguson for two years. In 1978 he joined Weather Report, joining the legendary Jaco Pastorius to form a formidable rhythm section. After fours years and five albums with Weather Report he joined Steps Ahead.

Erskine has enjoyed a long and successful career as a session drummer, recording and touring with many top jazz and rock artists, including Steely Dan.
He also releases very influential teaching, both in his excellent books as in videos and DVDs, even online.

His music-style spanning talent also features on Kate Bush's 2005 album Aerial, where Erskine teams with bass player Eberhard Weber. Diana Krall, Eliane Elias, Queen Latifah and Linda Ronstadt among many more still choose Peter for his multifaceted musicality. Even Scottish and Finnish Classical Orchestras have had him as a featured musician. He is currently on the music faculty at the University of Southern California.
