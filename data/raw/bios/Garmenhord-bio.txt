Somewhere in late 1998 a few guys from the same region in Flanders: the 'Meetjesland', decided to form a pagan metalband: Haat(guitars) and Plaegh (drums) from Sleidinge, and Vraeck (vocals) and Kaiser (bass) from Beke. This band was a continuation of the black metal activities performed by Haat and Plaegh as early as 1994

The lyrics of the band deal with heathen hymns, in old- Flemish tongue, mostly dealing with local Meetjesland subjects: local landmarks, forests and myths

Garmenhord split up on 14/12/2005. The resting members then formed the band Ransacker. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Garmenhord">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
