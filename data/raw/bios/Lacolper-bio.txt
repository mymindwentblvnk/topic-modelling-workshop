Lacolper is a Swedish "Schizometal band". A term that the band applied to their music after a comment made by Per Nilsson(Scar Symmetry).

Tha band started rehearsing at their old school in 2001, and have been experimenting with all kinds of metal since then, as well as new members.

They have recorded two demos: "Day of Deliverance"(2004), and "Demo 2006"(2006) and hopefully a full-lenght is to follow soon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lacolper">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
