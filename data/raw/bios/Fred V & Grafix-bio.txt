Fred V and Grafix is the collaborative name of Drum and Bass producers, Fred Vahrman and Josh Jackson.
 
Fledgling stars Fred Vahrman and Josh Jackson a.k.a Fred V & Grafix signed to Hospital at the end of 2011 and have been making waves ever since with regular appearances on BBC Radio 1Xtra and mini mixes on Annie Mac’s show. A pair of producers who have been working together for the past five years now and showing huge promise, the boys brought us an abundance of musical gems before they delivered their debut EP on Hospital in March 2013.

Initially into live music, the pair converted to D+B when they heard Pendulum’s controversial and genre-changing album “Hold Your Colour” and High Contrast’s sophomore “High Society”. Influenced by an eclectic range of sounds outside of D+B, from electro/French house, ambient and hip hop, Fred V & Grafix cite artists such as Flying Lotus, Bonobo, Dilla and Jimi Hendrix as key inspirations, alongside fellow Hospital artists High Contrast and Logistics.

Having already released music on Allsorts and Talkin Beatz, and received Radio One support from Zane Lowe and Annie Mac, Fred V & Grafix made their first appearance on Hospital as part of the “Fifteen Years Of Hospital Records” album with “Find My Way” and have continued to take the label by storm. As well as producers within their own right, Fred V & Grafix have also stunned us with their remixes of Emeli Sande – “Daddy”, Skepta – “Hold On”, Camo & Krooked – “All Fall Down” and not forgetting their amazing remix of Rudimental’s chart-topping No. 1 hit “Feel The Love”.

Since signing to Hospital, Fred V & Grafix impressed with their Sick Music 3 contribution “Major Happy” and the epic “Purple Gates” which appeared on Hospitality D&B 2013 before finally bringing us their debut solo release, the awe-inspiring “Goggles EP” which dropped in March 2013. In 2014 their debut album "Recognise" was released.

With the album, an American and New Zealand tour planned before the summer festival season, this is going to be an epic year for the duo.
