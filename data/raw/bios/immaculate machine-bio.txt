Immaculate Machine was a Canadian indie pop band from Victoria, British Columbia, active from 2003  to 2011. The group consisted of Brooke Gallupe on guitar, Kathryn Calder on keyboard, Caitlin Gallupe on bass, Aden Collinge on drums and Jordan Minkoff on guitar. Leslie Rewega occasionally toured with the band playing keyboard and percussion. Brooke Gallupe performs most vocal parts, but Kathryn Calder often joins as a backing vocalist.

The band's name is taken from the lyrics of "One-Trick Pony" from the album One-Trick Pony by Paul Simon.

The band released The View and Transporter independently before signing to label Mint Records in early 2005.

Their Mint Records debut, Ones and Zeros, came out on September 6, 2005, and they supported the album with a tour of Canada and the United States. That year, Calder also became a sometime member of The New Pornographers, appearing on the album Twin Cinema and touring with the band. She is the niece of New Pornographers leader A.C. Newman.

In early June 2007, the band's song Jarhand, the first single from their third album Immaculate Machine's Fables, was featured as the iTunes free single of the week.

In 2009, the band saw some member changes. Luke Kozlowski left the band and was replaced by Aden Collinge. Caitlin Gallupe, Brooke's sister, joined the band on bass guitar. She previously designed the band's album covers and performed some backing vocals on Immaculate Machine's Fables. The group also added a second guitarist, Jordan Minkoff and an occasional member, Leslie Rewega, on keyboards, percussion and background vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Immaculate+Machine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
