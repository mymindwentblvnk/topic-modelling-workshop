OFFICIAL RELEASE (2006)
"Fearless" by André França

"What the hell was that?!". This is the first impression you get once you hear the first guitar riff from the song "The Martyr". Those guys aren't kidding! There's no good intention here! "The Martyr" punches you in the face since the beginning. You'd better get out of the way or bang your head at once as the death flame are surrounded by the rising keyboard notes pretty well applied.

Great dynamics do the right job during this song which isn't easy to classify if you're a newbie starving for a label to insert before this great slice of metal. Then we get to where you first take as a slower tune. The "slow" word has no place here. That's a fact! Even with the right piano notes and almost creepy silence you can feel the hurricane vibe that's approaching. And believe me, it does!

This song "Fearless" presents itself as a mature song from mature composition providers. The necessary feeling in each guitar duo, bass attack, drums despair and powerful strings are there for their well explained reasons. Once again the dynamics strikes on the nerve. Bang your head and growl at the same time. Why? Hear it! Then join me. Metal is proud!
