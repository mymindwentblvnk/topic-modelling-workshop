A fellowship of individually talented songwriters, initially brought together by a phonographic love for The Virgins, The Strokes, The Police and Phoenix, have finally emerged from their London hideout to introduce themselves. Cha-Cha have had a busy first year together writing, recording and performing their debut album, ‘We Are…’, and are now finally ready for you to take notice.

Having crafted what the self-confessed perfectionists describe as “a cross between dirty pop hymns and offbeat disco rock”, Cha-Cha hit the London gig circuit in March 2009 and soon found the demand for their 4-track demo CD going way beyond their control, as new fans witnessing their truly energetic live performances became eager to take something else beside the memories home - all the while the tactful trio still aiming to remain relatively under the radar until their pop-fuelled debut album was ready.

Cha-Cha, which features Blain McGuigan on lead vocals/bass, Alex Cameron Ward on secondary vocals/guitar, and Samuel Garbutt on drums, use a variety of synths, noises and looped effects to significantly boost their distinctly three-piece sound to another level. With a primary focus on vocal hooks, driving basslines, jingly guitars and danceable beats, the band want to get as many feet moving, heads bopping and hands clapping for as long as you’ll let them.
