Get Him Eat Him was an indie rock band which formed in February of 2004 in Providence, Rhode Island, United States. They consisted of Matt LeMay (vocals, guitar), Jason Sigal (guitar), Joe Posner (bass), Raf Spielman (keyboards) and Jeff Wood (drums). Spielman left the band in 2007 and was replaced by Kevin Sparks (guitar, keyboards)

Get Him Eat Him consisted of five young men with passable small motor skills playing big, confusing music. Paroxysm-laden pop that balances gravity and gratuitousness, the music of Get Him Eat Him has been described as "a hybrid of The Wrens, Enon, and Weezer's pop sensibility." 

In July of 2004, Get Him Eat Him signed to Absolutely Kosher Records, home of The Wrens, Frog Eyes, and Sunset Rubdown (Spencer from Wolf Parade). 

Get Him Eat Him played shows with Karate, The Wrens, The Arcade Fire, The Constantines, Black Dice, and The Walkmen. The band released their debut album, recorded at John Vanderslice's Tiny Telephone Studios by Jay Pellicci (Deerhoof/Erase Errata), July 26, 2005 on Absolutely Kosher. 

Two tour EPs followed in late 2005 and early 2006. In the summer of 2007, Get Him Eat Him released their second full-length album Arms Down, co-produced by former Dismemberment Plan guitarist Jason Caddell.

In February of 2009, Get Him Eat Him released their final EP The Throat Is Bent, and played a farewell show with Kleenex Girl Wonder at Brooklyn's Union Hall. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Get+Him+Eat+Him">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
