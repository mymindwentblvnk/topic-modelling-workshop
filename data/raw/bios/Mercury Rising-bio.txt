2.-MERCURY RISING is a progressive metal band originating from the Baltimore, Maryland area. Their music, while firmly rooted in hard rock and progressive rock, shows complexity and various metal influences, thus being a progressive metal band.

Their debut album "Upon Deaf Ears" showed their potential as a progressive band, with a 9 minute closing epic that will appeal to progressive rock and metal fans. Their second album titled "Building Rome" perfected their formula, and was a very solid album, and is highly recommended.

They will appeal to fans of melodic progressive metal, and fans of RUSH, KING'S X, and even DREAM THEATER.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mercury+Rising">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
