Courtsleet is hands and thoughts at desperate times underpinned by unspeakable disquiet, navigated foggily through an impasse of identity; residuum of portentous woes. Gavin Turner finds a safe haven scrutinizing and eulogizing distant objects and wishes he could tote his sublime mental refuge through celebratory music, but instead pens songs about emotionally disarming topics of self-sabotage. From 2007 to 2012 he was a musical ingredient in the notorious A Forest of Stars. Courtsleet debuted in 2012 with demo “Beyond Being” and returned in 2014 with EP "Hope's Apparition" which is to be released physically as a split with Of Solitude and Solemn's 2014 EP "Starlight's Guide". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Courtsleet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
