BIO
Into The Divine was born around 2010 when the guys were in middle school. After a few additions, the band settled in with Cole and Michael on guitars, Wesley on bass, Jay on drums, and later on Wilson on vocals, making the band a five piece. Into The Divine shaped their unique sound from a metalcore band, to becoming a heavy, hard riffing, and melodic death metal band, pulling influence from not just metal, but multiple genres. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/into+the+divine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
