BIOGRAPHY

Band was formed in the beginning of 2006.
At that time Jone and Jussi were planning
to create studio project that wouldn't do any
live gigs. But soon the idea turned into
Stained Blood.Jone was the former of
the band and is still sole tyrant of it.

Jouni,Jaakko and Antti were the first to
join the band.
In a way that was good because
Jone had previous experience playing with
them and guys are wacko. So that was only
the natural way to do things.

In the beginning of february 2006 Jussi joined
the band to be as a lead vocalist.Thoughts
about the studio project were buried.RIP.

In february 2006 SB started recording their first
song "In Search Of Myself". At the sametime
promoshootings, for these pages and upcoming
demo release, was done.

Currently SB has 23 song ready.

But still the band is currently recording  new songs, 
while arranging for gigs.
