THE ANCIENT are a blackened deathcore band hailing from Michigan. After forming in early 2010, The Ancient have quickly become one of the elite metal bands in the state. A Frozen Path EP was released in April to critical acclaim and many live performances followed.

The Ancient quickly gathered a cult following and caught the eye of a few prominent labels. Finally, the right home was chosen and the contract was signed. Look for a label announcement and new album details to follow very soon...
