Bright Color Vision was conceived in 2006 in London, Roehampton. After some HR-related instabilities related to the hunt for the perfect vocalist, the band’s line-up was finalised. We have been active for almost two years and for a year now we have been gigging regularly in London’s music venues and pubs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bright+Color+Vision">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
