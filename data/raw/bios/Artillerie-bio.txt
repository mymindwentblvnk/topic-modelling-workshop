Artillerie is a five-piece, thrash/metalcore band from New Delhi. Originally formed in 2004, it was briefly known as Frozen Flames before being renamed as Artillerie. The band has seen its share of unprecedented line up changes and hibernation but now armed with a brand new line-up and a newer sound, it has begun to increase its presence through gigs and competitions. The band has also recently recorded their four track EP called New Offensive which has been making rounds on the internet and has been released as a part of a 4 way split compilation by RSJ . Currently the band is working on new material for a new album which it intends to make available by sometime next year.
 
Most of Artillerie's songs are written from a first person perspective, and revolve around a constant theme of "God’s raging anger against the abuse and manipulation of man by man through legalistic and lifeless religious ideologies, political & social apathy, war, and increasing commercial exploitation, especially amongst the youth today, when He intended man to be free and complete in the identity He created him in”. 

The band has recorded their new album at Grey Studios in Delhi and is all set to release it by june or jully for 2010 under the Grey and Saurian Record Label. 
The Album titled "Eradefiled"  is a concept album, the story of which can be followed at this blog www.artillerieblog.wordpress.com <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Artillerie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
