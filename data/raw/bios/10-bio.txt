The avant experimental duo '10' is 'Marqido' from Japan who is a laptop noise artist, and 'itta' from Korea who plays real voice, toys, melodica, accordion and miniature traditional instruments of some nations. Simple and of many of layers, noise and lyrical music, electronic and acoustic music. "10s music began from that irony" 10's 'one' and 'zero' cannot meet, but they can include each other. 10's music started from that irony. 10 started from the relationships of irony, and 10 can make ironic sound. Their very names are ironic in that Itta is the Korean word for 'exist (1)' while for Marqido, 'Maru' means 'eternity' and 'zero (0)', 'qi' means 'delight' and "do" means "angry".
