Flanger is:
-Atom Heart playing Rhodes, Motion Bass/ Programming
-Burnt Friedman playing Gretsch Drums, Percussion/ Programming

The Flanger project was founded in 1998 by Uwe Schmidt (aka Atom Heart aka Se√±or Coconut) and Bernd Friedmann (aka Burnt Friedman), who have both been active in the music business since the early 1990s.  

The two musicians met up to program their first album "Templates" in Santiago de Chile in 1998.  Their musical goal was to generate their own vision of non-repetitive, organic and extremely complex music that is far removed from the well-trodden paths of techno and other established styles of so-called contemporary music. "Templates" was released the following year on Ntone/Ninja Tune, together with separate 12-inch pressings of several tracks. 

The success of this debut album convinced Flanger to do a second LP, which was recorded in Santiago de Chile, in March 1999. Entitled "Midnight Sound", this was released on Ntone/Ninja Tune November 2000. The release of "Midnight Sound" prompted Uwe Schmidt and Bernd Friedmann, who are renowned for their very special shows, to consider the idea of live Flanger presentations.

Although their Fall 2001 Tour was recently postponed, they are still planning a series of live appearances around the world. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flanger">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
