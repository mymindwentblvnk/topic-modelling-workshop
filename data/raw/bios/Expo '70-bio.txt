EXPO '70 was formed in Los Angeles by Justin Wright as a side-project, while he was playing guitar in Living Science Foundation (Second Nature Recordings; GSL50 Compilation). Initially, the group also included Wright's friend, PK . The pair improvised creating sounds bouncing effect-ridden instruments creating a wide range of textures and moods. EXPO '70's first recording and inception was during PK's project SXBRS recording session, resulting in one of many split releases on PKs'  label. After playing two shows (with Parts & Labor and Tyondai Braxton respectively), they ventured back into the studio. “Live July 18, 2004” was recorded with the help of Bryan Levene /artist]), and recalls the spirit of the Taj Mahal Travellers improvisational drones.

Returning to the midwest upon the breakup of LSF, Wright began developing EXPO '70 further, collaborating with McKinley Jones of the Kansas City-based Cantus Firmus. The pair recorded “Surfaces” in late 2005, adding synths over improvised guitar tracks pieced together by Jones. In February 2006, Wright completed “Exquisite Lust”, his first fully-realized vision of EXPO '70. “Exquisite Lust” collects improvised guitar tracks that shift through pleasant melodies, warm and harsh textures, while overall remaining somewhat minimal. His most recent effort, “Center of the Earth”, pushes dense and heavily-layered drones, with a rich, organic feel.

Expo '70 is currently based in Kansas City, Missouri and has begun performing live. All releases to date have been issued on PKs /label] label, released as limited CD-Rs, designed and hand-packaged by Wright himself. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Expo+%2770">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
