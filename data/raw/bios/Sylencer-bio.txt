Sylencer is an American Thrash Metal Band founded in Chicago, Illinois by lead guitarist/vocalist, Markus Johansson and bassist Johnny Rox. They formed the band after meeting on Megadeth's message boards and bouncing around ideas.  They officially formed the band in 2006 and spent six years painstakingly recording the album. After numerous economic hurdles, they released their debut album, "A Lethal Dose of Truth" independently on their label, Sylencer Records, on September 4, 2012.
