SIRCLE OF SILENCE, a Los Angeles based Hard Rock outfit, was fronted by former SACRED CHILD, ACCEPT and BANGALORE CHOIR vocalist David Reece. Guitarist Larry Farkas previously played with the Christian Thrash band VENGEANCE whilst drummer Jay Schellen's history tracked through terms of duty with BADFINGER, THE BANDITS, STONE FURY, WORLD TRADE, UNRULY CHILD and HURRICANE. 'Talk To Myself' and 'Words Get Lost' on the first James Barton produced album were originally songs co-written by Jay Schellen for UNRULY CHILD's proposed second album. AUTOGRAPH singer Steve Plunkett featured in the co-writing credits to eight of the album's twelve tracks. SIRCLE OF SILENCE issued a second album, 'Suicide Candyman' again produced by James Barton, in 1995.

During 1995 Reece would contribute guest lead vocals to two tracks on former DARK LORD guitarist ALEX DE ROSSO's eponymous debut album release. In 1998 Jay Schellen formed up HEAVEN AND EARTH alongside former HURRICANE band mate Kelly Hansen and guitarist Stuart Smith. Schellen later performed on the 2000 AIR PAVILION album. The drummer hooked up with Prog-AOR veterans ASIA in August 2005.

Both 'Sircle Of Silence' and 'Suicide Candyman' were re-issued as a double disc set in November 2007 by Escape Music Ltd.
