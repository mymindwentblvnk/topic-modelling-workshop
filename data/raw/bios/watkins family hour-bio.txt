Watkins Family Hour is an American bluegrass musical collaborative led by Sara Watkins and Sean Watkins (formerly of the progressive bluegrass group Nickel Creek). The group began in 2002 as a monthly, informal musical variety show with the Watkins siblings and their friends in the Los Angeles nightclub Largo.

For the singer-songwriter-multi-instrumentalists, the Watkins Family Hour has long been an oasis from the rigors of the road, a laboratory where they can try out new material or master beloved cover songs. Their monthly show at L.A.â€™s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes.
