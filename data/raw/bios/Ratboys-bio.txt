Ratboys are an American indie rock band from Chicago, Illinois formed in 2010 by Julia Steiner and Dave Sagan. The band consists of Julia Steiner (guitar, vocals), Dave Sagan (guitar), Marcus Nuccio (drums) and Sean Neumann (bass, vocals). 

Founded by songwriters Julia Steiner and Dave Sagan during their time studying at Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, the band relocated back to Sagan's hometown of Chicago in 2015 and released its debut album AOID that same year on Topshelf Records. Neumann joined the band as full-time member in 2016 and Nuccio joined shortly thereafter in 2017. The band released its second album, GN, in 2017 and began gaining notoriety while touring with other rising acts like PUP, Soccer Mommy, Diet Cig, Wild Pink, and more. Rolling Stone named GN one of the “15 Great Albums You Probably Didn’t Hear in 2017,” while Uproxx rock critic Steven Hyden named the album one of the best albums of the year.

Ratboys released its third studio album, Printer’s Devil, in 2020 to more critical praise. MTV called Printer’s Devil “the best album of their career,” while Pitchfork hailed the album's depth as “comforting and sobering all at once.
