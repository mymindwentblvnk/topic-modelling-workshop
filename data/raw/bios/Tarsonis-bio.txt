Tarsonis is a two man black/death extreme metal band from Hiram, Maine. Tarsonis have dubbed themselves 'Starcraft metal' after the popular computer game Starcraft. Their lyrics also deal with Starcraft and their music often contains cut scenes from the game. 

They released their first EP, The Fall of Antiga Prime, in 2008 and are recording material for a second. They are currently unsigned and looking for a label.
