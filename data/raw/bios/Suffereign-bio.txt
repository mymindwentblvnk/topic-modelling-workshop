Suffereign is a Technical Death Metal band from France. They formed in 2002 by drummer Alain (Organ Harvest (Fra), Selenim, Krazumpath), Arnaud (Guitars) and bassist Florent  (Organ Harvest (Fra)). The group plays very medium brutal death metal mixed in with technical riffs and sectors of excellence with peircing drumming skills, harsh vocal performances and damaging riffs. Their influence is clear throughout their well performed and producded recordings of which they most influence from bands like  Suffocation, Disgorge, Severed Savior and Decrepit Birth.

The band started by releasing a demo in 2002 simply called "Demo 2002", which composed their drilling atomsphere and beautifully connected riffs and interchanges within the music. This was self-released and was limited in copies and after this quickly was sold out the band already had some songs to put another demo out. This time it was called "Embryoworms" which featured most of the songs from the last but two new songs, which had more copies than the previous. Again this sold out unexpectally quick for the band. 

However, it wasn't until the band parted ways with some of the band members until the 2004 "Miasmic Germs" was unleashed into the public domain. Then this lead to a label signing with Revenge Productions. They then worked on and recorded a five-track EP called "Secreted Insanity" which had remarkable showing and reviews across europe and america. However, the band coping with other intrests and bands decided to keep the band on hold for awhile. As the guitartist Arnaud is re-settling to america. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Suffereign">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
