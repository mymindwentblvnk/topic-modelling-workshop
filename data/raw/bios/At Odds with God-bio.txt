The roots of this Melodic Black Metal/Melodic Death Metal act date back to 2002, when guitarist Diego Montoya and drummer Dario Camacho from Fort Lauderdale were writing the original tracks to four of the total seven songs on Earning Damnation.
Due to lack of time of some band members, Montoya started looking for other musicians to pursue his vision and soon there was an unnamed quartet consisting of Montoya, guitarist Alejandro Maya, bassist Rob Stokes and drummer  Moises Lujan formed in 2003. With new name - At Odds With God - the band went trough a few vocalists until they found German/US sound engineer and visual artist Nina Saile in 2004.
Saile rewrote some of the lyrics in the existing songs and even created two new songs. At Odds With God accomplished to release these songs as 38 minutes long debut album Earning Damnation in 2007 under their own label At Odds With God Records. Although the album was positively received by both internet critics and magazines, it remained unnoticed by bigger labels and majority of fans.
At the beginning of 2008 the original drummer left the band and Carlos Linares (Glorious Death) joined.
At Odds With God started to write and record new songs in 2011, the second album should be released in autumn 2011.
