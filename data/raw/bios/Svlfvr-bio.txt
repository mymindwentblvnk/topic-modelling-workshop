SULFUR is a Doom-Metal band with extreme metal influences born in Autumn 2011 with Morcar (ex-Funeral Marmoori) on bass, Dionysos (Rexor) on vocals, Asmodeus (Rexor) on guitar and Black Wizard (Domine, ex-Necromass) on drums.

The first Proof of this unholy communion is the "Seeding The Astral Mark" EP, released in spring 2012, containing the first 5 songs of the band for a total length of more than 30 minutes.

After the first show and some divergences within the line-up, Morcar and Black Wizard left the band shortly after the Ep was released. Thorns (Frostmoon Eclipse, Deathrow, Manetheren, ex-Glorior Belli) and Dysangelium (Rexor, Sickening) replaced them to fill the line-up in June 2012. 
Due to some musical discrepancy and new responsabilities Thorns left the band in the last month of 2013. 
After 6 months of consideration Dionysos and Asmodeus decided to carry on with the band; the new official drummer is Poseidon (Dead Soul, Rusty Nails, Alcolica) while Atomik Bahnhof from Sofisticator is adding his energy for the upcoming summer gigs!
The band is actually working on the compositions for the new album.
