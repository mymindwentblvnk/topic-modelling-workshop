Cordolium (translated from Latin as heartfelt grief or sorrow of the heart) is a young one-man project from Russia. It was created in the southern part of the Urals, in Chelyabinsk by Ivan Saprykin. However, recently the project has relocated to St Petersburg. 
In June 2012 Cordolium released the first EP entitled “December”, which was produced, mixed and mastered by Emily A. Saaen. She is mainly known as a singer-songwriter and guest vocalist for various bands (such as Íon, The Eternal, Manes and others).
EP “December” consists of three atmospheric metal songs containing some really magnificent vocals and vivid, spectacular music inspired by such bands as Anathema, My Dying Bride, Amorphis, Lake of Tears and Empyrium.
All lyrics written by Ivan Saprykin.
All music composed by Ivan Saprykin.
