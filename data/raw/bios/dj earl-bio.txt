South Side born Earl Smith, one of the youngest members of the Ghettoteknitianz crew has been part of the footwork culture before he even hit his teens. Cutting his teeth as a dancer for the Creation Crew, he eventually tried his hand at making music and was taken under the wing of DJ Rashad and DJ Spinn who taught him the fundamentals of how a track is made. Yo can catch him cutting his records at almost all of the weekly battles that go on in the city of Chicago.

In March 2013 he released his new EP Blue Summer for the LIl Pitch Records including a remix by The Host AKA Boxcutter. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Earl">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
