The end result of a musical and spiritual development going years back in time, Cwealm – as an active musical project – was founded by Astraeus in 2014.
Bored with a life devoid of sinister creativity, Astraeus took stock of his situation and began to give concrete form to the echoes of his inner wrath. A journey started where revisiting old classics (Mayhem, Dissection, Burzum, At the Gates) led to the composing of seven occult hymns and, finally to the recording of his first full length album, Odes to No Hereafter in 2015-16.
Guitars, bass, keys and vocals were laid at Studio T4 Berghof (Gothenburg, Sweden). With the help of longtime friend Gabriel Lugo Méndez, drum programming was the next crucial step, but the aim was always to get a real drummer. Thanks to Tore Stjerna, contact was made with Jocke Wallgren (Amon Amarth) who nailed the drums with full force at Necromorbus Studio (Stockholm, Sweden) where the album was subsequently mixed and mastered.   
A core concept for Cwealm is – and will always be – misanthropy. Aimed as a tool to spread hatred for mankind and promote the worship of death, the project embraces the incisive credo of E. M. Cioran: ​
