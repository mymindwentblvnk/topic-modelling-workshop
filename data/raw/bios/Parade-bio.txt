Parade were a British five piece pop girl group from U.K. Formed in 2010, they were signed to Asylum Records. The five girls are: Sian Charlesworth, Lauren Deegan, Jessica Agombar, Bianca Claxton and  Emily Biggs. One of the girls, Sian, was a former member of another girlgroup called City Girls. According to the Louder Songfacts, Emily was previously a member of the six-piece girl band Hope, who were finalists in the 2007 series of  The X Factor. Their first single "Louder" was released on 13 March 2011 and it peaked #10 in the United Kingdom and #41 in Ireland. "Perfume" was their second single. In 11 November 2011 the group released their debut album, Parade, which failed to chart on the Top 100 of UK's Official Charts and they were dropped from Asylum.

On 11 July 2012, through their official blog, they announced "Light Me Up" as the first song to be posted online from their new album. It was released as a free download on 1 August 2012. On 11 February 2013, it was announced through the group's Twitter account that Claxton had decided to leave Parade, and that as a result, the other members had decided not to continue as a group. They also revealed that they were unsigned throughout 2012 to 2013, after being dropped by their record label in 2011.

2) Parade's only agenda is to play music they love. Through a highly collaborative process, they create their own version of pop music: melodic and minimal, but classy and modern. They draw from influences as varied as Radiohead, Mark Kozelec, PJ Harvey, Gang of Four, Aphex Twin, and Nick Cave, though it is rare to find them listening to the same recordings at the same time.

Parade essentially began in Emily's living room in Athens, GA, in early 2004. Since Jason lived in Atlanta, GA they commuted between the two cities to practice. Although school and jobs eventually led them to settle in Atlanta, Parade is inspired and affected by the sounds of both cities. As such, they consider themselves a product of both Atlanta and Athens.

Over the past two years, Parade's sound has grown in sophistication, but retained its listenability and charm. Parade released their first EP, The P EP, in April, 2004, and in August 2005, they released their first full length, A Red Button. Both were independently released. In May 2006, Parade released "Penelope Shoes" as a split 7" with fellow Atlanta band Aviator. It is distributed by Stickfigure Distro and released in association with ISP.

On stage, Parade is energetic and tight, but honest.

Having honed their live show in Atlanta and Athens, Parade plans on hitting the road in fall 2006 to spread their music all along the East Coast.

4) Parade is a musical that opened on Broadway at the Vivian Beaumont Theater on December 17, 1998 with a book by Alfred Uhry and music and lyrics by Jason Robert Brown. The premier was directed by Harold Prince and closed 28 February 1999 after 85 performances.

The closing of the show was not because of the quality of Parade, but was due largely to the charges of the fraud against Garth Drabinksy, and the ensuing bankruptcy of Livent, the company producing Parade.

The show garnered 9 Tony Award nominations and won two awards, for Best Book of a Musical (Uhry) and Best Original Musical Score (Brown).

The show was received very coolly by the public and some critics, many of whom felt the show took too many liberties when it came to the use of racial slurs in the show. However, Brown was praised unanimously for his score.

The UK premiere ran from August 5th to the 28th at the Southside Theatre as part of the 2005 Edinburgh Fringe, playing by the end of the run to packed houses and standing ovations.
