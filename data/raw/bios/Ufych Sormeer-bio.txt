Ufych Sormeer is a French epic thrash symphonic heavy metal band founded in 1997 by Olivier Bourez (guitar/vocal), Fabien Waquet (guitar/keyboards) and Nicolas Sanson (bass), three natives from the northern lands of the Kingdom of France. Permanent bad weather and desolate landscapes logically led them onto the way of Metal music.

The band learned to play, like many others, by doing covers from Metallica, Slayer, and so on... After that, they tried different styles: they began by old-school heavy metal, then trash metal, then death, and even black metal. At that time, they added Keyboards to their music, obviously influenced by Bal-Sagoth. After that, Jérôme Pawlowsky joined them, first as a keyboard player, then as a drummer, replacing their former one who was disappointed by the evolution of our music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ufych+Sormeer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
