The dictionary defines Revolución, or Revolution, as a radical transformation in any order.  It is from this definition that this band from the island of Puerto Rico takes its name. They began in 1996 as a group of friends that got together just to play music for fun, and they have been doing that ever since. This power trio is made up of Miguel at the vocals and guitar, bassist Delio and drummer Julio.

Revolución is mostly influenced by early 90's alternative rock bands and other groups that remain active to these days, such as Queens of the Stone Age, System of a Down, Metallica, Weezer and a few more.

Though they are from Puerto Rico, they have played in other places, such as New York, Florida, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and others. They remain very active to this day and released an album in 2009 called "Y". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/rEVOLUCION">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
