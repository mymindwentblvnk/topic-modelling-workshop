There are 3 musical groups that use the name "Mesto".

1. EDM producer from Netherlands.

2. Mesto is a group of friends from Wilmington, North Carolina. They make sweet jams.

3. MESTO was established to combine the traditions of many ethnic musical genres and those of Western classical traditions.
Los Angeles lends itself as one of the most logical choices of cities to host this unique orchestra.

Speaking from a musical perspective, MESTO focuses on fostering new genres of musical expressions that combine the essence of non-European traditions; namely, styles of music based on ethnic scales and rhythms.

The makeup of MESTO is within the scope of usual Western norms. Traditional ethnic (folk) instruments are incorporated with the symphony orchestra. Precedence for such arrangements has occasionally been established in the Far East, Asia, Latin America and many other parts of the globe. We wish to bring this tradition here.

Historically, symphony orchestras have employed non-Western instruments in compositions based on non-Western traditions. These innovations and deviations from traditions were written primarily by Western composers and performed for a Western audience.

MESTO collaborates with distinguished composers and performers from within the specific cultures.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MesTo">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
