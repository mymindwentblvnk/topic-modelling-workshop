Death the Leveller formed in 2016, when Ger Clince, Shane Cahill and Dave Murphy looked to start a new project following putting their previous band, Mael Mórdha, on hold. They were joined by kindred spirit Denis Dowling (formerly of Cursed Earth) on vocals.

Inspired by the Death-doom scene of the early 90s, Gothic rock and a variety of other diverse sources, Death The Leveller’s influences combined to produce epic and introspective.

The band’s name derives from the poem, ‘Death the Leveller’ by James Shirley (1596-1666) and reflects the band’s desire to write music that faces the reality and mystery of life and death, without morbidity or fear. Their music seeks to explore the possibilities offered by a fleeting lifetime, with acceptance of the inevitability of death and the futility of seeking permanence in our earthly achievements, save only the possibility of the memory of righteous actions.

Debut track “A Call To Men Of Noble Blood” released on the 30th May 2017.  Taken from the bands self-titled EP released on the 12th June 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+the+Leveller">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
