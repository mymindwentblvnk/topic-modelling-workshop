Far & Son is a Swedish Hip-Hop duo consisting of Frej Larsson (Slagsmålsklubben, Maskinen) and Simon Gärdenfors (Las Palmas). The duo has released three albums "The Sushi USB EP" (2012), "Inte Inför Barnen! EP" (2014) and "Nya Friska Tag EP" (2015).

The duo has been part of a number of controversial acts. In september 2015 they built a gayclub, called "The Blue Oyster" on the land where Vladimir Putin has his summer cottage. They faced charges of 3 months in prison but that never happened, even though they themselves said that they where guilty. 

Later in 2015 the duo wrote in an open letter how they "payed $6000 to kill a Cambodian boy together". This was in relation to their musicvideo of "Dubbel Margarita" being released, which was filmed in Cambodia in 2014. They got the offer from a tuktuk-writter to pull of the stunt. 

During a tour of an apartment, the duo started making an omelett on the stove to "make sure that it works, in case we would buy this 14 million SEK apartment".   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Far+&+Son">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
