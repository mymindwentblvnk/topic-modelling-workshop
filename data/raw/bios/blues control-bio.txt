Blues Control is Lea Cho and Russ Waterhouse - a keyboard, guitar, and tape music duo.

After two years of making new age music as Watersports, Russ and Lea played their first Blues Control show in 2006.  They have since toured in North America, the UK, Japan, and Europe; playing galleries, living rooms, museums, discos, and DIY venues.  They've opened for Animal Collective, Cluster, and Henry Flynt; written and performed an alternate soundtrack to Lewis Klahr's Five O'Clock Worlds; played for third graders in Oakland; and were the inspiration for Octavius Neveaux's 2009 solo painting exhibition at Cinders Gallery.

After several cassette releases, in 2007 Blues Control put out their first two full-length records: Puff (Woodsist/Fusetron) and Blues Control (Holy Mountain), and in 2008 they put out a 7" of holiday music as part of Sub Pop's Singles Club.  In the summer of 2009 they released their third record, Local Flavor (Siltbreeze), which featured contributions from Kurt Vile, and placed high on many critics' year-end lists.

Blues Control are currently working on a collaborative record with Laraaji for RVNG Intl, and a new full-length record. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blues+Control">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
