Misdeed was an Estonian Death metal band formed in 1992. Their first demo was a 2-track demo called Mortification of the Flesh, only to become a track in their first and only album Diabolism (1993).

Unhappy with the band line-up; they without the haphazard tendency split-up in 1995 after there was a discrepancy with the guitarist named 'Till'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Misdeed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
