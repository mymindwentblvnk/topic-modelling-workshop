The Entrance Band is an American psychedelic/stoner power trio based in Los Angeles that emerged from a Guy Blakeslee solo effort originally known as Entrance.

Since the Tee Pee Records release of 2006's heavy, stoned stomper Prayer Of Death disc of Entrance, frontman Guy Blakeslee inducted drummer Derek W. James and A Perfect Circle/Zwan bassist Paz Lenchantin into the group. The Entrance Band released its album, The Entrance Band, via Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Entrance+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
