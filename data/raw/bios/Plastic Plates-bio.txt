Plastic Plates is the deejay/producer alias of Felix Bloxsom, the Sydney, Australia wunderkind who has seemed to have appeared out of nowhere with amazing remix productions for the likes of Adele, Mark Ronson, The Human League, Empire of the Sun, The Magician, Body Language, Sia, Midnight Juggernauts and I Blame Coco. After his remix for Adele’s “Set Fire to the Rain” was hand-picked by Stephen the Magician to lead off his Magic Tape Ten; Plastic Plates’ crisp production talents were thrown into the spotlight. His remixes have also shown up on mixtapes for Aeroplane (Adele remix), Mustang (Sia Remix), and even made second appearances for The Magician (Body Language remix). His summer wrapped nicely with high profile remixes for The Human League and The Wombats, and his fall has begun with his remixes of both Mark Ronson and The Magician being released on the French label Kitsune. With remix and gig inquiries pouring in left and right from all over the world, one has to ask from where this fine-tuned talent came. Well, his day-to-day work as a studio drummer and session musician, where he has recorded for the likes of The Presets, Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros, Daniel Merriweather, Empire of the Sun, Sia, Sam Sparro, Christina Aguilera, and Jamie Lidell, certainly hasn’t hurt. While the name Plastic Plates may be new, Felix is by no means a novice to the music world, and when the dust clears from all his remix releases this summer and his original material is released this winter, everyone will know that neither Felix nor his alias Plastic Plates are going away anytime soon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Plastic+Plates">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
