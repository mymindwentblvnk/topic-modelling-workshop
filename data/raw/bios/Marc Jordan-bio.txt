Marc Jordan (born 1947), is a multi-genre Canadian musician known both as a songwriter and session musician for other artists, and as a singer in his own right.

Born in the New York City, New York district of Brooklyn, the son of Canadian singer Charles Jordan, Marc grew up in a musical household in Toronto after his father returned to Canada. He studied filmmaking at Brock University, but he soon turned to music; he first came to public attention as a guitar player for Bobby Vee.

With the Canadian division of CBS Records, Jordan released some singles in 1974 (titles: "It's a Fine Line", "New York Kids", "Original Sin"). They were not very successful themselves, but they impressed American music producer Gary Katz, and in 1977 Jordan reached a U.S. deal with Warner Bros. Records. This period with Warner would spawn the Canadian hit songs "Marina del Rey" and "Survival" from the record Mannequin and a second record with Jay Graydon producing called Blue Desert (released 1980). This recording is a classic of the "West Coast Sound".

In the 1980s, Jordan was signed to RCA. For two records, Paul Devilliers, produed the first Talking Through Pictures and Kim Bullard the second called C.O.W.. In 1988 Jordan sang and co-wrote the theme song to the hit Australian movie Boulevard of Broken Dreams which was nominated for an AFI Award for Best Film. In 1993, Jordan was signed to EMI/Blue Note. His records Reckless Valentine, Cool Jam Black Earth, This Is How Men Cry, and Make Believe Ballroom were much more jazz-oriented. Many of his older recordings have also been re-released.

Jordan is married to fellow singer-songwriter Amy Sky. They live in Toronto and cottage in the Muskokas with their two children.

Jordan and Sky are both national UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors for Canada. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Marc+Jordan">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
