How it all started : Left Among The Living is a 5 piece metal band rising from Sandvika, Norway, a small city just outside it`s capital Oslo. L.A.T.L have been around for about 5 years, mainly playing in and around the Oslo City area.Currently unsigned, L.A.T.L has a 7 song, self made demo recorded between dec. 2003 and jan. 2004 which you can order by e-mail -->leftamongtheliving@hotmail.com Our sound is a violent assault on the hearing senses, a twisted mix of aggresion and melody, with brutal screaming and growling vocals. Lyrics dealing with everything from war, fleash eating zombies, the apocalypse and self destructive inner thoughts. With no particular style, We are influenced by death and thrash metal with a little touch of hardcore. L.A.T.L`s live performance is a tight energetic force of brutality.
