dEEd is a Swedish groove and heavy metal band formed in the spring of 2007 in Stockholm, Sweden. The band is comprised of lead vocalist Emma Fredriksson, lead guitarist Olof Gustafsson, rythm guitarist Carl Åbjörnsson, bassist Mikael Carling and drummer Mathias Roitto.

The band members has influences from all kinds of music and leaves it up to you, the listener to decide which genre applies, but you can summarize it all by one simple rule: Every riff, every chord and every melody can fit, as long as it sounds cool and is fun to play. In a world full of over-produced pop music, dEEd is the opposite of just that..

dEEd released their first EP called "Starfucker" in may 2010. The band has had a few line-up changes, the first setup (MK I) included singer Daniel Saidi. After a few months guitarist Carl Åbjörnsson joined the band. After a few years, Daniel decided to leave the band and was replaced with Emma Fredriksson, who merged right in with the band after the first rehearsal together. dEEd is currently at MK III and intend to stay this way :)
