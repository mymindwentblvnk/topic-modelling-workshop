There are two bands with the name JAEGER
www.myspace.com/JAEGERSOUND
JAEGER is musician and producer, hil jaeger.
trained as a classical pianist and composer, the ever growing howl of
this decade's electronic music making, remixing and remaking led her
into the the world of digital sound waves and scapes.
on a continual passage to capture the guttural sounds she feels, and
charged by the ever increasing ability to mold, make and filter sounds
waves, she is behind the making of, recording and mixing of each
instrument, sound and voice in the songs.


Jaeger Rydall was born in August 1995.  He was well known on Youtube as Galipoka for his Jaegerr Reports.  Unfortunately, in July of 2007, Youtube deleted the Galipoka account because of a Terms of Use violation.  Galipoka then made another account, Galipoka555.  Unfortunately, Youtube also deleted this account.  In June 2008, Jaeger created the account TemporaryGalipoka which was again deleted.  Jaeger plans on returning to Youtube in August 2008.  Most of his songs are just for fun and nothing too serious.  Jaeger passed away in April 2020. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jaeger">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
