Disintegrated started back in 2007 where the goal was to create a band that played death metal like back in the day. They released in January 2008 their first demo entitled Murdered In A Clinic. After one and a half years with concerts and songwriting, they were ready to get back in the studio in July 2009 to trackZ studio in Krus√• and recorded their first full length CD entitled This Is Art. This Is Art proves how the band has turned into a pure mid-tempo death metal machine, neck breaking heavy pieces, with a whole lot of technical groove. Disintegrated proofs on this record that they keep old school death metal alive without so much crap! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Disintegrated">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
