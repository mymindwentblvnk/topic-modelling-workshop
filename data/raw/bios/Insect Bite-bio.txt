Formed in 2009.
Splatter Thrash band made in Tokyo JAPAN
The old school crossover tune into which the B rank horror movie taste was poured is placeg by the cult thrash!
It's a lost child of a Japanese music scene. 
A Thrash in Tokyo was dead, so a member change was repeated.
HIROX of a scrap guitarist joins in spring of 2010, and it'll be the construction of the band now!
When forming, ASUKIX was vocal with guitarist and was 3 pieces of style of a band.
ASUKIX will be a player only of Vox, and Creap show of blood and MOSH is developed!
5 strings of bassist KEIJIROH grew up by Venice sound.
Drummer TARMAN, it's a lefty guitarist even before half year.
The music each member hears goes cross over, and it's this band.
I think I'll get both of MOSHER and HEAD BANGER to ally on my side, and makes Japan a Thrash scene.
I want a horror movie sound, S.O.D.,THE ACCUSED, and 80's EVIL THRASH to ask a favorite person by all means. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/INSECT+BITE">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
