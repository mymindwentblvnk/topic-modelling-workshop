Born in 1979, on Belo Horizonte - Southeast Brazilian metropolis - Samuel Parrela aka Menorah was introduced to the electronic music production process in early 1996. In 2001, caught by the veteran producer, Dudu Marote aka Prztz, he was requested to release two tracks for the electronic music compilation “COMP_01|02 Orgânico|Sintético”, that gathered the 23 most important Brazilian artists on a double cd, with 29 tracks.

Requested to perform live acts, his presentations are always filled with a smashing experimentalism influenced by Jazz and Detroit Techno. With a deep minimal approach to the dancefloor, Menorah is building electronic dance music as it is meant to be: in constant search for creativity in its architecture. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Menorah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
