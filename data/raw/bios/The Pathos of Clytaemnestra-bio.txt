Hailing from Connecticut(US), The Pathos of Clytemnestra was formed in early 2006 by three friends: Will, Brian and Geoffrey. They wanted to play metal for metal's sake, only seeking to please themselves, and those who enjoy their music, without ever seeking to change to satiate those who don't. Recruiting their friend Don to play bass, they began working on their first songs. After searching for a full time drummer for few months, Shane contacted them and the first full lineup was completed. Around the same time, Will decided to pursue his interest in Grindcore, eventually forming Hip Cops. With a need for a new guitarist, The Pathos contacted long time friend Opton from Revelations of Doom to come play guitar.

After rehearsing for close to a year, writing new material, and reworking some of the original material with the entire band, The Pathos finally felt their songs were ready to be heard and entered The Rock Shop to record a 4 song demo, which was released in early 2007. Since then, Don has parted ways with the band and was replaced by Mike, formerly of Soul Shroud. With this new lineup, The Pathos has reached another level in songwriting, pushing themselves to develop their sound to its fullest potential.

The Pathos of Clytaemnestra has been playing shows in Connecticut and New York, but is still more concerned with refining their sound and writing more material. In the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes, "Alas for those that never sing,?But die with all their music in them!" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Pathos+Of+Clytaemnestra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
