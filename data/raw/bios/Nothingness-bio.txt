There are two bands with this name:

[1] nothingness was born in 1996 and have always been embracing heavy music into their own. Based in Santo André, in the Greater São Paulo area, they are about to release their first album - The Inner Fear.
The concept for the CD came up from the idea of recording the tracks in a straight and raw way, using anything it was available at the time such as recording the drum tracks in an abandoned pub, recording using home digital audio devices, using weird mics and home made instruments
