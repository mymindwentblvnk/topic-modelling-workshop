Helms Alee is a Seattle three-piece formed in 2007 by Ben Verellen (Harkonen, Roy, These Arms Are Snakes) and is completed by Dana James and Hozoji Margullis.

The band combines heavy rock with melodic arrangements and seems to have an ear for excellent composing. All members of the band exchange lead vocals duties and occasionally teams up for harmonies.

After having released their self-titled and one-sided debut LP on small labels, their full-length debut Night Terror was released on HydraHead in August 2008.
