Caecus ("Kai-sus", formerly known as Empyrean) focuses on merging atmosphere, technicality, and diverse (yet accessible) progressive elements to bring a unique and refreshing sound to the extreme metal genre. The Champaign, IL-based quintet recently released the debut EP "Aesthesis" and intends to continue creating their art at a juggernaut pace.
