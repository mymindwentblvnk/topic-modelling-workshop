Moray Eel was a band from Russia founded in 1998. The music of Moray Eel is hard to categorize, with elements of alternative metal, thrash metal and metalcore. The highlight of the band is unusual female vocals of Kate Moray ranging from “clear” singing to harsh “screaming” and “growling”.

In September 2008, on a live show, Moray Eel announced that they are breaking up. They briefly reunited in 2009, but only for a concert tour.
