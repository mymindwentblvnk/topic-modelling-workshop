Animula is 20 year old Melbourne artist Ryan Allgoods current musical project. Latin for ‘piece of soul’ or ‘life’, Ryan’s music is inspired by the natural things around us & human emotion. Combining smooth ambience with glitched synths and drum sequences, the aim is for the listener to feel surrounded by dense textures and melodic layers, forcing them to visualise a story behind each track & connect with the music. Animula has a constantly evolving sound & as time passes it will continue to do so.
