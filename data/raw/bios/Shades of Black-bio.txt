Currently run by Matt Zuleger as an instrumental djent, progressive, arabic, metal project. SOB started back in 06' when Shawn Andrews and Matt Zuleger wanted to start a band. They were never able to get a band together so the project was left to Matt in which it became an experimental instrumental project. My sanctuary lies within my creations. Only there am i truly free. The ultimate expression of my soul lies within my music. My sanctuary.
How to describe my music? Technical. Djent. Arabic. Epic. Heavy. Interesting.
I try to set my music apart from the rest of the crowd. The songs are also instrumental as well, which allows me to write them in an extremely unique fashion, usually following no real structure.
