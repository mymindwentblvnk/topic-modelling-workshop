The hordes of Cross Denied came out from the depths during the 2003 year A.B. During summer of 2004 they recorded the first demo,called "Desecration Of Mankind" (never released).After that,the bandâ€™s musical direction changed into extreme black metal tunes.So in the summer of 2005 they recorded their promo-cd.There have been some serious changes in the line-up during the past 2 years and the new members added brand new elements upon the flesh of Cross Denied. The band is currently working on new stuff and the result will be the upcoming album entitled "christ The Propagator-Mental Genocide" a genocidal blackmetal manifesto of hatred!!
