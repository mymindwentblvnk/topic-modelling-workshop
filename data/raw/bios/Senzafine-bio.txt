Senzafine provide a Frankenstein-like stitching together of sounds, with the aggressive Biohazard-influenced riffing of bassist Joe "Lev" Cassidy (ex-Psyko Dalek) and grunge-tinged melody of guitarist / lead vocalist Graeme Humphrey (ex-Temptation's Wings) tempered in the fine tradition of such bands as Life Of Agony and Helmet by the solid rock drumming of sticksman Craig Chapman.

Aiming to finally put the evolution of crossover / alternative metal back on the track it was on before the nu-metal trend derailed things in the late-90's, Senzafine provide something a little bit different for you when the knuckle-headed blastbeating of today's metal and constant chugging breakdowns of today's hardcore all start to blend together.
