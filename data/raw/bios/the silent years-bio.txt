The Silent Years are straight out of Detroit, Rock City! The DIY band created all of their own artwork, website and they even hand made their stunning debut video clip for “Someone To Keep Us Warm.” 

Heavily influenced by Elliot Smith, Jeff Buckley, Flaming Lips and Sunny Day Real Estate, the Silent Years’ are combining sweet-as-candy melodies with eardrum-piercing, full-on noise. Adding to the intrigue was the multiple tempo changes and playful dynamics that were delivered like an amusement park rollercoaster.

The band has played previous dates with Mellowdrone, French Kicks, Sound Team, Akron Family, The Processions, Stars Track and Fields, Aqueduct and The Fields.

To help round out their sound, vocalist Josh Epstein recently enlisted the help of keyboardist and violinist Cassandra Verras, drummer Ryan Clancy and bassist Michael Majewski.
