There is more than one band named "Collapse"

1. Andika Surya Buana, a singer-songwriter for critically lauded hardcore/punk/metal band  from Bandung, Indonesia A.L.I.C.E, founded Collapse out of the ruins of forgotten riffs, poems and melodies that did not suit his current band. Even so, Collapse stands independently for its own, it has always been intended to be and last its lifetime.
