1) Dekadent is a Black Metal band from Slovenia, formed in 2005. Dekadent evolved from a side-project called Vigred (meaning Spring in their native language), led by Artur Felicijan. When all members of the current line-up joined, the group decided to continue their work under the name Dekadent.

Formed in 2002 as Vigred, the band recorded several demo tracks throughout the years, while their first full-length promotional album was recorded in 2005 and was entitled Manifestation of Seasonal Bleeding. The record received very good response from local underground press as well as from Metal media abroad and Vigred were subsequently signed to a Swiss Black Metal label SMP. At this point they changed their name to supposedly more internationally acceptable Dekadent.
