Behind the mysterious name HVME (pronounced like the English "Hume") stands a young producer born in Murcia, south-east Spain. In 2016 he started with his first productions, which musically move between Future House, Slap House and Deep House. His international breakthrough finally came in 2020, when his track "Goosebumps", which was released on the label Lithuania HQ, went through the ceiling.

By the way, the artist's name is an abbreviation of his civil name, in combination with the name of the Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711 -1776), with a "V" replacing the "U". HVME has been the nickname his friends once gave him years ago. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/HVME">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
