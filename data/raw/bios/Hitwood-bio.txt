These melodies are all featured on the album "When Youngness... Flies Away..." that's essentially a musical compression by 10 years of dreams.
The project has started in 2007 in Italy and it's heavily influenced by the Melodic Death Metal scene and some post-rock/shoegaze stuff. Suggested to all fans of In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, Paradise Lost, Drudkh, Pelican, Agalloch and Alcest. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hitwood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
