Formed in 1993 or 1994 under the name Zahrim. Recorded one demo, which was rehearsed over three weeks and recorded in one, and was never fully mixed. In 1997, it was re-released under the NME name by Sevared Records. 

The two original members of the band, Kris Norris and Ryan Parrish, also played in Disinterment (melodic black/death metal from Richmond, Virginia) and later earned fame as members of the melodic death metal band Darkest Hour.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/New+Millennium%27s+End">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
