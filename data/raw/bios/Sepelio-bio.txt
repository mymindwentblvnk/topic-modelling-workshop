SEPELIO

August 2, 1998 the band put out their first demo called "Cazador de Almas" (Hunter of Souls). The demo demonstrates the band's potent Thrash/Death style, with a little bit of 80s Heavy Metal influence. The demo was recorded in the basement of the FENASTRAS Auditorium in two days with the help of other bands and consists of 6 songs, which were some of the first original songs the band wrote and have been perfected since then.

The Songs are: -Psicogenético -Necropolis -Depredador -Letargo Mental -Cazador de Almas -Sepelio

A Mexican Company is distributing the demo in Central America, South America and Mexico.

This band was formed in 1991. The line up has changed since 91 until the core of the band was formed in 1992 with Leonardo Ayala (drummer) and Rubén (guitarist). Their first show was held at the Auditorium of the University of El Salvador opening for THRASH, METALDOOM, and SEPULCRO (these bands have since disbanded). Since then the band has played with other Central American and Mexico bands like : TRAUMA (Honduras), MANTRA (Costa Rica). FOETICIDE (Mexico), CENOTAPH (Mexico) and also opened for MASTER (USA) when they played in El Salvador back in 1998. The bands main influences are: Slayer, Sepultura, Metallica (early), Death and Megadeth. The band states there song lyrics are in the same vein has there song "Psicogenético" (Pyschogenetic) which talks about an "environmental degradation".
