Mortes Vivendi is a german Heavy Metal Band from Hattingen (NRW). It was founded in November 2002 by Manuel Krusy (Guitar, now Fireset Project ) and Sebastian Schröder (also Guitar, Kogure today). The same day Jonarthan Krusy (Bass, Fireset Project  today) and Fabian Bäcker (Vox, also Fireset Project  now) joined the band. It was completed by Manuel Sieling (Drums, Polaris today) some weeks later.

In 2004 Isabel Breiter joined the Band to create more harmonical variation with her Keys.

Early in 2005 Sebastian Schröder left Mortes Vivendi and was replaced by Benjamin Oszfolk. Ben played guitar until Isabel left the Band in Summer 2005. From that day on Ben started playing the Keys.

In Autumn of 2005 Mortes Vivendi released their first EP "Dawn on Earth". It was recorded without Keyboards, because it was recorded in the changing times, when Isabel left the Band.
Dawn on Earth is a classical "back to the roots"-Metal record , that sounds pretty much like Black Sabbath in the Osbourne days.

2006 was a year of songwriting, rehearsals and live Shows. The idea of a dystopia, inspired by Huxleys "Brave new world"  came up. Recording for the concept album "Strange World" (working title) started.

In early 2007 Manuel Sieling had to leave the Band, for he had to move to Northern Germany. The other members decited to bury Mortes Vivendi and take now paths in music.
