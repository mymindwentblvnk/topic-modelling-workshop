Preferring a more intimate solo concert style, Shiotaka performs regularly in halls and salons. He also performs in historic, culturally significant locations, often  linked with the biwa, including the sacred Kumano and Koyasan areas, as well as Itsukushima Shrine and the Akama Shrine at Dan no Ura.
