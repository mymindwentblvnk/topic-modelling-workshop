From the great experience in national and international brutal scene, during the month of August 2012 sees the unholy light a new creature called DEVANGELIC formed by members of Putridity, Vulvectomy, Coprophiliac, Indecent Excision and Necrotorture with the intention to play the most brutal Death Metal possible inspired by US brutal GODS Disgorge, Condemned, Gorgasm and more. An hard process of de-composition sees the band working between September and Octorber 2012. During the month of November the band enters the 16th Cellar Studio in Rome (Hour Of Penance, Blasphemer, Fleshgod Apocalypse and more) to record two promo songs "Indulgence For Butchering" & "Unfathomed Evisceration". Now this brutal combo are writing new songs for the first album, planned for the end of 2013 beginning of 2014, and are in search for a serious label that can promote the project everywhere in the world! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Devangelic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
