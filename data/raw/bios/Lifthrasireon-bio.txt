The word "Lifthrasireon" is a symbiosis of "Lifthrasir" and "Aeon". According to the Edda, Lifthrasir is the father of the coming race, which will rise after the Ragnarök, the twilight of the gods. "Aeon" is a greek word and means "age". With the name "Lifthrasireon" and my music I want to conjure up the age of Lifthrasir, the dawn of a new aeon. With my view of music I am representing exactly what will define this new aeon: Lifthrasireon stands for the quest for the musical expression of Teutonic heathendom and beliefs, it transports handed down folkloristic moods by modern metal music and modern instruments. This is representing what the future could look like: a new-aeonic heathendom. If Europeans set out on their quest for their old beliefs, the heathen religion of their ancestors and long past forgotten spirit, they will be able to combine tradition and modern age to a new-aeonic heathendom. As I am expressing traditional nordic moods by modern instruments, we all could express our ancient beliefs by modern art at all! The new aeon is nothing predestined, it is what we want to be it, and my idea is to make a new beginning by remembering our roots. That´s Lifthrasireon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lifthrasireon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
