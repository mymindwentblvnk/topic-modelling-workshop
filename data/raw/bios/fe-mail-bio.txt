Fe-mail is a noise duo consisting of Maja Ratkje and Hild Sofie Tafjord, both known from the anarchistic improv quartet SPUNK (founded in 1995). But Maja and Hild have played together already in various constellations since 1993, and had their debut concert as a noise duo in Tokyo 2000. Since then they have spread their sonic inferno around the world. Fe-mail's music is electronic music based on improvisation with live sampling as well as recordings of their own generated sounds and field recordings, however always with focus on their main instruments which are voice (Maja) and French horn (Hild). Their music is also characterized by the use of old fashioned, analogue electronic and acoustic sound sources, found objects and electronics side by side. Fe-mail's debut album was a pink vinyl "Syklubb fra Hælvete", released by two students in Oslo. This was picked up and re-released on Important Records in 2004, and Fe-mail's success accelerated beyond expectations. Since then Fe-mail has been heard and seen at stages and festivals all over Europe and North America. 

Fe-mail's main project besides the duo is a collaboration with the Swedish dancer Lotta Melin in a trio called Agrare. In addition to that, Fe-mail has collaborated/are currently in a collaboration with Enslaved, Wolf Eyes, Jaap Blonk, Matmos, Massimo Zu, Lasse Marhaug, Ikue Mori, Otomo Yoshihide, Carlos Giffoni, Ingebrigt Håker Flaten, Paal Nilssen-Love, Kjetil Møster and other people from the N collective as well as the Norwegian artist Per Inge Bjørlo, choreographer Odd-Johan Fritzøe, the opera singers in 'Opera i Tiden, choreographer and dancer Maja Delak, x-drummer Manheim from Mayhem and Øyvind Berg from Baktruppen. 

In 2007 Fe-mail started a new collaborative band with members of Norwegian metal band Enslaved called Trinacria. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fe-mail">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
