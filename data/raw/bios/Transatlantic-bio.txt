Transatlantic is a progressive rock supergroup founded in 1999 by Neal Morse of Spock's Beard and Mike Portnoy of The Winery Dogs and Liquid Tension Experiment and formerly of Dream Theater. Other members include progressive rock veterans Roine Stolt (The Flower Kings) and Pete Trewavas (Marillion).

Daniel Gildenl√∂w (Pain of Salvation) provided backing vocals and played guitar and keyboard during the 2001 tour.

After releasing two highly acclaimed studio albums and two live recordings they disbanded in 2002 mainly because of Neal Morse's decision to start a Christian rock career.

In 2009, Transatlantic made the surprise announcement that they would get together again and record a new album. The double disc new album, titled The Whirlwind, comprising of a single 77 minute song and a second cd including 4 original recordings and 4 covers, was released in October 2009.
