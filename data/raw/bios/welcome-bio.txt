Hailing from Seattle, but arriving seemingly out of nowhere, Welcome are both distinct and familiar, at once drawing the listener in, and suggesting worlds of possibilities. An essentially traditional line-up of guitar, bass, drums, dual (often double-tracked) vocals, and a couple of guitars (admittedly augmented by some unconventional home made pedals and FX), they manage to wrench or coax new shapes at will. Formed over ten years ago, Welcome have taken their own time to find their voice, making allowances in their schedule to accomodate other bands, projects, and a lengthy hiatus, before returning with newfound focus. Having undergone several line-up changes, the band appearing on ‘Sirs’ comprises Jo Claxton (bass, vocals), Jon Treneff (drums), Pete Brand (guitar, vocals), and Mike Wurn (guitar).

Impulsively absorbing, subverting and recontextualising an alternative pop lineage peculiar to them, Welcome’s sound is melodic, and rhythmically and sonically ambitious, their music sitting somewhere between the fractured, exploratory idealism of 60’s psych pop (The Creation, Syd Barrett’s Pink Floyd, Revolver-era Beatles) and such non-conformist US alt-rock luminaries as Unwound, The Breeders, or Deerhoof. In fact this is barely the tip of the iceberg - their inspirations running from Kool Keith to Harry Pussy and beyond.

Welcome was also a band from Edmonton, AB who released a self-titled album in 1996.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Welcome">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
