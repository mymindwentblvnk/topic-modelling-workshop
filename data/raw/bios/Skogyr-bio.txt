Skogyr is a one-man band founded in Velikie Luki, Russia in 2005 by Farakh. The main intention was to create instrumental music filled with the atmosphere of solitude and longing, the music inspired by the grandeur of the nature landscapes and mysterious woodlands. The first self-titled demo was recorded in 2006 and released in small amount of copies in early 2007. In summer 2007 Skogyr signed a deal with BadMoodMan Music (sublabel of Solitude Productions) to release the debut full-length album titled "Rainchants". The music on the album can be described as melancholic heathen black metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skogyr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
