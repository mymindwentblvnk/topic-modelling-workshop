The Softies refers to two bands:

(1) The Softies were Rose Melberg and Jen Sbragia, who both sang and played guitar. They recorded somewhat-wistful love songs mostly consisting of nothing but their two voices and gently intertwining electric guitars. Rose Melberg was in twee bands Tiger Trap, Gaze and Go Sailor; Jen Sbragia was in Pretty Face and is also in All Girl Summer Fun Band. The Softies disbanded, and since then Rose Melberg has pursued her solo work, while Jen Sbragia continues with All Girl Summer Fun Band.

(2) The Softies was a Dutch punk band that released two singles in 1977/78, one of them, Suicide Pilot, featured on Killed By Death #1234 compilation. They also released a full-length LP entitled Nice And Nasty. They performed with Captain Sensible (after he left The Damned) on one 7", covering the gay punk anthem Jet Boy, Jet Girl. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Softies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
