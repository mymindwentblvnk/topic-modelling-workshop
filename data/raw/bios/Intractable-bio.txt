The Thrash Metal Command Intractable in 2006 by Dominik Meier (guitar) and Benjamin Kottmann (drums, vocals) was launched. A rehearsal room has been set up and the first songs written. A few months later, Mark Hospenthal (guitar) joined the band. He brought a slightly different style and therefore fresh wind. It has been working around and around again produced more songs. 2008 Michael Schuler (bass) has been hired for the bass sounds. Several singers were hired, which unfortunately had to leave the battleship after a short time. 2009, we made ​​novel Emmenegger (vocals) a Christmas present by the mic in his hand and roared our ears deaf. Intractable was finally complete. Licked at first stage blood, Intractable can no longer stop by! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Intractable">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
