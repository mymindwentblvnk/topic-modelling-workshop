Various artists share this name:

1.) Son of Man, a hardcore/punk/metal bedroom project based out of Los Angeles, California heavily influenced by Integrity, Converge and Buried Alive.

From those placid efforts, we 4 dreamers took on the task of forming a new, more vivid and exciting project, we called it Son of Man. Its good to see that the ideas that we had about our existance havent changed, we still exist to show the demons we once held so close to us that we are no longer an entity that cowers at the thought of loss, but one that will embrace it only to acheive more.

We are as soft as rose petals, and as hard as bullets, we dont like to change minds or influence dreams, we just like to make music that you can dance and cry to, punch and die to!!! We are three mexicans and a white boy who love to get down and we want you to jam out with us!!! Thank you to all of the people like you reading this and supporting what we do, it's all for you!!!!!
