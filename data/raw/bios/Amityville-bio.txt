Amityville started as a duo involving ex-Geneva singer Andrew Montgomery and former Poppychain guitarist Stuart Peck in London, in about March 2002.
The two wrote songs for about a year before enlisting David Bevis (drums) and a succession of second guitarists and bass players, none of whom stayed around long. 
They released the EP 'Pacific Radio Fire' (named after the Richard Brautigan short story of the same name) on their own label, Comedown Records, in July 2004. It garnered some great reviews from the likes of Claire Sturgess (who made it her XFM single of the week) and Drowned in Sound music site. The limited run of 1000 copies sold out.
However the band struggled to keep going (in part due to issues over personnel), and in spite of briefly settling on their best line-up (Montgomery, Peck, Bevis and ex-Serafin and Catherine Wheel bassist Ben Ellis), they played their last gig in May 2005.
Montgomery has gone on to collaborate with Keris Howard, formerly of Harper Lee and Trembling Blue Stars on the project st famous, while Peck is now a member of The High Wire. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amityville">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
