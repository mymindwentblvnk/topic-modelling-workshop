Ayat are a straight up raw, anti-human, chaotic, black metal band from Beirut, Lebanon. A force governed by reverend Filthy Fuck and mullah Sadogoat.

Band statement: "We never described ourselves as anti-Islamic black metal. We are against the religious establishment in all its forms and Islam is just one form of it." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ayat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
