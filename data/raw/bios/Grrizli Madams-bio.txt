Grizzli Madams is a Slovenian metal band. Active in the 2003-2006 period as a thrash metal band, they reappeared in 2010 sans vocalist, their style having evolved into instrumental heavy-noise-alternative rock/ metal. The band released their first EP, V vrtincu vsemogočnega miru, on ZARŠ - the label of Ljubljana's Radio Študent. They are preparing new, yet untitled full lenght, which is already recorded and planned to be released in april 2012.
