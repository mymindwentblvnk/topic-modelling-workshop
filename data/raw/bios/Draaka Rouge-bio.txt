Draaka - Rhythm, Lead, Acoustic Guitars, Bass, Keyboards, Drum programming

Draaka Rouge is an aural and spiritual exploration of the darkness within and beyond the human mind created in the autumn months of 2011. It is an artistic choice to be solely instrumental to portray sonic passion void of the human voice, and to leave open interpretation of the sounds and energies put forth in each individual piece.
The goal of Draaka Rouge is to express music in a pure and dedicated art form to inspire and progress dark creativity in all forms. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Draaka+Rouge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
