Sacrilegious Throne is a Blackened Metal act focusing on creating big evil music that you can sink your teeth into. Crushing riffs, demonic vocals and pounding percussion lay the foundation for a dynamic hell ride into the unknown. 

Hailing from East Anglia, England they take a variety of clear inspirations for their music including Opeth and Dimmu Borgir and utilize these reference points to create a very solid and very listenable type of black and death metal. Solid production and efficient playing are a keynote throughout both EPs so far produced by this band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sacrilegious+Throne">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
