There are two bands under this name:

1) Southern Storm was a heavy/progressive metal band from Tuzla (Bosnia and Herzegovina). The band was founded in December 1998 by Dario Havel and Damir Sinanovic, former members of Postmortem. Shortly after, they were joined by Emir Hot , who had recently left Neon Knights. Emir and Southern Storm parted ways in 2003 due to Emirâ€™s other obligations. He was replaced by Samir Sinanovic.

Adnan Omerovic, former Grotesk bass guitarist, had to leave Southern Storm after a year for personal reasons and was replaced by Mario Vilusic, the ex member of Neon Knights. For quite some time Southern Storm was lacking a lead singer. Nevertheless, first songs were recorded. Elvis Garagic, then the lead vocal of Dugi Put, gave it a try and they were a perfect match.

The music style of Southern Storm in the early stage was defined as melodic heavy rock with progressive and ethnic motives. Later they used to say they play "Heavy" as their music was influenced by bands that have one word in common, and that is "Heavy". The music was created in a modern way, using ethno motives that are melodically and rhythmically characteristical of the surrounding area.

Southern Storm released one studio album named 1999. They were preparing to record another album when the band suddenly fell apart. To this day there are no indications the band might reunite.

2) There is also a RAC band from Sydney, New South Wales, Australia that shares the same name. Formed in 2002, they have released the following three albums: "Suden Sturm" in 2003, "Stormtroopin'" in 2004 and "It's Time to Get Revenge on Our Enemies" in 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Southern+Storm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
