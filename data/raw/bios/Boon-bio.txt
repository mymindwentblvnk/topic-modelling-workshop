Boon is the Moniker of Washington D.C. based musician Brendan Principato. 

Principato grew up in Rockville Centre, New York where he developed a penchant for atmosphere and texture. His first official release "A Salon Of The Refused: Vignettes and Meditations From Our Youth" grew out of old audio recordings that Principato had taken on his cellphone over a span of years. The name Boon comes from the short film "It's Such A Beautiful Day."
