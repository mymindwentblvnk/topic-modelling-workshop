In Silence is a one-man hobby project from Budapest, Hungary, experimenting with diverse musical styles ranging from ambient to progressive metal. Being an instrumental project based on synthesizer and electric guitar sounds, the titles of the songs often refer to the original inspiring sources, e.g., "Childhood's End" (based on the novel of Arthur C. Clarke) or "Silence - A Fable" (a short story of Edgar Allan Poe). Since the "band" does not aim for commercial success, the songs are likely to remain streamable and downloadable from Last.fm for free. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+Silence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
