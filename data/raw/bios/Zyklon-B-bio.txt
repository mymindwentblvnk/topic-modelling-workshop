There are five bands known as Zyklon-B. 

A. Black Metal Project from Norway with members of Emperor, Satyricon and Dødheimsgard. Their only release was a Single with 3 tracks and 10 minutes playtime (later re-released with a bonus remixed track). Very fast, aggressive and atmospheric tracks about war, violence and depopulation of the earth.

Members:
Samoth: Guitars (confusingly, also a member of the completely unrelated band, Zyklon);
Frost: Drums;
Draug Aldrahn: Vocals;
Ihsahn: Keyboards.

The soundclips on the track "Warfare", are taken from Bob Larson's show "Talk back", with Boyd Rice as a guest on that particular one .

B. A punk/hardcore act from Quebec, Canada, which released an EP entitled "Death to Nazi Scum" in 1982.

C. A hardcore band from Gijón, Spain

D. A post-punk band from the Netherlands who had three tracks on a sampler tape from the Dutch fanzine 'Binnenlandse Ontwikkelings Hulp,' or 'BOH.'

E. A noise project from Novosibirsk, Russia. Up to date it has released one record - "Rokovaya Assimetriya" ("Fatal Assimetry").

F. A short-lived Death Metal band from Thornton, Illinois. Released one demo in 1988: Gorenography <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zyklon-B">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
