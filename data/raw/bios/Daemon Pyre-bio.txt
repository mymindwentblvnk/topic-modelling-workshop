Death metal 5-piece Daemon Pyre from Sydney, Australia have smashed their way onto the heavy music scene with the release of their eponymous debut album.

Formed from the ashes of the much respected As Silence Breaks, the band are a seasoned team of musicians with a number of national and international tours under their belts and an album that, before it was even released, was voted number 4 on Adelaide Radio’s MOSH Listener’s Poll off the back of their single, "Misanthropic Parallels” alone which has also received extensive national airplay. Tracked and produced by Shane Edwards (Northlane, Thy Art Is Murder, Arteries, Death Audio) and mastered by Jens Bogren (At the Gates, Soilwork, Amon Amarth, Kreator, Opeth), the album contains 11 brutally progressive, riff-heavy tracks that are unrelenting from start to finish. Daemon Pyre also features a guest appearance by Jason Peppiatt of leading Australian death metal act Psycroptic on the final track, "Darkened Perceptions".

With extensive tour plans Daemon Pyre will be working hard to get their music and their crushing live show out to as many people around the world as possible. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daemon+Pyre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
