Since early 2002, two minds with the darkest pasts gathered to bring out war and blasphemy from the very depths of their souls.....the Hellish Throne arises. Holding no patterns and musical boundaries, but paying tribute to the true metal gods (Bathory, Mayhem, among others) Khaos 666 and Filheim III entered the studio to write and record a genuine Black Metal piece: ”The Book of War- Tales of forthcoming battles for the Throne”. First impressions.......Slashing head-banging riffs, thundering war-calling drums with a spontaneous old school feeling, all turned into unholy Black Metal music. Played with hateful spirit and bloodstained hands. After some enthusiastic, highly-rated press reviews and rewarding fan reactions over The Book of War release, the band felt challenged to write new material, continuing to explore widespread resources for musical influences in order to craft a unique sound and personallity for the band. Some rehearsals, casualties and storms later, the candles are burning again, flashing the face of the dead...revealing the soundtrack to the fall of man.... The forthcoming awaited 2nd release "Light a Candle For the Dead, And a Torch to Burn Their Corpses" expects setting a milestone in Hellishthrone´s history as a genre defining album taking the band itself to a new level, even spreading it´s message of hate to broader extreme metal audiences.
