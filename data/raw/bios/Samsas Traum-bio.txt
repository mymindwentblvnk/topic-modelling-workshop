"Samsas Traum" was evoked in 1996 by Alexander Kaschte as solo-project, resulting from his incapability of working together with other musicians. Having performed as vocalist and guitarist in several Black-, Death-, Doom- and Melodic-Metal-Bands before, he decided to walk his own paths, to step forward into the wide fields of darker electronic and neoclassical music.

The first demo-tape "Nostalgische Atavismen" sold more than 500 copies in the worldwide underground, slowly spreading the news that "Samsas Traum" someday might become more than a very strange little band with even stranger german vocals. After recording and releasing two more demo- and promo-tapes, the band signed their record deal with "Trisol Music Group Germany" (London After Midnight, Sopor Aeternus, L'Ã¢me Immortelle) on the 1st of march 1999, exactly three years after the bands foundation. The chief-manager of "Trisol" got to know about "Samsas Traum" randomly; he was phoning "Orkus Magazine" concerning adverts, and the person in charge listened to the bands' latest promo-release while talking to him.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Samsas+Traum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
