Destend is a metal band from Sydney that was started as a project in early 2008 by Charbel Ayoub, and branched out from there. With heavy thrash influences, the riffs where brought to life as the band came together in the following months.

Each member bringing their own style and influences has shaped the sound into something new, different and unique. With the fusion of fast riffs and groove based beats, Destend has produced some intense powerful material.

In February 2009, Destend entered the studio to record what would become “DEMOlition”, a three-song demo that captures the intensity, power and unique brand of metal Destend has to offer, a demo set to demolish anything that comes its way. 

As of April 2009, Destend parted ways with their vocalist/rhythm guitarist, Clint Lovering.

In September 2009 Destend found a new singer. They are currently working on writing and recording new material to be released soon.
