THEE KVLT OV OUROBOROS is a doom and black thrash influenced Florida band that formed in Gainesville, FL in 2005 with people who were members of such bands as E.B.S., By The Horns, Apollo Quartet, I Can't Remember, etc.  Using only bass guitars, drums and vocals, THEE KVLT conjured up a heavy, low register drone sound that also whipped into blastbeats and thrash riffs.  Currently recording as a one-man project as most members have moved away from Gainesville. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thee+Kvlt+Ov+ouroboros">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
