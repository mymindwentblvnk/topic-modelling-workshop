1. Awaken is a heavy metal band from Greenwich, CT formed in 2009 by vocalist Glenn DaGrossa.  He was formerly the songwriter and founding member of the power metal band Lazarus, which Kerrang! magazine hailed as "one of the quintessential metal bands of our time."  Thanks to DaGrossa's soaring vocals and stellar song craftsmanship, Lazarus was also voted one of 2007's best unsigned bands by the staff at Germany's Heavy magazine and metalexpressradio.com said their 2007 debut, Episode One, "could have easily been sandwiched between Queensrÿche's The Warning and Saxon's Innocence Is No Excuse."  In addition to DaGrossa (who has also written and recorded with jazz luminaries Ernie Adams, Marchin Fahmee, and Hernon Romero, to name but a few), Awaken features an all-star cast of veteran New York musicians:

Scott Bennett (guitar, backing vocals) (Lost Legacy, The Lab, Present Darkness)
Joe Todaro (guitar) (Corey TuT, Smoking Buddha w/ Jamie Gustis)
Freddy Villano (bass) (Quiet Riot, Dee Snider's Widowmaker)
Nick D'Alessandro (Criss Angel Mindfreak, Earth Eatz Dog, Lazarus)

With considerable national and international touring and recording experience under their collective belts, Awaken is primed for the world stage and ready to lead a new wave of traditional heavy metal. Awaken debuted last summer by honoring one of their heroes with a blistering rendition of "I Speed at Night" on Magic Circle Music's Magic - A Tribute to Ronnie James Dio. According to metalpsalter.com, "Awaken cranks out a slightly faster version that allows the twin guitars to actually sweeten up the riffs." This summer, Awaken plans to throw down the gauntlet when they unveil their self-titled debut album, Awaken.
