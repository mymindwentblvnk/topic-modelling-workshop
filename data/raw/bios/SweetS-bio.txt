They competed against several thousand participants for the chance to be in a dance & vocal performance unit. 

After several months of training, they debuted on August 8th, 2003 with their 1st single: LolitA☆Strawberry in summer. After 2 mini-albums, 8 singles, 1 photobook, 2 DVDs & 1 live tour, leader Aki and lead vocalist Aya began a 6-month break in order to prepare for their entrance into high school.

The three member SweetS have released 1 single on the way ~Yakusoku no Basho e~ (on the way ～約束の場所へ～). Aki & Aya came back in March 2006 for the new single "Bitter Sweets" after having gotten into their top choice high schools after exams.
