Thine Eyes Bleed is a Melodic death metal band from Canada.

Formed in 2002 the band have gained a recognition from some followers of metal in recent years since its short reign. the band releasing their debut album, In the Wake of Separation, on The End Records, and touring for years with such allies as Soulfly, 6 Feet Under, and Kittie. Eventually being invited to play the 2005 Independence D festival in Tokyo, Japan and handpicked to fill out one of the most insane line-ups in heavy metal history, taking the stage with Slayer, Mastodon, Lamb of God, In Flames, and Children of Bodom on the Unholy Alliance Tour in the US and Europe in 2006, sparking such interminable praise as “America’s hottest new thrash property” (Metal Hammer) and “Canadian death metal that’ll make you puke” (Revolver).
