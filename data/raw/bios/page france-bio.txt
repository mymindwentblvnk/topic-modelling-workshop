(2004 - 2008)

Page France were an indie folk-pop music band. Their music tends to be emotional and their songs tend to have simple melodies. Page France is sometimes compared to Sufjan Stevens for their use of uncommon instruments such as the glockenspiel and banjo.

The band broke up in 2008. Frontman Michael Nau is now focusing his full attention on Cotton Jones.

The band has been characterized by some as Christian due to a number of references in song lyrics and titles. However, lyricist Nau counters: "The 'Christian band' inquiry wears me out, to be honest. As for the Christian symbols in my writing — sometimes I don’t even realize that they exist until someone points them out to me. There’s really no reason; it just rolled out that way."

The band is a frequent feature on a number of music blogs, notably You Ain't No Picasso. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Page+France">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
