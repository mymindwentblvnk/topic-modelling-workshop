Hemorrhage is a reclusive band that puts the music first and does not conform to typical music industry practices. The band has written & recorded 7 albums since 1994: In Trauma, JibberRich, Nepenthe, Wake Up, Gotcha Covered and Mainframe.

All material has only been released on their indie label Crippled Rich Music and is difficult to find as it has never been distributed & is only available from the band members. The only band member to have clear photos taken is of him is of Richie S.

The band shuns the public and concentrates on their music as an art of enjoyment and integrity. Hemorrhage has never played a public performance and currently has no plans to nor to tour. The band will record and release new material in the future when time allows from their other business interests.
