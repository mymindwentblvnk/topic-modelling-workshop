Jean, a future Brazilian popstar who is about to debut his first hit single "Entornar Você" late 2020 or early 2021 (or as soon as the Covid-19 vaccine drops). 

He is currently working on his first EP who is on the earlier stages of writing but is already shapping up to be a blockbuster, with songs spanning from brazilian-inspired rhythms such as axé and funk to 80s style Glam Rock and Heavy Metal, 90s hip-hop, R&B and synth-pop.

His biggest influences are: Madonna, Britney Spears, The Weeknd, Miley Cyrus and brazilian artists such as Pabllo Vittar and Ivete Sangalo. When asked about his preference for female artists he said: "Men in music tend to latch on to whatever is the trend at that point, which is where female artists excel at, which is expanding new ground both in music and with music videos and performing".

Born in the city of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, he grew up watching movies and playing video games, which he says inspire him on his songwritting.

He's first extended-play is set to arrive early 2021. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jean">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
