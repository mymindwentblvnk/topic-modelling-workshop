APATHEMY are one of Detroit's premiere hardcore bands, they first arrived on the scene in 1997 . Since their inception they have been destroying hardcore audiences all over the Midwest and Northeast. They have shared the stage with such prominent acts as Drowning Man, Darkest Hour, Disembodied, Poison The Well and Every time I Die (to name just a FEW!) APATHEMY s first CD, Our Decayed Remains was released on No Substance Records and debuted on the local Detroit Soundscan charts among such major label heavyweights as Sarah McLachlan and Veruca Salt. That being a mighty feat for a hardcore act with virtually nothing more than an independent label to back them up. Then a four song demo showcasing their latest creations found its way into the hands of TRIBUNAL RECORDS, and the rest is history. APATHEMY and TRIBUNAL RECORDS collectively are about to unleash one the most devastating metalcore releases in the year 2001 . Encased In Black This Is Forever is a full on metal assault. A dual vocal attack like no other, and enough metal prowess to silence all critics. APATHEMY have arrived and will now proceed to annihilate everything in their path. Upon release of Encased In Black This Is Forever APATHEMY will begin touring the country non-stop playing to hardcore and metal fans everywhere. It is only a matter of time, before the name of APATHEMY becomes yet another household name in the hardcore and metal communities.
