Formed in 2003 in Ieper, Belgium,
FATAL RECOIL combines the technique of Death Metal music
and the agressiveness and energy of Hardcore Music.

Early 2005, they entered Studio 13
to begin recording a demo-cd which sold out in no time.

So in the Fall of 2006 the band recorded their debut Mini-cd “Malicious”
at the infamous CCR studio with producer Kris Belaen
(ABORTED, CRIMSON FALLS, LENG TCH’E,…).

With this new record which came out on Rotten to the core Records
the band managed to forge a very solid fan base
in both the death metal- and hardcore-scene.

After playing more than 100 shows in the local area
the band unloaded another salvo in 2010
in the form of Stigmatizing the backslider,
their long-awaited first full length-album.

This album was also recorded and produced by Kris Belaen
and was released on the German Filled With Hate Records.

It was a tremendous step-forward for the band
on both the songwriting and production fronts.

Stigmatizing the backslider is the most ferocious
and memorable FATAL RECOIL album to date!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fatal+Recoil">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
