White Raven is a thrash metal band with lyrics spanning from sci-fi to horror.  The wings of the Raven began to flap over the  Hampton Roads region of Virginia in 2005 as a three-piece unit of ultimate-rockage.  The original lineup consisted of Chris Pelausa on guitar and vocals, Rob Corvin on bass, and Hew Woolard on drums.  Rob left the band in 2007 and was succeeded by Erik Holzer.  In 2006 the Raven began work on their demo/debut album "Trapped in the Devil's Toychest."
