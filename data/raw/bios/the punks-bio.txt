The Punks were an American rock band formed 1973 in Detroit, Michigan.

Influenced by bands such as The Underdogs, Unrelated Segments, Velvet Underground, MC5, The Stooges, SRC, early Alice Cooper, and Blue Cheer, The Punks represented the answer and contribution to the demise of the late great 60's era, especially in and around the Metro Detroit area.  After 1970 or so, the Detroit scene died, so the punks geared up and decided to make their own noise.
Guitarists Steve Rockey, Alan Webber or bassist Rod McMahon.  Lead singer "Frantic", a/k/a William Kuchon, took care of the craziness. Loud and aggressive music, fast and rockin', at times slow and heavy with nontraditional guitar interactions of feedback/wah wah/distortion mixed with driving bass runs and an atomic bomb relentless backbeat. They broke up in 1977. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Punks">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
