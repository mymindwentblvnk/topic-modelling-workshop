Gothenburg Grindsters RELEVANT FEW assembled in October of 2000, debuting live as support act to NASUM just two months later. A February 2001 demo session secured a contract with the Swedish No Tolerance underground label for the first album Who Are Those of Leadership?. A tour ranked alongside NAPALM DEATH was secured, but the band would be forced to withdraw when singer Johan Carlzon (ABANDON) quit the band due to several personal problems. Henke Svensson was recruited after a successful appearance at the May 2002 Fuck the Commerce V festival in Neiden, Germany. Drummer Moilanen bailed out upon completion of the sophomore album The Art of Today, issued in November of 2003, but made a return in December.

The November 2003 album The Art of Today would witness a swift re-issue through New Hawen/Century Media Records the following year. RELEVANT FEW opened for VADER s Gothenburg gig in August before uniting with GADGET for a run of the European Born To Booze, Live To Grind dates the following month. Short after the tour the band would act as support to DEICIDE on their November/December shows in Sweden.

A new chapter is about to be written in the book of the Swedish grindcore act RELEVANT FEW. The four-piece recently recorded 7 new tracks for an upcoming 12 vinyl EP and MCD, titled Hardening Black. They have also delivered some killer shows with the new line-up already, by supporting the likes of LAZARUS BLACKSTAR, GLOOMY SUNDAY and the re-united ATOMVINTER. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Relevant+Few">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
