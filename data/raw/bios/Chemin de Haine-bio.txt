French black metal band featuring past and present members from other established French bands such as: Osculum Infame, Kristallnacht, S.V.E.S.T., Seth, and Bekhira. Their name translates to "Path of Hate". Though the band has been active since 1994, they have yet to release a full-length album. They have appeared on 4 splits: two with Seigneur Voland, one with Grand Belial's Key, and one with Godless North. Though the band isn't explicitly National Socialist in its lyrical themes, some of the members that have come and gone have been from other projects with a more NS orientation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chemin+de+Haine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
