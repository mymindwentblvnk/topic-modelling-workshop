The Dirty Nil are Kyle Starchild Fisher on drums, Dave Motherfahkin' Nardi on the fuzz bass and Luke Bentham up front, playing guitar and singing AT THE SAME TIME. They hail from Dundas, Ontario, and make "smack-you-in-the-face" rock music. Grab your balls/place your hands on your ovaries and hear that rock and roll isn't dead.

As of late 2016, Dave Nardi is no longer in The Dirty Nil and in april of 2017 has been replaced by Ross Miller.
