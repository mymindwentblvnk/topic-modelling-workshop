Twinemen is a Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA band created by former members of Morphine and Face to Face. The group includes Dana Colley (saxophone / vocals), Billy Conway (percussion / vocals / sometimes acoustic guitar, also a former member of Treat her right), and singer and guitarist Laurie Sargent (lead singer / lead guitar). Various bass players, including former Face to Face guitarist Stuart Kimball, also perform with the band on the road and in the studio. Twinemen's music includes a mix of jazz, blues, acid rock, and lounge.

Twinemen chose their name as an homage to Morphine's late leader Mark Sandman and his The Twinemen comic series. The Twinemen depicted three anthropomorphic balls of twine who play together in a band. Twinemen currently records in their Cambridge-based Hi-n-Dry Studios.

So far, the group has released two studio albums. A third is currently being recorded and a number of live recordings of complete shows have been released through the Kufala label.
