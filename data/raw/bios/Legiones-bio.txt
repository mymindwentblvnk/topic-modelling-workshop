Name taken from the legions in, and around Jerusalem between the years 41 BCE to 410 CE 

Legiones joined ranks in 2007 as a three member band with Ruben Haug, Erlend Holm and Rune Holm, before Ole "Vargon" Nordsve joined our ranks to complete our demo released in 2009. Lyrics were taken from the old testament. Displaying the brutality and mutilations in religion.

Two years later, in 2011 Duplicate Records released a 7" EP with remaster of the two tracks Threat of Captivity and Against Judah. This was also released as a special limited book box in 50ex. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Legiones">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
