The Austrian Modern-Metal 5- Piece was formed in August 2006. The motivation for their own music was growing very fast and a lot of successful live-shows followed. They already shared the stage
with metal - monsters like Graveworm, Mnemic, The Sorrow, Nightrage and many more…

During 2007 the band collected a lot of experience and in september they recorded their first EP (released
in October 2007), which received great Feedback worldwide.

Also 2008 started quite successfull for the band and they have just released their new EP „Inner Circle“!
A head-smashing Modern-Metal-Must-Have! (Downloadable on itunes and more than 150 other Portals worldwide)

In 2009 Shadowcry will also appear on the Metal-DVD “Behind the suit and tie”
and on the “Soundtrack from Hell” CD (worldwide releases).

So, is there anything left to say?

Turn up the volume & Keep them in mind! They have just started to spread their shadows…
