Oakland, California, US (2009 - Present)

Started in December 2009, Jimmy, Eric and Alex wanted to play some grimy, disgusting and doomy death metal. With songwriting influenced by pioneers of aural filth like Hellhammer, Carcass, Winter, Impetigo,and Bolt Thrower. Brad joined on Bass in 2011 and the name Caffa was decided on shortly after. Plowing through themes of gruesome medieval castle warfare and the occult as an all-in-one steamroller of heaviness and atmosphere. 

The name stems from the first recorded site of chemical warfare, Caffa, where in 1346 the Mongols hurled plague-ridden corpses over the walls to infect the city from the inside out. Those who escaped by boat spread the disease throughout Europe and Africa; many attribute it as the primary launching point of the Black Death.

A year and a half of on-and-off practices brought the band to their first live show, with Blood Freak, Population Reduction and Mortuous on July 22nd 2011. In 2012, Chad joined the band on Drums and Alex our original drummer joined Eric on rhythm guitar.
