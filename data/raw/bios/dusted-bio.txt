1) After six years of constant Holy Fuck touring, Brian Borcherdt emerged from the tangled cables and broken drum machines with a slew of new songs. Looking to explore a different sound, Borcherdt teamed with drummer Leon Taheny and recorded in a converted garage under the name Dusted.. It draws on Women's tantalising, elegiac lo-fi moments; 'Candy Says'-era the Velvet Underground; and cavernous Microphones-style production, and a debut album was released through Hand Drawn Dracula / Polyvinyl in July 2012. The band is based in Toronto, Canada.

2) Dusted is the joint venture of two producers, Rollo Armstrong (Rollo Armstrong, who has produced New Order, Pet Shop Boys, Faithless) and Mark Bates (Guy Ornadel).
Their best remembered track was "Always Remember to Respect and Honour Your Mother Part One" (Go! Beat Records/Polydor Records) in 2001, which reached #31 on the UK Singles Chart. The song featured a 12-year old schoolboy vocal from Alan Young.
