Salt the Wound is an American deathcore band from Cleveland, Ohio. The group was founded September 11, 2001 by original drummer Jim Agrippe and guitarist/vocalist Mike Kawkabany. The band continued as a duo until the addition of Kevin Schaefer as vocalist with Vince Stropki soon to follow on bass guitar. Jake Scott was added as a second guitar player in September of 2005.

As the quartet grew in popularity they toured all through the tri-state area in support of their 2005 EP, entitled Bedsprings and Bloodshed. With gaining popularity the group has returned to the studio with the following lineup changes to record the follow up to the prior. Nick Cetrone formally of other local bands (Skinny Tree, Red Cellar Doors, Disingrace) has now stepped in to fill the role on drums made available with Jim's April 2006 departure. Vince has made the move from bass to guitar. This leads to Brian "Brooklyn" Martinez becoming bassist. 

Nick Cetrone played for a full U.S. tour while drummer Brandon Tabor (The Analyst) prepared for tracking Carnal Repercussions  and current member Rob Walters learned the set. After Carnal Repercussions was released,  Matt Wesoly became the new vocalist. The current lineup did several U.S. tours, several tours in Europe, and then released a second album, Ares, in 2009.
