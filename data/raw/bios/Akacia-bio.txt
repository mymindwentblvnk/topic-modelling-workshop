AKACIA is a progressive rock band that have never been afraid to play the best rock music, they are a group that simply do not sound as any another band, they follow the same musical line from the bands like GENESIS, YES, EL&P and KING CRIMSON. The musicians of the AKACIA use the common instruments found in any famous band, that they are the guitars, the keyboards, the drums and also the voices, very impressive musically and also lyrically, but in some passages, sometimes the arrangements are very complex, and in others parts are very simple.

Their music is heavy and very solid, also very gentle, also very soft, these kinds of the arrangements were easily found in the bands of years 70, a world that the listener has a feeling that we returned to the past. You can bet, AKACIA is certainly one of the most enjoyable bands that I will have ever the pleasure to listen to. Excellent and highly recommendable to all progressive rock fans.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Akacia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
