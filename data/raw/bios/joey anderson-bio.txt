Born and raised in Hoboken, New Jersey, house producer Joey Anderson created a buzz in the underground dance music world with his deep, spacy tracks that recall Detroit techno pioneers such as Underground Resistance as well as fellow cosmic explorers like Hieroglyphic Being. Growing up immersed in the early house music scene as a dancer, he began to teach dancing classes, and eventually began producing music, initially releasing tracks on DJ Qu's Strength Music Recordings during the late 2000s. Anderson launched his own label, Inimeg Recordings (named after his zodiac sign spelled backwards), in early 2011, debuting with a split 12" EP with DJ Qu, followed by one with Jus-Ed.After playing several underground parties in America, he made his European debut in 2012, appearing at London's Free Rotation festival. He also released "3200 B.C. House Dancer" on U.K. label UntilMyHeartStops and "Earth Calls" on American imprint Deconstruct Music. Anderson had a busy 2013, with DJ gigs around the globe, a mix CD on Japanese label Yygrec (The Era), and several 12" releases on labels including Latency, Syncrophone Recordings, and Anunnaki Cartel. The haunting, hypnotic "Above the Cherry Moon," released by Avenue 66, received the most praise, particularly from FACT, who named it one of the best tracks of the year. EPs on Sound Theories and Tanstaafl Planets arrived in 2014, as did Anderson's debut full-length, After Forever, released by Dekmantel. The album received critical acclaim as well, appearing on year-end lists from Resident Advisor and Rolling Stone. Anderson began 2015 with the 1974 EP on Dekmantel, and ended the year with Invisible Switch, a full-length on the same label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joey+Anderson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
