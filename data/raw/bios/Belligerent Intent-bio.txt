Belligerent Intent is a 3 piece black/death metal band from the northern suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria. With blasphemous lyrics combined with non-stop brutality and speed, Belligerent Intent is all out war against the laws of the cross and create this music for the like minded.

The 3 members met through playing in Flesh Embraced in 06. Flesh Embraced unfortunately would break up 12mths after forming. Craig, Mark & Matt would move on to form Belligerent Intent ( a band Craig had been attempting to form on and off for the last 10yrs since the passing of the guitarist Darren Rodeghiero) Writing 8 tracks in the first 12mths.

They also entered the studio and recorded there first 2 track promo for myspace which was released in jan 09, and finally released their EP Titled "Descending To Abaddon".

Moving along playing many shows and supports throughout melbourne over 2008 - 2010 has proved these maniacs are serious and dedicated to this music, and that they will continue to keep writing Unholy, Evil, Fast and Kaotic tunes for you to thrash you head to. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Belligerent+Intent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
