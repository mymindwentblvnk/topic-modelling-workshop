Seventh Section is a project from Canada which grew up during winter 2004/2005 by Carl-Keven Korb (drums), Nicolas Beaulieu (vocals) and Louis-Mathieu Tremblay (guitar). Many line up changes were done while playing in the first shows. Jean-Luc Gervais (ex-vocalist), Simon Tremblay (ex-bassist) and Nathaniel Boivin (ex-vocalist) joined and then left Seventh Section for personal and professional reasons. Then, Martin Boily (bass) and Keven Beaudin (guitar) joined to the band, forming a new five members band. A few gigs after, Nicolas left the band for professional reasons. A few persons were asked to replace him, without success, and at the beginning of fall 2007, Felix Gauthier Villeneuve (vocal) joined Seventh Section. After two years and many shows done with Seventh Section, Keven Beaudin left the band during summer 2008. A few talented guitarists were tested, but Kevin Fortin (guitar/ex-Morningless) was chosen. During August & September 2008, Seventh Section recorded its first E.P. named War Machine, with Charles Voho (Thalion). Seventh Section performed on stage 34 times and is working on upcoming gigs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seventh+Section">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
