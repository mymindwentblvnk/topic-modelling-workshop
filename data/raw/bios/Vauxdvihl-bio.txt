The Australian progressive metal band known as Vauxdvihl (originally known by the more conventional spelling Vaudeville) debuted with an intriguing album, with a darker and more adventurous tone. Their sound resembles earlier progressive metal acts like Queensr√øche, Lethal or to a lesser extent, Fates Warning. After that album the band (by this time a largely different lineup, with three of the original five members gone) entered an experimental phase, eventually releasing an EP entitled Vog, which by several reports is more industrial and not really a lot like To Dimension Logic. It seems unlikely that this band is still active. Former bassist Eddie Katz was recently seen in a band called Where Echoes End. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vauxdvihl">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
