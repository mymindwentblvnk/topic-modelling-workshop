The project ORNAMENTS OF AGONY raised from Mongolia, started in spring 2001. Albin was then very fond of Black Metal. So the band's initial direction would be Black Metal. Due to the lack of companions, the project long lingered inactive. But since autumn/winter 2001-2002 Albin decided that the musical style of his venture should be Doom Metal. In summer 2002, the project entered the active status and as of now released three demo tapes and one MCD. ORNAMENTS OF AGONY is still a one-man band.
