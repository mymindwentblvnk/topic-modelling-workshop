In a time when American metal seems to be going down in a blaze of hellfire, a new light has begun to shine in the form of No Remission. Four guys from Westchester ready to unleash their hellish fury on NY and beyond. Band creators Will Checchi (guitar and vocals) and Greg Perlman (drums) began there musical career about 10 years ago in the local band Black Circle. Now, more mature and disgusted by the world, these two have enlisted bassist David Matos and guitarist Kurt Balogh to make No Remission a new voice to be heard. The global conquest has begun. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/No+Remission">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
