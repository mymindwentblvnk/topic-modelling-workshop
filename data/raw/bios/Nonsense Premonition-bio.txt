Nonsense Premonition is born in 2004 with the intention of reaching a very own style and identity basing fundamentally on sounds coming from 'Brutal Death', 'Melodic Death' and american death metal between other genres. Solid, intense and chaotic songs complemented by extreme lyrics though without losing its introspective touch defines the actual sound of the band, that is waiting to realease their new works due to the end of 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nonsense+Premonition">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
