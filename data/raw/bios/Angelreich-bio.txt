The band was formed in 2002 in Pila although since the end of 2005 it has been operating in Szczecin, near the Polish-German border. From the very beginning the members of Angelreich have aimed at creating what is most often described as eclectic and uncompromising metal core with a touch of melody and mosh breakdowns, supported by the crucial message. Both, lyrics and attitude make Angelreich the unique act in the Polish metal core scene. Labeled as antifascists, concerning animal and human rights, the five build their message on environmental care issues and critical look upon mass culture. The band played nearly 150 live shows, touring Poland, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Ukraine alongside Integrity, Evergreen Terrace, Sworn Enemy, Born From Pain, Fear My Thoughts, Maroon and Cataract to name a few. The current discography consists of four elements: "When The Lights Fade Away... Fears Crawl Out" (demo CD, d.i.y. 2003), "Our Minds, Our Thoughts" (split CD with Torment of Prometheus, Fuck.This.Recordings, 2005), "To Know We Can Die Is To Be Dead Already" (split CD with Deathlike Existence, Noones Innocent Records, 2007) and the latest full-length album "The Plague" released on Spook Records in March 2009.
