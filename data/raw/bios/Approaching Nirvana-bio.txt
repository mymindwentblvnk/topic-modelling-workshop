This is Approaching Nirvana.

Approaching Nirvana is a state of satisfaction with any and every emotion, situation, and lifestyle. Their goal, through music, is to explore and express the range of emotions and become content with each of them.

There isn't one musical genre to contain the idea of Approaching Nirvana. Their music is a culmination of genres, styles and life experiences that speak for themselves.

Sam lives in California, and Andrew lives in Maryland. Although on opposite sides of the country, and never meeting, they have managed to compose and produce exciting and unique music. Having only worked together since February 2009, a lot is yet to come.

In our experience, life presents many challenges. One of the biggest challenges is accepting yourself and reaching a state of satisfaction. Discontent with their current life situations, they set out to change their circumstances and reach that state of satisfaction. As time goes on, the music will evolve and change as they change and evolve.
