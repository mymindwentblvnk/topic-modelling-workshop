They Speak in Swarms or TSIS formed from the ashes of different bands which had collapsed through one reason or another. Those ashes were bound together through a love of playing music for the sake of it, and TSIS was bounding forward with monstrous aggression and captivation of a car wreck in progess. TSIS play mostly Metal/ Hardcore music based around the Liverpool/ Warrington Area
