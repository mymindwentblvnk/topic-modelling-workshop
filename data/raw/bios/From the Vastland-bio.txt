"From the Vastland" started out as a one man project fronted by "Sina". In late 2010, "From the Vastland" rose from the ashes of the Iraninan black metal band "Sorg Innkallelse" (a band with 10 album releases in 6 years). The first album of "From The Vastland" released in 2011, it was named "DARKNESS Vs. LIGHT,THE PERPETUAL BATTLE". The album was influenced by Persian history and mythology and this image remains with the band to this day - ancient, epic stories of good and evil, myths and legends combined with atmospheric, blast-beating, Old school black metal with a slight touch of oriental influences. In 2013 "From the Vastland" signed with the Norwegian label "Indie Recordings" and released the second full length album "KAMARIKAN" in March, followed by a live performance at the Inferno Festival in Oslo the same year. Front man Sina was joined on stage by well known musicians such as Vegar "Vyl" Larsen ( Keep of Kalessin/Gorgoroth - live ), Andr√© "Tjalve" Kvebek ( 1349/Pantheon I/Den Saakaldte ) and Thor Anders "Destruchtor" Myhren ( Morbid Angel/Myrkskog ). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/From+the+Vastland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
