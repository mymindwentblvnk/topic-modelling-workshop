This may be an incorrect tag for the rock band Pixies. Please fix your tags if you intended on scrobbled music by that artist.

A girl group called "The Pixies Three" briefly existed in the 1960's. Despite this tag automatically redirecting to "Pixies", this would be the correct tag if you are scrobbling music by that group.

Two other Pixies bands also existed: one recorded a single titled "Santa's Too Fat for the Hula Hoop / Kitty Cats on Parade" in 1958, while another recorded an album titled "The Chipmunk Song" in 1970. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Pixies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
