Spark Master Tape is your favorite rapper, you haven't heard yet. When we first came across Spark, we were deep in a Datpiff hole that lead us to Syrup Splash, a mixtape with a small white child in place of Dr. Dre on the cover of The Chronic. There was a song about Amber Rose's pussy, that was really about the power of all pussy. There was a gut wrenching track about dead homies called "Uzi On My Instagram". We were intrigued. 

#SWOUP Serengeti is one of the best mixtapes/albums released this year. Now you get to hear it. Produced entirely by Paper Platoon, the record somehow manages to have enough bump and 808s to satisfy y'all that think Juicy J is god and enough verbal dexterity to have everyone that misses the old days of rappity rapping. You can bump this in your jeep (I assume you have a jeep), or you can burn one and pontificate life to it. There's enough hard beats, weirdness, and complex rhymes to keep #SWOUP Serengeti in heavy rotation for a long time to come. 

To all of you, pondering the identity of Spark Masterâ€”we can offer you no information. All we've got for you are some great conspiracy theories we've read on messageboards [Madlib, the ghost of Lil Ugly Mane, Professor X, "...a white nigga"] and the best mixtape of the year. #SWOUP <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spark+Master+Tape">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
