Back in late 2004 the idea of a band that could develop a theatrical attitude and combine different musical elements with the dynamics of metal and rock sound, brought DAKRYA to life… 

The first album entitled “Monumento” was released on May 23rd 2008 by the French indie label Another Sphere Records and the Greek indie label 279 Productions. DAKRYA received very good reviews and earned the title of “Theatrical Atmospheric Metal” band.

It was about time to move on… A new concept came up, the influences were different now and the band began to work on new material. The main goal was to develop even more this “theatrical” style. On January 2010 DAKRYA enters the studios in order to record their second full-length album entitled “Crime Scene”. On March 2010 the Charlatans packed their bags and travelled all the way to Sweden and Underground Studios to mix their album with Pelle Saether (Diablo Swing Orchestra, Draconian, Madder Mortem). The mastering was handled by Göran Finnberg (Opeth, Dark Tranquillity, In Flames, Arch Enemy) at Mastering Room AB in Gothenburg. 

Many musicians joined the band through the years but only a few managed to share the band’s vision with a strong will and become part of it. A New Era has arrived! Great Expectations will haunt us till the end of the road…

We have made new plans but our future is unknown… We are going to be disguised in order to uncover our deeper thoughts! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dakrya">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
