Funky Four Plus One (sometimes written Funky 4 + 1) was an early hip hop group.

Formed in 1979, the group was one of the first hip hop acts to have a female MC, Sha Rock. Their most significant hit was the nine-minute "That's the Joint", and they never recorded an LP. They were the first hip hop act to appear on a national television show, Saturday Night Live, in a 1981 episode hosted by Deborah Harry (some have mistakenly reported that Run-DMC was the show's first rap appearance).

The original members were Keith Keith (Keith Caesar), Sha Rock (Sharon Green), KK Rockwell (Kevin Smith), Rahiem (Guy Todd Williams) and Jazzy Jeff see note 1 (Jeffrey Myree). Later Raheim left the group to join Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five and was replaced by Lil' Rodney Cee (Rodney Stone).
