Skanners was founded in 1982. Four years later they released their first album “Dirty Armada”, distributed by CGD MMI. Their biggest success so far was achieved after releasing the second LP “Pictures Of War” in 1988 when they supported mentionable acts such as Motörhead, Helloween, Saxon, Manowar, Dio and Twisted Sister. Due to that they initiated a series of gigs in Italy in 1994. One year later they launched the third LP “The Magic Square”.
In 1996 the band accomplished an additional career boost when they appeared as special guest for Deep Purple during their Italy tour. Followed by their 15th band anniversary and the release of  their fourth album. The following years they retreated until the release of their fifth album which was exlusively launched in Italy.
In 2006 they had a major comeback. With collaboration of  the label My Graveyard Productions they unleashed two historical albums: “Dirty Amanda” and “Pictures Of War”. Two years later Skannersreleased “The Serial Healer” which was available in stores  Europe-wide.

Currently, the band is busy writing songs for their upcoming album which is supposed to be internationally  available in January 2011 via SAOL / H´Art / Zebralution. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skanners">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
