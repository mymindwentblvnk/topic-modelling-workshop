There are three bands named Headfirst - 

1. from Orange County - 

In 1987, the alternative scene was dead, punk rock was becoming passe, hardcore was charging full steam ahead, heavy metal was the norm and speed metal was just starting to make an impact. It was during this volatile musical time in Orange County, California that Headfirst was conceived. Were they straight edge hardcore or self edge?

After minor band member changes within the first year or so, Headfirst settled on the four who would released the Back In Control - EP EP and The Enemy LP.  John Scott (Downer), Michael Rosas (Smile, Satisfaction), Aaron Sonnenberg (Smile), and Kevin Murphy (Farside) toured the country in support of their releases until 1991 when the band played their last show at Spanky's Cafe in Riverside, Ca.

2. from Boston - 

In 1988 Headfirst appeared on the first CD compilation in the New England area (ABCD A Boston Compact Disc), their song "Annie" got significant airplay.  Singer Billy Bracken went on to work at the fabled WBCN and is still in the music industry to this day.

3. from the Netherlands - 

Headfirst is the perfect combination of hard rocking tunes and pop vocals. Since the band’s formation in 2016 they have been rocking stages all over the Netherlands, with great appreciation of the people that attended. The young musicians met in highschool, and shared the same passion for music and eagerness for creating songs that they loved. Because of this Headfirst was formed. Through sheer determination and passion these four musicians have put together a great album that is being finalized and will be released in 2020. The first single of this album is “Dino Disco” and was released on the 20th of march 2020. The second single is ''Amnesia'' and was released on August 30 2020. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Headfirst">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
