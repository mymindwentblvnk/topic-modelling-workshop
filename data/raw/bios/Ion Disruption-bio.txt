Ion Disruption is a brutal/technical death metal band from Belarus. The band formed in 1997 under the name Warkraft, but changed the name to Ion Disruption to avoid any confusion or relationship with the popular video game franchise. 

In 2004 the band recorded its first demo, "Project 3000". The band began recording its debut album "Troops of Eternal War" in 2007 and was released in February 2009 by Soulfesh Collector Records. 

Ion Disruption is currently working on material for a second album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ion+Disruption">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
