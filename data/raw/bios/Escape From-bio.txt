ESCAPE FROM was formed in December 2005 by Marcin ‘Chunk’ Zgoda (guitars), Tomek ‘Ghoc’ Gocek (vocals), Radek ‘Wolish’ Wolicki (bass) and Sławek ‘Saint’ Piotrowicz (drums). After some months of rehearsing Saint left the band and Dariusz ‘Seeg’ Barabaś joined as a new drummer. In September 2007 ESCAPE FROM entered IX Studio to record their first promo CD entitled “Ciemna Strona Duszy”. It featured two songs and was released in December 2007. This material was mainly meant for promotion and to interest labels. In April 2009 ESCAPE FROM yet having no record deal, entered IX Studio once again to record their new EP entitled “Opętani okrucieństwem”. The EP was finished in August 2009. It contains four tracks of blackened death-metal. In the same time Michał ‘Urgul’ Barski joined the band as a second guitarist.
