Infinity Overture was founded in Denmark 2005 by Niels Vejlyt. He set out to write compositions of great intensity, and romantic in nature. To make sure the music is easy to venture into, Niels did a huge job, making the verses and choruses really memorable. But he did not want to loose the feinschmeckers of metal, and shred guitar lovers, so he also included subtle breaks, harmonies and insane guitar solos.
