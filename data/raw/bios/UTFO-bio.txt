UTFO (which stands for Untouchable Force Organization) was a rap group from the 80's founded by R&B band, 'Full Force'. They consisted of 'Kangol Kid,' 'Educated Rapper' (also known as ("E.M.D."), 'Doctor Ice' and 'Mix Master Ice.' Their best known single is "Roxanne, Roxanne", a widely-acclaimed and acknowledged hip hop classic, which created a sensation on the hip-hop scene soon after it was released and inspired numerous "answer" records, most notably by Marley Marl's protege Roxanne Shant√©. Ironically, "Roxanne, Roxanne" was the B-Side filler for the lesser known single "Hangin' Out." Due to personal issues the 'Educated Rapper' ("E.M.D.") was absent for their sophomore effort, "Skeezer Pleezer," which produced one notable track in "Split Personality."

"E.M.D." made a welcome return for the group's successful 3rd release, "Lethal," which featured rock group 'Anthrax' in the title track. Notable songs (from this album) included "The Ride," a several-minute analogy between male anatomy and cars; "Diss," a collection of elaborate rhyming insults, and "Burnin Bed," a hilarious cautionary tale of what can happen to a brother who cheats.

Other hits released by the group include "Leader Of The Pack," "Bite It," "Pick Up The Pace," and the R&B tinged cult classic "Fairytale Lover." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/UTFO">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
