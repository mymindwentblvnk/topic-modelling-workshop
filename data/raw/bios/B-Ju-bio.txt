German hip-hop is an oxymoron. Fortunately, Germans listening to hip-hop is not, and Germans mixing hip-hop is a darn fine thing indeed. Especially when aforementioned Germans engage in frenetic turntablism to do so, becoming party-starting whizz-kids on the wheels of steel.

And whatâ€™s even better is when those Germans take that love of hip-hop and infuse it with the most gut-rumbling subs around to form a bastard bumping house offspring, all swagger and step, and in doing so find favor with that West Coast tastemaker Mr Claude VonStroke. B-Ju is that German, a true child of hip-hops golden generation with a tendency to go off on bass-bump-house tangents, perhaps the only one of his kind and all the more precious for it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/B-Ju">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
