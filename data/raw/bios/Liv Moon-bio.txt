LIV MOON was formed in Tokyo, Japan in 2009 with the single "The Phantom of The Opera" as a female fronted, Symphonic metal band by the vocalist of the band, a Swedish born singer Akane Liv (born as Akane Okamoto-Kaminski). LOUD PARK 09 was the band's first stage-performance and they released an album, Double Moon, later the same year (December 16th).

Akane started her journey as a performer from a Takarazuka music school where she participated in various stages. She took a short leave from the group to travel to England in order to learn singing. In the Beckenham Festival, she managed to win the Singer of the Year award and attracted a lot of attention worldwide. After returning from England, she graduated from the Takarazuka music school and met producer Tatsuya Nishiwaki and later the band LIV MOON was formed.

On June 23th, 2010, they released 'Covers ~Scream As A Woman~', which contained various covers on worldwide, famous songs but with their own, Symphonic metal-touch which its limited edition contained a bonus-DVD, and followed by two releases in 2011; 'Golden Moon' on March 16th and a live-DVD 'Liv Moon Club Show Golden Moon 〜月華月虹〜' on June 29th.
In 2012 they released two full-length albums: The first one entitled 'Symphonic Moon' got released on January 18th and its limited edition also contained a bonus-DVD. And the second one entitled 'The End of the Beginning' and got released on September 25th which its limited edition also contained a bonus-DVD. The album 'The End of the Beginning' also features the following guest members: Kee Marcello (ex-EUROPE), Kiko Loureiro (ANGRA) and Magnus Rosen (ex-HAMMERFALL).
