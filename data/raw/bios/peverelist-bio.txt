Peverelist, AKA Tom Ford, is notable for holding down the Rooted records dubstep specialist shop in Bristol and curating the Punch Drunk record label. Techno at heart but dubstep in name, his music bridges the gap between the hypnotic minimal patterns of techno and the heavyweight polyrhythmic machinations of dubstep. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Peverelist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
