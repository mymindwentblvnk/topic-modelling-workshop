Influenced heavily by the likes of Pantera and Killswitch Engage, Laid In Stone boasts A precision combination of  heavy riffs, pounding bass, and hugely melodic choruses. After a string of tours throughout 2013 to promote their first full length album " Echoes Left Behind", this Detoit touring machine has no plans to stop anytime soon. 2014 saw the departure of vocalist Chad Rice and bass player Jimmy Curtis, however Laid In Stone didn't miss a beat. Core members Trent Heichel, Danny Cummings and Kyle Cummings continued to right new material and brought in long time fan and friend David Keoppen to be the new vocalist. Kyle switched back to his and original position as bass player and the four piece produced the most agressive yet melodic metal songs in the bands history. They released the first single "End Of Our Days" in June of 2014.
