Capharnaum is a Technical Death Metal band founded in the early/mid 90's. Originally from Connecticut, they are now based in Sanford, Fl. After being founded by brothers Jason (guitar) and Jordan Suecof (drums), they began to write songs in the same vein as Death and Cynic.

They have released two albums to date, 'Reality only Fantasized' (1997) and 'Fractured' (2004). The material on 'Fractured' is a bit more technical, and features some jazz aspects as well. It features Matt K. Heafy of Trivium on vocals for 6 of the 8 tracks (Jason sang on the other tracks).

The band is currently on hiatus while Jason produces/mixes albums at his studio, Audiohammer Studios. (Trivium, DevilDriver, All That Remains, The Black Dahlia Murder, Sanctity and many more) and Jordan focuses on producing hip-hop acts (see Crotchduster).

The current line-up is: Alex Vieira (5 Billion Dead, Cannae), Mike Poggione (Monstrosity, Eulogy), Matt Heafy (Trivium), and Jason and Jordan Suecof. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Capharnaum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
