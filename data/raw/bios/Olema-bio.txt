Jyväskylä, Finland (2011 – present)

Olema is a musical project by Tatu Hanhikoski creating avant-gardish progressive/alternative (death)metal. 

"There's always a reason for the "avant-garde" here. In general, it's there for provocation. To provoke the issues that the songs are about. It can also be there becouse of the story behind the album. But there's always a reason. If there comes a disco part after death metal, it's definitely not there becouse of some kind of a humour aspects. Actually, usually those parts that differs from the "normal" are the ones that are the most serious, at least what comes to the lyrics. It's just that how you express those feelings and thoughts. You could, of course, just scream all out and create something that someone has done before. But for me, that has never been enough."
