Japanese band from Tokyo, formed in '97. King Goblin started as a death/grind influenced band like Carcass or Brutal Truth, but from the first demo on they played a weird combination of doom/stoner/sludge/psychedelic metal/rock, 70's prog and free-jazz with partly growling vocals. Their first full-length studio album, named "Goblin King", was released in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/King+Goblin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
