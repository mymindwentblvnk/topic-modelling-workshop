Cassandra Steen (born February 9, 1980 in Ostfildern-Ruit, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg) is an Afro-German singer, also known as lead singer of the band Glashaus.
Cassandra Steen was born in Ostfildern-Ruit near Stuttgart, Germany in 1980. At the age of 17 the singer gained first prominence when she was featured on the 1997 album "Quadratur des Kreises" by Freundeskreis, with whom she toured through Germany, Austria and Switzerland for a few years.

In 1998 Steen was signed by Booya Records, but due to musical differences she soon asked for a release. Two years later a demo tape got into the hands of 3p label head Moses Pelham. The rapper initially engaged Cassandra as a background singer for Sabrina Setlur and Xavier Naidoo, before they started working on Steen's solo debut in late 2000. However, the record became a more commen project, and in agreement with composer Martin Haas they decided to release the same-titled album as a trio under the synonyme Glashaus, Steen singing the lead vocals.

Among three successful albums and number of hit singles the trio also partially produced Cassandra's solo album, "Seele Und Herz", which was eventually released in summer 2003 and spawned the slow jam "Wenn Du Lachst". Furthermore she continued singing background and chorus for label mates Illmatic and Setlur.

Since 2003 Cassandra Steen has made guest appearances on several new releases by J Luv, W4C, Melbeatz, Bushido and Curse. Her latest collaboration with rapper Azad, "Eines Tages" (released in May 2006), has been a big airplay success. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cassandra+Steen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
