Scorner is a Brazilian death metal band, founded by A. Mauricio Laube (guitar) and Silvio Knop (bass). Since its formation, in 1993, the group recorded one demo, Majesty in 1995, and a split CD titled In Inferioribus Terrae in 2000, with the black metal band Insane Devotion.

Scorner had experienced numerous line-up changes, when in the year of 2002 the bandmates decided to finish the band. However, A. Mauricio Laube had reformed the band a couple of years later and started working as one man band project, composing, recording and mastering by himself new songs, which resulted on new album "Bloodshedding", released in 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scorner">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
