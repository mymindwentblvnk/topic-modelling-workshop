In a time where seemingly every DJ and his dog has a record label, it's a real achievement just to stay afloat with so many imprints fighting over a limited stake in the market. However after five years Spearhead Records  has rightfully earned an impeccable reputation amongst drum & bass aficionados for releasing consistently great music; from sweet soulful liquid and sparse minimal to full on dance floor workouts.

Label boss BCee (aka Steve Jeffery) has quietly gone about building a label with a back catalogue graced by some of the scenes biggest names: from Marky, Logistics, S.P.Y., Lenzman, Redeyes and of course BCee himself. Back in 2007 Ram Records' production wizard Lomax found fame within the scene after his ultra cool Brain Freeze EP catapulted him into the limelight and everyone from Blame to Crissy Criss has stepped up to remix tunes from the Spearhead stable.
