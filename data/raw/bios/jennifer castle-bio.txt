Jennifer Castle is a Canadian singer-songwriter, based in Toronto, Ontario. She released two albums under the name Castlemusic.

Born in Toronto, Castle was raised in Mississauga and Orangeville, and spent time living in London, England, and Vancouver, British Columbia, before returning to Toronto and launching her music career at open mic nights in the city.

Castle says that she “takes the world very seriously, while believing very much in impossible things.” This idea of being rooted in the real world – yet still free to soar in the ether of daydreams –  offers insight into the contradictory and alluring world of Jennifer Castle. 

After lending her unmistakable voice to a diverse list of recordings – including The Constantines’  Kensington Heights, Fucked Up’s Year of the Pig and David Comes to Life, as well as albums by Ryan Driver, Eric Chenaux, Doug Paisley and Wooly Leaves – Jennifer Castle now brings her timeless take on folk music to the world under her own name for the first time with Castlemusic. One of Canada’s best kept secrets, Castle has managed to stay low-key and grounded in Toronto, Ontario, quietly crafting songs that capture the wonder of those impossible visions.
