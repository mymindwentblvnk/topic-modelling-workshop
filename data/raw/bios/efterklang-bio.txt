Efterklang is a band from Copenhagen, Denmark consisting of four core members (Mads Brauer, Casper Clausen, Thomas Husmer & Rasmus Stolberg) who have played together since 2001. They are often joined by musicians like Peter Broderick, Frederik Teige, Heather Broderick and Niklas Antonson when they perform live and they also have a 5th member (Rune Mølgaard). They have also regularly performed with Martyn Heyne (piano, guitar, choir), Tatu Rönkkö (drums) and Katinka Fogh Vindelev (piano, vocal).

They released through the leaf label Springer EP (2003), Rumraket (2005), Tripper (2004), Under Giant Trees EP (2007), Parades (2007) and the live recording with The Danish National Chamber Orchestra, Performing Parades (2009) before releasing their 2012 4th album ‘Piramida‘.
 
Along the new album Efterklang also launched ‘The Piramida Concerts’ which premiered in a concert with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in Sydney Opera House May 26th 2012. In Total the band played 16 of these orchestral concerts in connection with the release of the ‘Piramida‘ album.

Efterklang also dabbles with filmmaking (see ‘The Ghost of Piramida’ by Andreas Koefoed & An Island, their collaborative film with Vincent Moon) and they also use to run the tiny, but prolific label Rumraket.

The project went into hiatus in 2014 after the formation of Liima by Tatu Rönkkö, Mads Brauer, Casper Clausen and Rasmus Stolberg.
