REVERENCE LOST is a 5-piece Metalcore Band from Göttingen, Germany. 

They originally startet out as BLEEDING IN DESPERATION in summer 2007, but after playing a couple of shows in their hometown, they wanted to to take their music to a new, more serious, level which is highly influenced by Bands such as MISERY SIGNALS, UNEARTH, AT THE GATES and DEAD TO FALL. 

So far They have released 2 records: "The Dark Delight"  (10-song-demo) and "Face Against Face" (EP). The latter recorded by Maté Balogh, who's been handling recording ever since.
Back then the band focused on finding their own style and was very wide spread in terms of song writing.
Since there were a lot of members leaving and entering the band and lots of changes in the music itself the band decided to rename and to start over with a new album.

They are currently recording their debut "Misanthropy" which will be out in 2011.
