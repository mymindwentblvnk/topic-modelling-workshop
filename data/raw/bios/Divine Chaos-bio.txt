Divine Chaos is the name of at least two bands, one which is still around.

1)  Divine Chaos are a five piece metal band from the south east England, intent on creating better music and a more intense live show than the sort of act people have become used to in recent years.

Divine Chaos blend what they believe to be the best elements of metal into thier own and do not seek acceptance...

2) Divine Chaos is also a rock band out of Regina, Canada.  It consists of Amara Samchinsky, Adrienne Mahoney, Gillian Mahoney and brodie seaman.
