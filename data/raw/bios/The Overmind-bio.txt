At first glance, "The Overmind" will surely evoke a sense of nostalgia amongst gaming fans familiar with the Starcraft series. The Overmind also happens to be the name of South Africa's newest rising star in the world of Death Metal. 

Spawned in the early stages of 2014 by Guitarist Jethro May and Vocalist Wojtek Starzak who were both formerly of Stellawood Decapition, The Overmind is a South African Death Metal act with one purpose: to deliver a sound that is both brutal and musically intricate, with enough melody and drive to appeal to even the most critical of Extreme Metal fans. 

Shortly after its inception, Deven Phillips (Ex Divine Affliction) was added as second guitarist, Brynn Huxtable (Ex Pledge Defiance) was added on Drums and Grant Scrooby (Ex Divine Affliction) was added on bass, thus completing the lineup. The name for the band was adapted from popular science-fiction game lore, which in turn led to the lyrical concept behind the band and their debut release, Dissolution. 

The quintet rapidly gained popularity and recognition following their 2015 release of Dissolution, not only in their local scene but around the world as well. Towards the end of 2015 they joined forces with bands from South Africa and the rest of the world to unleash a Halloween themed album entitled "Astral Evisceration On All Hallows Eve". They then went on to collaborate with Decimated Humans on an album entitled "Mutilations And Dissolutions" which contained all previously released tracks from Dissolution. 2016 saw the band part ways with long time drummer Brynn Huxtable. The Overmind is currently in studio recording their long awaited debut full-length album out mid-2016. Stefan Bartels joined the band in 2016 to take up drum duties. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Overmind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
