The band LOST LIFE TROUBLE was founded in 2005. The musical goal is to create a mixture of uncompromising and relentless brutality with the technical edge of extreme Metal. Influenced by bands such as The Black Dahlia Murder, Despised Icon, Hatebreed, Misery Index and Cannibal Corpse, this young musicians try to combine the elements of those styles of music. The own style, which is coined of catchy melodies, brutal riffs and fast, technical passages, is what the band tries to improve over and over.After nearly six months the band played their first show and more shows followed until the end of 2005 with local bands, which led the band to a growing fanbase in their area. With their energetic live-performance the band achieved a good reputation , both in the music scene and the local press. In the end of march 2006 they entered the DocmaKlang Studio (Neaera, Black Destiny) to record the first Demo.The Demo does not only compromise a really great production because of Matthias Lohm√∂llers impressive work, but also a new sound, which deliveres the perfect blend of extreme music without sounding like a copy or something already known. In May 2006 the band was signed to the young label Darkest Days Recordings. With the help of the label the band tries to spread the word for their music over the local borders and evolve as a band and as musicians.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lost+Life+Trouble">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
