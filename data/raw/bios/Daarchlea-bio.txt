Daarchlea is a Metal band originated from the city of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Young, brutally intense, unrelenting and outright savage are just a few ways the local metal community will describe the new offering of Daarchlea and their music. Full with dark and horror atmosphere in their songs, they are still trying to improvise their knowledge and gain more inspirations towards metal music, growing bigger day by days, in order to create the another side of dark metal music. Blending the element of Black Metal and Death Metal, they are deeply influenced by bands such as Behemoth, Cradle Of Filth, Dimmu Borgir, Krisiun, Deicide etc. While most bands struggle to evolve and stay vital within the extreme music genre, Daarchlea manages to do so effortlessly.
