Caleborate is the musical project of Caleb Parker, an artist from South Sacramento, California . Still in his teenage years after starting out at the age of just 15, his youth sees him create boisterous verses that combine witty wordplay with strong hip-hop beats, echoing his "desire to bring people together through common lifestyles and experiences." He released his first album LHLT in October 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Caleborate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
