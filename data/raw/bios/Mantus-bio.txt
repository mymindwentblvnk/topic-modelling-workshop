1) Is a project by Martin Schindler founded on or about 1997 which disbanded in 2005 but reunited in 2008. Both Martin Schindler and Tina Schindler are also active in electro act Black Heaven and metal outfit Sepia.

The band's name derives from Roman and Etruscan mythology, where Mantus and his wife, Mania were gods of the underworld. They were associated with the city Mantua. Mantus was identified as the "leader of souls", escorting the souls of the dead down into the underworld.

As already said, Mantus is a project by Martin Schindler. But his idea of dark romance only could have been realised by alternating singing of female and male voices. That's why he involved his sister always named as Thalia, which is certainly not her real name.

So the alternating female/male-singing is one incisive aspect of Mantus' musical appearance. Overall the style of the music ranges doom-metal to some kind of pop.  The texts contain themes like love, hate, death, perpetuity or immortality but also criticism on global problems as racism, xenophobia and rape.

The reason for their minor popularity in spite of existing for 8 years and releasing 6 albums is that they never gave concerts or appeared in the charts (they never had any ambitions, too).
