DEVILISH ERA was born from FJALAR's ashes as that band had been existing since 1997. 
At the beginning, there were two members in that brutal black-metal project :

Lord Naggaroth
(guitars/vokillz)

Viscount Krantar
(guitars/bass/drums machine)

FJALAR changed its name into DEVILISH ERA in 1998. 
The first real demo was released at the beginning of 1999 and was entitled Winds Of Hatred. 
It is divided in two parts.
The first one consists of four new tracks that were recorded in January 1999. 
The second part deals with three bonus tracks extracted from the FJALAR's era (recorded in 1998). 
The whole demo sounds like traditional black-metal (ENTHRONED, DARK FUNERAL…). 
Metalfreaks enjoyed that demo despite a poor sound quality. 
In the middle of 2000, Viscount Krantar decided to leave the band. 
His dedication to black-metal was no longer so strong as it used to be …

Then Naggaroth was alone to lead the project and he began to work on new tracks for the second demo - Eschatology. It was ready in the summer 2001, but with hindsight, the result was not satisfying at all. 
So Eschatology tracks were put on a split demo tape where you can find Naggaroth's former bands - DEVILISH ERA, FJALAR (RIP) and PAGAN GRIEF (RIP).

In September 2002, six new tracks - with rather good sound - were recorded for the split cd-r entitled Prolegomena To The Theory Of Wrath. 
The other band featuring on it is Naggaroth's new project - ZAGHURIM (with Azazel from NECROFURYA). 
DEVILISH ERA new tracks are more elaborate as brutality faded to atmospheres. 
ZAGHURIM tracks sound quite experimental with black, electro and ambient elements.
This cd-r is the first production of FOEDUS AETERNUS association (fanzine, distribution, gigs …).
