What was to become Synarchy was formed in 2004 by John E. Láadal on guitar, Ísak Petersen on bass and Martin Rói Villhelmsen on drums. The band grew into a sixtet with Andre Lenvig on 2nd guitar, Leon B. Hanson on vocals and Bjartur F. Clementsen on keyboards. After a short time, John Ivar Venned replaced Andre. The band played a couple of shows before recording their first demo, wich will never see the light of day again. Martin Rói then left the band, and Kim Joensen was asked to join.


Synarchy then underwent a process of change which took some time. After writing new and improved music they finally recorded a demo in Winter 2006/07.
After a while John E. Láadal quit, and Pól Jespersen was asked to join as guitarist and back-up vocalist and made the band a full six-piece again.


In 2009, Synarchy went into the studio to record, and on April 15th, they released their debut album entitled 'Scars Of Gratitude'
