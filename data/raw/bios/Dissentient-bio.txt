Biography
“Suddenly - without warning or preparation - came a destruction so swift and so malign that the aftermath would forever embed itself into the fabric of history. No adequate amount of preparation could have saved us from the annihilating Black Hole Machine. DISSENTIENT's indestructible creation was designed to obliterate any living organism. This is not an album. This is not just another progressive death metal masterpiece. No! DISSENTIENT's Black Hole Machine is an entity that always was and forever will be. It is the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. 
This is the last album you will ever hear and the only one you will ever need! 
This is Ottawa's proudest moment.
Incubating in the dark recesses of Phill Campbell's psyche, DISSENTIENT has been growing into its existence since 2005. After periods of change and upheaval, Campbell's vision for a project that would incorporate elements of black, death and progressive metal has become what it is now: an unstoppable force. 
Fused with some of the catchiest and chunkiest riffs around, matched with robotic precision drumming, vocal tones that are as deep as Hell's Abyss and an energy that rattles your very core, DISSENTIENT's full-length release is truly amazing. 

Recorded locally at Pebble Studios with the engineering wizardry of Mike Bond (www.producedbybond.com), Black Hole Machine is one of the best produced albums of 2011. Every instrument is heard and nothing is out of place. The guitar solos on this album are spectacularly executed with magnificent tone and definition. 
Vocally, this album is ab-so-fucking-lutely incredible. Phill Campbell's guttural attack is killer and there are a few tracks that have successfully incorporated clean and melodic vocals. Now before you go off on your own little tangent, give it a try. This is clean vocals done right. 
As I said, there is nothing that is out of place on this album. Everything is meant to be exactly where it is.”
