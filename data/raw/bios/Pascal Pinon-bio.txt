Pascal Pinon are twins Jófríður and Ásthildur Ákadóttir from Reykjavík, Iceland. When they were fourteen they got together with two of their friends and decided to start a band. Using the instruments they had, the group played various local venues and started recording their first album. The self-titled effort was well-received, but by the end of the touring period the band comprised of just Jófríður and Ásthildur, and it remained this way from then on. Their sophomore album, Twosomeness, was released in 2013 to critical acclaim. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pascal+Pinon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
