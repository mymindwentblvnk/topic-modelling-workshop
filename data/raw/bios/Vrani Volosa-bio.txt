Vrani Volosa (in old Bulgarian “black hair”) is a pagan black metal band from Bourgas, Bulgaria.
It was founded by Hristo as a one-man band back in 2003. The early ideas of the project were influenced by the music of bands like Primordial, Enslaved, Borknagar, Burzum, spiced with the ambience of Pink Floyd and the psychedelia of the 70’s.

The band has four releases:

2004 - Vedi (EP)
2005 - Where The Heart Burns
2010 - Heresy/Epec
2013 - Sailor Songs (DVD)

The new album Heresy/Epec (Ерес means "heresy" in Bulgarian and is pronounced "eres") marks a change in the musical direction of the band, as the songs are more epic and even post-rock oriented, with catchy melodies and folklore passages. All the vocal parts are "clean" and sung by Hristo. Vocal duties on the first two releases were done by Atanas Ivanov.

Current line-up:
Hristo Krasimirov — Vocals, Guitars (2003-present) 
Kolyo Zhelyazkov — Guitars, Tambura (2006-present) 
Dessislav (Desso) Ivanov  — Drums (2006-present)
