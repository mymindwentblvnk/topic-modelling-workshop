Fleshold was formed back in the early 90's when the death metal scene was at it's peak, they released their first album titled Pathetic in 1995. When their record label, Massacre Records, went under the band continued on and through several lineup changes the current members have developed their own unique, original style of heavy music unlike many other bands. Since former drummer Joe Nunez departed and joined Soulfly, Fleshold has continued on writing and recording their strongest material, yet, with 3 consecutive demos receiving great response from many fans, critics and bands throughout the US. Fleshold has been compared to bands such as Rage and Helmet.
