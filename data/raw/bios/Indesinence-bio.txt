Active since 2002 and equally inspired by doom staples such as Cathedral, Trouble and Sabbath, the sound of the elder British and European death metal bands, the cosmic death of Thergothon and dISEMBOWELMENT and a generous serving of outer influences from across the leftfield spectrum, London’s Indesinence have been pursuing the path of expansive and monolithic doom death across one demo, one EP and two full-lengths. The latest of these, entitled "Vessels of Light and Decay", was released in October 2012 through Profound Lore records; its seven tracks further refining the balance between dissonance and eerie musicality, and hazarding a vertiginous leap towards the consolidation of Indesinence’s own distinctive voice.
