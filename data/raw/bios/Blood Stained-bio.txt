There are a few bands named Blood Stained!
This is the description of the Austrian Heavy Metal Band from Linz:

Blood Stained were formed in 2003 by Jack Power and Mountainking. After a short quest the other band members joined the band. Several live appearances (e.g. @ Posthof Linz, Planet Music Vienna) have established Blood Stained as one of Austria's hottest bands on stage. The Demo- Album "Into Battle II" was released in 2004 and has been sold over 250 times. The brandnew full-length demo "Exit To Nowhere" contains 55 minutes of self-produced material. Unfortunatly our bassist floss decided to leave the band after the upcoming shows in september. His successor is going to be one of BLOOD STAINED'S closest friends. "Our goal for the future is to defend the position as one austria's leading heavy metal acts" as vocalist PHIL VAN DER KILL explains.
