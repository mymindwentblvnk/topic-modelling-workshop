Weak Aside are a german Death Metal band from Emden, Lower Saxony. The band startet 2006 under the name Spearhead and switched 2007 to their current name Weak Aside while recording their debut Fire at Will in summer 2007, wich they released early 2008. After several line-up changes they began recording the second album Ghostleader wich was released 2010 under the label Remission Records. Approximately half a year later most of the musicians left the band. For one year they performed live with friends as stand-in musicians until they found Marc Dieken as their new drummer, bassist Alex Pahl and Luke Kerk as the new guitarist. The new album The Next Offensive was released 2015 under FDA Rekotz.
Their Style can be described as mid-tempo Death Metal with oldschool vibes reminiscent of Bolt Thrower paired with Fearer, the former band of Weak Aside's singer Thomas Zorn. 
The lyrics deal with warfare and it's horrors,  not to glorify war but to martially criticize it without political statements, like in the spirits of grindcore tradition. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Weak+Aside">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
