Satanarchist fuse technical thrash and blackened crust with anarcho-punk to create their own formula for DIY metal. Their debut EP, Making Threats at Punks Again, manages to be as complex and engaging as it is stripped-down, visceral and raw. Breakneck drumming, well crafted riffs and blood soaked vocals detonate from the opening battle cry and continue to the final chord with so much ruthless intensity you could forget the band has only two players. Loaded with wry political underpinning and bids for demonic vengeance, the EP makes it clear that the band takes little seriously beyond their drive to create some of the most cunning heavy music weâ€™ve heard in a while. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Satanarchist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
