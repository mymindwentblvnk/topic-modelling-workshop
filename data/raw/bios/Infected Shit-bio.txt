Infected Shit was founded in late 1999 in Tilburg, Holland, as a three piece: Paul and Bart on guitars and Dennis on bass and halfway in 2000 followed by Patrick on drums.
Their goal to produce sick, downtuned Deathmetal!
In the rehearsal room the beginning was made for a couple of songs together with some covers (Terrorizer, Death, SOD, Autopsy, Obituary) when Tony from Belgium took up the mic. for Infected Shit.
Tony was only able to stay several month's with Infected Shit but the foundations for the Infected songs were build.
After Tony's departure Infected Shit continued songwriting while searching for somebody who could give Infected Shit some low gutteral vokills. After a little while William ''The Butcher'' was welcomed and Infected Shit is now working on finishing the own material.
After a couple of months William chose to leave Infected Shit, after receiving another offer. Just before Williams' departure John joined the Shit on guitars in addition to Bart. Shortly after this Patrick quit the band because of health problems and was replaced by Maurits, followed by Teun as replacement of the vokills. The Infected Shit material is cumming along fast with this new line-up, sounding faster and more brutal than ever.
