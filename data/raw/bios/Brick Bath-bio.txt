Brick Bath is a Los Angeles based metal band formed in 1996.  Their assault has been labeled metalcore by the popular trend, however their music displays many of the same traits as the acclaimed Pantera and other heavy metal/post-thrash bands.  Riff-heavy, and groove-oriented, Brick Bath's songs are straighforward yet they display a range of muscianship not found in most metalcore. Brick Bath's lineup consists of lead vocalist Cody Hubbard, guitarist Eric Meyer (Ex-Dark Angel), bassist Pete Stone (Ex-DFA , Ex-Teabag) and drummer Scott Babbel.  They have released 3 albums as of 2006, all of which are on the small Crash Music label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brick+Bath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
