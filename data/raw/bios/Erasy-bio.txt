Erasy is a stoner metal band from Feira de Santana, Bahia. 
'' The idea came out when we were drinking a couple of years ago, talking about the biggest band on earth: Black Sabbath. We are long time friends, and we have other musical projects, individually, but never did something on this line. We thought, hell, we can do it! And then the whole thing started. Since 2012 we are playing slow music. ''
