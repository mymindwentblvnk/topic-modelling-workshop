Swedish citizen, Christian Smith spent the late 80’s years in Germany soaking up the early house and techno sound of Sven Vath. Now based in Sao Paulo and Barcelona, he has been championing his funky mix of house and soulful techno for more than a decade, playing across Asia, North & South America, and Europe, plus regular slots at festivals like UK’s Creamfields, Holland’s Dancevalley, Japan's Wire, and Brazils's Skol Beats. His music released on a variety of top labels like Renaissance; Adam Beyer's Drumcode, Josh Wink’s Ovum, Carl Cox’s Intec, John Digweed's Bedrock, and his very own Tronic, only proves his flexibility in the studio. Similarly on the decks, Christian’s set is a cauldron of chunky grooves with loads of energy and playing on 3 decks. Some of his favorite clubs are: Womb, Tokyo; Loft, Barcelona; Pacha, Buenos Aires; Arches, Glasgow; and Zouk, Singapore. With a full length Smith & Selway artist album out on Sino in late 2007 and massive crossover support from DJ's ranging from John Digweed to Carl Cox to Richie Hawtin, the future is very certain for Christian to stay on top as one of the leaders in forward thinking dance music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Christian+Smith">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
