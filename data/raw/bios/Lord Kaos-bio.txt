Lord Kaos was an Australian black metal band that formed in Sydney in 1994. 
For several years the group was the most prominent act of its style in the country with one founding member going on to record and perform with several Norwegian black metal bands including Dimmu Borgir. While Lord Kaos only released one album, the group was a considerable influence on the local heavy metal music scene as not only arguably the first but one of the few bands to record and perform Norwegian-style symphonic black metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lord+Kaos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
