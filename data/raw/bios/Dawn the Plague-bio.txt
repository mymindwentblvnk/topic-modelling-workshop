BIO:

Out of the woods, from the depths of hell, THE PLAGUE DOTH RISE!.... In the tradition of one man black metal masters such as Burzum and Graveland, Dawn the Plague spews out it's unholy hymns, all at the whim of sole member Dagon..... Summoning the lost magic once posessed by albums such as Emperor's "In The Nightside Eclipse," the Lo-fi blizzard of Darkthrone, and the solitude and longing that seeps forth from Burzum, Dawn The Plague combines these early and true sounds in a way never heard before. Instantly familiar, but laced with a new disease of sound..... Recorded exclusively in the night-time hours, in the bleak Northeast U.S., Dawn the Plague is the new definition of TRUE!!! Taking all of these old spells and weaving them into a brand new black magic!.... All Hail!.... Spread the Plague!!!!.... ..
