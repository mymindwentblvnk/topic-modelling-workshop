I remember seeing jameson Raid many times at "The Greyhound" in Chadwell Heath, Essex on a Thurdsay night. Don't remember too much about them but they must have been good as I kept going back :) 

the only song I can remember is "It's a crime" - accompanied by sirens and blue flashing lights.

**************************

Jameson Raid (1976 to 1982) were a fantastic live band playing really original Hard Rock music. They were later associated with the NWOBHM movement and produced one of the very best tracks from this era 'Seven Days Of Splendour'. 
Vocals: Terry Dark.
Guitars: Ian Smith.
Bass: John Ace.
Drums: Phil Kimberley.
They released two EPs: 'Seven Days Of Splendour' and 'End Of Part One' and a demo cassette usually refered to as the 'Electric Sun' demo with Steve Makin on guitar, later in Slade 2.

They have a website:

www.jamesonraid.com.

They are considering releasing some archive material and possibly even reforming for a reunion.

The song 'One City' is NOT by Jameson Raid - don't know why it is here. A folk / emo type group from Leeds has called themselves 'The Jameson Raid' (possibly not a smart move, since the original rock band isn't quite dead yet - and has published records...) Maybe it is them? <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jameson+Raid">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
