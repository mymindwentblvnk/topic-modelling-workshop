Ridden is the breakthrough music project developed by Michael Chavales, a Greek sound engineer born in Athens in 1983. Michael's deep interest in music technology and specifically in the digital sound processing area was the major factor that sprouted his enthusiasm and got him started producing psychedelic trance music in 2005 after his first visit in a big outdoor festival. For the next three years he experimented with various styles and techniques and in 2008 he joined Harmonia Records and the Ridden project was finally born. Since then, and after the release of his debut EP “Loosing Control” , Ridden smashes the dance floors with its unique style. Heavy kick drums, warm baselines and crunchy melodies are his distinct production characteristics that will guide you through unforgettable music journeys. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ridden">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
