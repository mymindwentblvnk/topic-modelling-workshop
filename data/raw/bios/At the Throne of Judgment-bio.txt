At The Throne of Judgment was an American Melodic Death Metal/Metalcore band from Lebanon, Ohio.

Formed in 2006, the band recorded a 5 song demo with producer/engineer Joey Sturgis (The Devil Wears Prada, Into the Catacombs, Every Bridge Burned, Before Their Eyes) of The Foundation Studios in Connersville, Indiana. After the demo was recorded and released, they were signed by Oregon record label Rise Records in October 2006. Since being signed, they have released one album, entitled The Arcanum Order, which was released July 24, 2007. The CD featured three rerecorded versions of demo songs, and was also recorded and produced by Rise sponsored Sturgis. The band has been touring nonstop across the United States since releasing the album. They have been featured on numerous Rise Records tours, and we're recently on tour with The Number Twelve Looks Like You.

The band has undergone some lineup changes, losing their original vocalist Eric Kemp to pursue a degree at Kettering School of Advertising and Arts. They have since picked up Matt Smith (former vocalist of Brother Von Doom) to fill the slot and are still touring to promote their album.

On December 12, 2007 the band posted a blog announcing their breakup due to financial issues. Eric Kemp performed on their last two farewell shows. In mid October, 2008, a follow-up blog entry was posted announcing At The Throne Of Judgment will continue to exist as a part-time band, also announcing the work on an upcoming album.
