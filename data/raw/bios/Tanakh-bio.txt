Tanakh is the name for music written and improvised by a collective of musicians; music that is focused towards beauty and experimentation within structure instead of towards a particular musical genre or style. In the last six or so years this revolving collective has included a large number of musicians headed up by principle songwriter Jesse Poe. Although currently residing in Florence, Italy, Poe comes from a background of American rural music. His great-grandfather wrote country ballads and his great aunts and uncle had a live radio program broadcast out of Indiana. Besides his work as Tanakh, Poe has produced/engineered for Jim White, Pelt, The Iditarod, Iris, and others, singing back up as well as playing a variety of instruments. He has also sung back up for the Anomoanon, sung back up and played electric guitar for Six Organs of Admittance, played percussion for Mick Turners Bonnevill project, played guitar and various instruments in Tiger Saw and various ethnic instruments for Koester as well as performing in other projects. Poe has also studied Karnac vocals and sitar for three years under Nirmal Bajekal, who appears on Tanakh's Villa Claustrophobia release. Poe has done film music for short independent films including Greater than 1/2. He has worked as a producer and an engineer both in the US and overseas and has published short stories, poems, and creative non-fiction in various magazines and journals. He is currently writing for Dream magazine (CA) and Terrascope Online, and is living in Florence, Italy,  playing with concerts with his band Tanakh and doing solo performances. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tanakh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
