The Berlin and London based duo (Francisco and Alicia) have been cooking up songs for their debut EP since the project begun in the spring of 2020 as Corona first started to take a grip on the world. They only managed to perform three concerts so far due to the Corona pandemic, the first a live streamed show at Berlin's legendary 8MM Bar and as support to Sofia Portanet as part of the Synaesthesie Festival concert series.

Having recently collaborated on a Christimas single with UK punk rock legend Eddie Argos and Berlin indie favourites Gurr, Minimal Schlager in a short space of time have earned respect from their peers and have had wave of offers for producing, remixing and collaborations.

Influenced by dark/dreamy or even oneiric pop music, Mininal Schlager wouldn't feel out of place in a future David Lynch project. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Minimal+Schlager">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
