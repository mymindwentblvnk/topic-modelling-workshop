METAL is an Australian heavy metal band straight out of the old school of traditional balls to the wall heavy metal. Think back to those heady glory days of Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Motorhead and Manowar, “when men were men and songs were forged with blood, sweat and steel,” says bassist and lead singer, Rayzor Ray. “Proving our Mettle is a bare-chested scream of defiance, and a rallying call to the true,” continues Rayzor. “It is our banner planted firmly in the ground and from here we stand and fight. Fighting for Metal is not just a song: it’s a mission statement.” And it’s a fight they’ve taken to the streets, with the lads having made a name for themselves on the local scene as an act with more hair, denim, guitar solos and high-pitched metallic screams than you can wield a flaming sword at




Ambient, hush-rockers Metal is made up of Aaron "Beardo" Shepherd and Eric "Laserwolf" Lee. Based out of Portland, OR., Metal resides on Artistery Records/ Hangar 18 and has released three albums- World Ocean, The Silent World, and Sounds of Our Seas. "Take the overall electrified folk smolder of Six Organs of Admittance, destroy some of the form and rework into drone, and you're coming close to Metal." - The Williamette Weekly.
