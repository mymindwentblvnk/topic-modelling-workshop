The Week That Was is the first solo project from Field Music co-founder Peter Brewis.  He has released one album under the moniker.

Recorded and released during a hiatus taken by Field Music, fellow members David Brewis (Peter's brother) and Andrew Moore, along with other collaborators of prior Field Music works, still played a role in the making of The Week That Was. Similarly, Peter assisted on David's own solo album of this time (Sea From Shore, under School of Language. 

Peter has described the album as being very conceptual - ideas of imagined thrillers and questions on the cultural dependence on constant information weave their way across the lyrics. The music is written heavily and intricately, somewhat matching the similarly intricate themes. 

The album was ranked 8th Best Album of 2008 by Mojo Magazine. It was recorded and produced in Field Music's own studio in Sunderland. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Week+That+Was">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
