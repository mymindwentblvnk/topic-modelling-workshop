'We are a "Party Death Metal band" from Madrid (Spain) called ThebandaparT (named after Quentin Tarantino's production company: "A band apart", proof of our great appreciation for his works). If we had to describe our sound, we'd say we're too melodic for the Brutal Death and too extreme for the metal-core crowd... We love it this way and if you ever happen to attend one of our shows, you'll totally feel like we are kicking you in the balls.
Anyways, we are 5 nice and positive Spanish dudes doing what we love the most. Not giving a fuck about everyone's bullshit, having fun playing fat music and getting rude on stage; that's what we do. Every show is a party, and we encourage everyone to get on stage, headbang, mosh pit, head-walk, stage dive and, of course, sing along. We have lots of fun at shows, so why shouldn't you? We have recently released an 8 track CD called "Death can Dance" (Oct.2007, Mastered in West West Side studios(NY) by Alan Douches: Cannibal Corpse, Whitechapel, Nile, Converge, The Dillinger Escape Plan, etc...) on Threepoint Records (SP). We haven't stopped touring all over our country eversince, as well as the UK, Belgium, Italy and Portugal. We are currently writing some new shit and will be touring as much as possible for the rest of 2008... so check the dates on the schedule and come break your neck with us.'
