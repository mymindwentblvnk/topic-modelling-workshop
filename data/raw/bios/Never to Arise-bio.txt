Never To Arise is a Death Metal duo based in Florida. Gordon Denhart and Mike Kilborn combine forces to discharge a brutal musical concoction that exemplifies not only the pureness of what “Death Metal” should be but what lies ahead for the future of the genre. “Hacked To Perfection” is at its core a release that is thematically and musically grounded in the ugliness, brutality and finality of death. Let the hacking begin. Released May 15 2012 on badGod music.
