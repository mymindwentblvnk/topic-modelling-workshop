Sacrificial Massacre is an NS Black Metal from Milwaukee, WI.  Originally formed in '08 under the name, Mermeroth, the 'Nocturnal Processions' demo was released in '09, shortly there after Taylor was replaced with current drummer J.G.M.  From here the band morphed into Sacrificial Massacre with the two-man line-up of A.A.Q. (Guitars & Vocals) and J.G.M. (Drums and ambiance).  In '10 & '11 the demos 'Through Fire to His Grim Idol' and 'Fulfill Thy Cravings of Flesh' were released, most recently followed up by the debut full-length, 'Dry Spells & Serpent Gods' on Dread Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sacrificial+Massacre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
