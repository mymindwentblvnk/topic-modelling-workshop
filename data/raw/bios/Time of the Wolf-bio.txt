Time of the Wolf is a Washington DC based Black thrash Metal band.  Though formed earlier, the band played their first show on 6/6/06 at a black metal fest in Baltimore.  The band features ex-Exosus and current Tradition Dies Here members.  They released a demo on 6/6/06, and a full length in the fall of the same year.  Though already well like and respected in the DC area, Time of the Wolf seldom plays live.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Time+Of+The+Wolf">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
