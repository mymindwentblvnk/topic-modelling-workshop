For many years songwriting team Kirk Layne, on drums/vocals, and Al Gollehon, on bass/backup vocals, cranked out rock & metal in various projects while working with many musicians. 

Developing a unique yet seductive style over the years, they invited guitarist Myke Starr to audition and then join to make what was a high energy trio, playing clubs and parties in the Houston scene, but mainly developing recording techniques. 

Drummer and friend Robert Cordray was eventually offered a chance to take over the percussion section when Kirk decided to move up to the front of the stage with the vocals. 

The bands real passion was working behind the scenes in the studio, writing and composing new songs.  The result was a CD released in the late '90s, "All Is Well".  

The somewhat Goodnews/Gospel flavor of the music of Iyam will inspire listeners of all genres and ages.

In 2009 Kirk Layne began the process of digitally remixing all of the All Is Well tunes and started releasing them by introducing "Majestic Union (2009 Remix)" in February, 2009.  Other songs will be released as they become available.
