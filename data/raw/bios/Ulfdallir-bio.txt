History of Ulfdallir began on the eve of Yule in 2014 (December, 20), when Auðunn - vocalist and bass player, and one of the founders of MDM-band Envenom (RUS), decided to gather like-minded people and create viking- / melodic death metal band. It was due to the fact that most staff of Envenom (RUS) did not see their creation in this (Scandinavian) category. However, it didn't stop Auðunn, and together with Asleifr and Hafrgrim, they created a new band. 
In December of 2015 it was decided to invite for recording an old friend of Asleifr and Auðunn - Ragonar. It was caused by necessity of relieve tension from the musicians (originally, guitar parties was to play Asleifr). In early January of 2016, after the year's break, due to different circumstances and difficulties, the band started to record their debut album. Despite the impressive delay, work on the material didn't stop. Coming up new riffs, lyrics and even the composition as a whole, refined and reworked already existing material. 
May 18, 2016 to Ulfdallir joined drummer Sigurðr, instead the digital Sven. We started joint rehearsals. 
July 15, 2016 released the long-awaited album "Fenrir's Wrath". 
The name of band chosen not accidentally. The Elder Edda says that in the Wolf's Valley lived three brothers. It echoes with symbolic number of founding members. Later the founders became twinned.
At the last of 2016, Asleifr left a band and 4 other members began to prepare for concert activity. After 6 months of searching for a guitarist instead of him, co-founder and lead guitarist of legendary Russian funeral doom metal band Comatose Vigil - Alexander Orlov (Asbjörn) joined the group. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ulfdallir">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
