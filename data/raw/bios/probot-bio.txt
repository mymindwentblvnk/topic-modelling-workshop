The all-star metal project of Dave Grohl where he played almost all the instruments (outside of lead parts by Bubba Dupree of Void, Kim Thayil of Soundgarden, and bass parts by Lemmy) that featured a multitude of vocalists. Dave recorded tracks reminiscent of the singers' respective bands, which he grew up greatly admiring, and sent the recordings to them, with a note stating simply "Send back with vocals."
