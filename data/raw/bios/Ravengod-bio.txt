Ravengod was a short-lived Norwegian Black Metal band from Bergen, which was founded in 1994 and probably closed around 1996 around.

The band played for the subsoil typical Raw Black Metal the old school. The only demo (alleged name: "Battle Metal") contains four untitled pieces, and was never officially released. Somehow, however, managed a copy of the demo into the Internet.

The band consisted of frontman Taake "HÃ¸st" (play (s) in Gigantomachy, Deathcult, Ofryskje, Ragnarok, Slavia and Vendigeit), the Helheim and Aeternus-bassist "V'gandr" (play (s) and Cult Of Catharsis, Deathcon, Taake and chaos predicted) and a drummer with the synonym "per thousand".
