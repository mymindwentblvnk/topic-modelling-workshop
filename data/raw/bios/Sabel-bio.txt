There are two artists named Sable.

Influenced by an eclectic combination of genres and artists, Sabel's repertoire is a mixture of deep, heartfelt ballads, uplifting, sweet, feel-good songs, and powerful alternative rock jams - each one a personal journey, voiced in rich and varied textures. She will be releasing her debut EP this year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sabel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
