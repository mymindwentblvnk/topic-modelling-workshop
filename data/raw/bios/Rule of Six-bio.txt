Rule of Six was the musical outlet for the Berlin based collaborative work of Nadine Raihani and Robert KÃ¼hr. The collaboration began in 2001 - 2002 when the two met through mutual friends and grew and shrank in members over several years, always maintaining collaborative core of the project.


Nadine and Robert are now at the core of the Berlin based band Lux.
