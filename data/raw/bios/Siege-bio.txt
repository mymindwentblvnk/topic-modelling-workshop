There are 4 bands called Siege:

1) Siege was an American hardcore punk/fastcore band from Weymouth, Massachusetts. They were active in the 1980s Boston hardcore scene from 1983 to 1985, and reunited briefly in the early 1990s.

Siege's unprecedented level of extreme hardcore punk was some of the fastest and heaviest of its time, incorporating lightning fast tempos, chord changes, vocal delivery, and blast beats into its style, thus setting the stage for the emerging grindcore scene. And though rather short-lived and little-known during their existence, subsequent musicians have cited the group as a profound influence, including the famous British band Napalm Death and the American band Dropdead, whose name was derived from the title of Siege's demo of the same name.

2) Siege was a self-proclaimed "True Hampshire Heavy Metal" band from Alton near Winchester who released one 7", 'Goddess Of Fire', in 1984, and also recorded a session for Tommy Vance's Friday Rock Show in 1986. 

3) DJ from UK.

4) Raw American Oi band with a Celtic influence.
