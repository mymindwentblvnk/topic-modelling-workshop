Abe Vigoda was an experimental, tropicali punk rock band based in Los Angeles, California but originally formed in Chino, California in 2004. They took their name from the actor Abe Vigoda most famous for appearing as Detective Sgt. Phil Fish on the sitcom television series Barney Miller from 1975-1977. They gained noteriety for their performances at The Smell.  They have so far released three full length albums, the first of which, Skeleton, was released in the U.S on July 8th 2008 on Post Present Medium. 

Abe Vigoda are the new LA punk secret weapon. Coming from a shattered and splattered background of no wave, pop, darkness and hope, Abe Vigoda brought forth a sound that is tempting and beautiful, yet melodic and tropical. 

The first proper full length comes in the name Skeleton and is a twisted joy ride through the four boys private party. Soothing parts that remind you of Captain Beefheart and My Bloody Valentine, or some punk with a haunting reggaeton pulse that makes you move. When the record is done after a little more than thirty minutes, you are left feeling that there is something they are trying to tell you, on second listen it smacks you in the face... Abe Vigoda are here! Coming from the same team as The Smell champions No Age and Mika Miko, Abe Vigoda held a DIY attitude and lay all over the place whenever they can, bringing an instant vibe all their own.

They have since broken up. Michael now has a side project under his own name, (he released an album off of Big Joy Records). Juan Velazquez (guitar/synth) has started a new band known as Roses. David plays in a rad pop band called Dunes who are out on PPM.
