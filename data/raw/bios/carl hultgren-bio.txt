The name Carl Hultgren might not immediately ring a bell, but there’s more than a chance that you’re familiar with the guitarist’s first name, which is more often than not paired with wife and bandmate Windy Weber to form the long-running guitar-and-bass drone duo Windy & Carl. Hultgren recently issued Tomorrow (his debut album) after 20 years of establishing and maintaining his signature drifting guitar sound with Windy on albums issued by some of the biggest imprints of the 90s/00s space/post-rock movement, including Kranky, Ba Da Bing!, Darla, Music Fellowship, Rocket Girl, Enraptured, Brainwashed, the Great Pop Supplement, and more. Many of these releases came to define the deepest aural reaches of the scene, spawning many followers that continue to crop up today. Hultgren took a few moments following the release of Tomorrow to discuss the surprisingly comfortable nature of recording his solo debut, Windy & Carl’s two decade-long legacy, and a few of his main musical influences. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carl+Hultgren">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
