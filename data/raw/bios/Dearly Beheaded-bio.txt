Crushingly groove metal from the North of England. 
Dearly Beheaded combined the thrash of Vio-lence and Slayer with the modern rage of Machine Head and Fear Factory, but with the heavy groove of bands like Corrosion of Conformity and classic Black Sabbath.
The first Album, Temptation had a classic metal feel to it, a kind of Slayer meets Sabbath, whereas the follow up, Chamber of One, nodded more to Machine Head, Fear Factory and Pantera.

Their singer, Alex Creamer, later formed I-Remain.
Their drummer Simon Dawson later formed Devilment and joine Steve Harris's British Lion. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dearly+Beheaded">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
