4. Hailing from the Central European state of Slovenia, Rotor formed in 1998 when six of the country’s leading DJs and producers in the electronic / club scene came together to develop an outlet for their music on the live stage. Off the back of debut album Rotosphere (1999; NIKA (Slovenia), EFA (Germany)) Iztok Turk, Janez Hace, Mario Marolt (aka Electrosaurus), Marjan Crnkovic (aka DJ Dojaja), Damjan Bizilj (aka DJ Bizzy) and Sergej Randjelovic (aka Runjoe) have toured together playing festivals in Slovenia and neighbouring Central European states, including an appearance with US soul/house diva Barbara Tucker, as well as making Slovenian television appearances and performing twice at the Miss Slovenia event. As their live shows have sharpened so too has Rotor sound been honed and defined, and album Phonophobia demonstrates the refined peculiarity and playful eccentricity of the music they have conceived together.

Fresh, distinctive, unusual, idiosyncratic; all words that could aptly be used to describe the sound of Rotor, but what stands them out most is their fun and playfully creative approach to fusing electronic music with live jazz, funk and lounge. On their latest album Phonophobia the Slovenian collaboration of imaginative musicians have inventively crafted together an exceptional record that moves effortlessly from laidback dub funk to eccentric jazz disco. It’s an album that’s hard to define, but nonetheless easy to enjoy.
