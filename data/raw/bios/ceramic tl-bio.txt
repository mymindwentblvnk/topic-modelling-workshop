Ceramic TL is a project of material sound and concrete emotion - tranquil, concussive electronics from Toronto-based musician David Psutka.

Euphoric and dismal...inwardness as hypercolor swirls in fuel spills; econoline psychedelia...synthetic celebrations of the industry of human spirit.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ceramic+TL">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
