Smokers Die Younger are an eclectic six-piece band from Sheffield, England. Their music ranges from grunge rock to abstract avant-garde noodling via dub reggae and synth pop, but still manages to manifest a coherent and original sound. This sound has a lo-fi feel to it and features strong use of harmonious and disharmonious vocal parts.

In September 2009 Smokers Die Younger released their second, self-titled album via iTunes.
