Broderick Gray (Rick) is not a novice in the U.S. Underground scene. While picking up the guitar as a child, he studied hard to develop an advanced guitar technique and is now considered one of the virtuosos of the Neo-Classical genre in the U.S. scene. While co-operating with many bands including Timejam, Mass of Virtue, Amethyst, Allegiance, Nyxx, Metal in Action and Final Prophecy, among others. Gray was also constantly working on new musical ideas for his solo project entitled “Mythic Force”. Under that name he released several albums including “Realms of Fire”, “Sacred Vision” and “Mythic Force I, II and III”. “Metal Machine” is once again a collection of Gray’s ideas which ended up as instrumentals. Even from a flashy listening, it’s obvious that he is deeply focused on executing powerful Neo-Classical Metal instrumentals with catchy melodies and often extraordinarily fast and extremely skilful playing. Another fact which I quite enjoyed is that Gray flirts with Phrygian scales and there’s a strong “ala turca” feeling in many of his songs. One bright example is “Dawn of the Dragon”, a significantly wonderful track that makes known to people that there’s much hidden quality out there, and also notifies that Virtuoso Guitarists are not an endangered species any more. “Horizons of Glory” is another grand opus with a Phrygian-based riff and a very baroque atmosphere, which reveals also Gray’s ability to compose lengthy tracks without even one dull second. It’s hard to pick a favorite song from “Metal Machine” since it’s an album destined for Neo-Classical Metal fans and people who enjoy music with vision, passion and highly skilled performances. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Broderick+Gray">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
