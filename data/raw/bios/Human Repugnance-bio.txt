Human Repugnance is brutal death metal / slam death metal band located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and Baltimore, Maryland (United States).

Originally formed in September 2008 they released a three song demo in March 2009 which featured their first three songs written; "Decaying Cranial Mass", "Feasting on Flesh", and "Torture Crypt". The demo was self released through the internet and heavily distributed which caught the attention of Despise the Sun Records (ITA) who signed the band for the release of their debut full length.
