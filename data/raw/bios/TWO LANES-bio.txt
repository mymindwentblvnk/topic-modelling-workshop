Electronica duo TWO LANES blends acoustic piano recordings with analogue synthesizers and minimal beat elements to create their signature sound. Made up of Berlin-based brothers Leo and Rafael, the duo has found a loyal audience in their native Germany and beyond. On their latest release - the Reflections EP - they continue to expand upon various genres, ranging from neoclassical, ambient and melodic techno.

Raised in a musical family, the two brothers took different musical paths growing up. Leo showed an early interest in playing the piano, immersing himself in the works of JS Bach, Schumann and Debussy. Eventually, he would go on to study at The Juilliard School in New York City, where he earned a Master’s Degree in Historical Performance. 
Rafael on the other hand was always fascinated by the possibilities of electronic music. He spent endless hours experimenting with sound design and electronic production. At some point the brothers realized that their talents complemented each other perfectly, and TWO LANES was then created.

It didn’t take long for their sound to catch on, as they quickly attracted radio support from the likes of BBC1, Sirius XM, Triple J and amassed over 50 million plays across all streaming platforms. With their evocative and expansive sound, TWO LANES is positioned to be a fixture in electronic music for years to come. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TWO+LANES">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
