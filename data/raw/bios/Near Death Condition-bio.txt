Near Death Condition was born in Switzerland and is evolving in the death-metal underground scene since 2001. The band has recorded and released its first demo entitled "Delusional Perception of Reality" in 2005.This first effort features 8 down-tuned brutal death-metal songs focusing on mental disorders with 2 dissonant keyboards interludes. Highly rated reviews have been compared to the older Morbid Angel style and Angelcorpse, showing the undeniable potential of the band.

The band then started to play live to show everybody their vision of death-metal, sharing the stage with internationally acclaimed bands such as Origin, Hour Of Penance, Lay Down Rotten, Darkane, Slit and Prejudice.

Working on new songs since 2007, the band aimed to create a more brutal style, yet with more atmospheric and darker vibes. In 2009, the band recorded 11 songs for their second effort entitled "The Disembodied â€“ In Spiritual Spheres" in their own studio and entrusted the famous Herzt Studio (Vader, Decapitated, Behemoth, Kronos) in Poland with the mixing and mastering. Lyrically inspired by religious literature and nihilist philosophers, this album features one of the most extended ranges of vocals in the current death-metal scene, and a mixing of modernity with its brutality and killer production mixed with old-school elements with its dark vibes and atmospheres.

Near Death Condition is now proud to announce that its new album will be released by Unique Leader Records, the only label devoted to real brutal music. They have signed a three album deal and are planning to start touring next spring/summer.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Near+Death+Condition">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
