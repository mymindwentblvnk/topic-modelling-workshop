Darkest place was one of the best bands from Maputo, Mozambique, 
from the high and agressive voices to the fast playing guitar 
and hard beating drums. In late October of 2006 a group of 
young teenagers decided to form up a band. In the beggining 
It really had no name. But for some reason people started 
calling them Darkest Place. Although the name was not official 
by the time. It started off with only Roger, Papito, Zezinho & 
Gerson.
