Markus Guentner represents the ambient-leaning end of the Kompakt label spectrum, proof positive that the label offers far more than tech-house along with Olaf Dettinger, Ulf Lohmann, and Argentina's Gustavo Lamas; his productions for the Cologne, Germany, imprint are rarely reliant upon beats and overt melodies, often sticking to drifting, oceanic atmospherics and chime-like effects. In 2000, he released his first single on Kompakt with Regensburg and produced the 12" No Title for Mathias Schaffhauser's Ware label. Prior to making his full-length debut the following year with In Moll, two of Guentner's tracks (including "Regensburg" itself) were featured on Kompakt's Pop Ambient 2001 compilation. ~ Andy Kellman, All Music Guide <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Markus+Guentner">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
