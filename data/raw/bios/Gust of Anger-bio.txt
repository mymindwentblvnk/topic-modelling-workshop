Gust of Anger was formed in RÄ«ga, Latvia in 1997 from a reunion of remains of various Latvian heavy metal bands such as Huskvarn, Moral Free and Mortmain.

Initially the band was called Ultra, and recorded a demo, which mainly enjoyed distribution throughout Russian Federation and the Baltics. On advise of the record producer the band soon after also decided to change names, and adopted the more appropriate moniker Gust of Anger.

The band started to perform successfully around the Baltic States and earned a great reputation relatively quickly. Their new style and energetic musicians helped earn them respect on the indie circuit. After the initial success of Civil Peace, the band decided to incorporate a new agenda, which would be able to compete with the popular bands from West. Concerts were scheduled around the Baltics, new tracks introduced and regular venues and new sets were created. Since then, public performances with the bands Overkill, Annihilator and Cannibal Corpse have kept them in the forefront of the Latvian music scene and seen the bands popularity continue to soar.

As the singer and bass player wanted to move in another style direction, in November 2004, Gust of Anger split up. After changes between members the band is still active under name Trendkill Method. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gust+of+Anger">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
