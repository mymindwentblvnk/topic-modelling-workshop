Lokai's debut album continues a brilliant run of form for the Mego- allied Mosz label. This Austrian duo, comprising Florian Kmet and Stefan NÃ©meth, centre their spare, measured explorations on the many sounds of the electric guitar: leaving openended arpeggios hanging in elegantly distressed space and garlands of feedback intertwined with fiendishly processed electronic noise. The juxtaposition of unhinged sonics with professional attention to detail is invigorating throughout - check out the molten, wayward electricity smeared wantonly across the stark, monochrome spaces of "Taora Atoll", or the interplay between the swelling skeins of guitar and the measured sub- bass modulations on "Hellen". The album's centrepiece is the sprawling, multidimensional "Chuuk", a rolling, gathering cloud of amorphous sound, which thickens gradually from almost nothing to a piercing climax before subsiding like slo-mo skyscraper demolition into fraught, tense silence. Not easy listening but enthralling all the same. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lokai">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
