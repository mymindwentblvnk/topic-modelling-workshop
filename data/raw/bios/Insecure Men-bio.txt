Saul Adamczewski and Ben Romans-Hopcraft are Insecure Men. After Adamczewski was temporarily kicked out of the Fat White Family to rehab from drug addiction, he teamed up with his schoolfriend Romans-Hopcraft (Childhood). They released their eponymous debut album in 2018. 

Considering Adamczewski is one of the main songwriters in the Fat Whites, and that the brothers Lias and Nathan Saudi from the same band helped out with the songwriting for the album, it comes as no surprise that the lyrics of Insecure Men cover the same seedy topics of paedophilia and premature death, in particular in the entertainment industry. The music however leans more towards accessible Indie pop, with influences ranging from 1970s glam rock to space age exotica. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Insecure+Men">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
