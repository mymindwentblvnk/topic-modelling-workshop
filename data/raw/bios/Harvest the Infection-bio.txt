Bio:
Harvest The Infection from Vancouver B.C Canada was formed in 2009 for the sole purpose of writing, recording, and performing progressive death metal. With their blend of tech, mixed with progressive melodies and monstrous grooves. The band has a tireless work ethic for rehearsing that borders on a soft addiction. Harvest the Infection spends countless hours in their rehearsal space refining their craft and perfecting their songs.
Just finishing off their first E.P. "Biopsy", Harvest the Infection is now looking to book gigs across North America. This group of five serious musicians all share the same passion and vision to put the best music forward they can. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Harvest+the+Infection">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
