Xamavar was founded by Jenia 'J. Grand' and Shaemus in October 2005 with a decisive aim: 
To fuse together a vast array of influences, cultures and styles into an ever-surprising blend of harmony and contradiction. 
And in doing so, to captivate an equally wide range of audiences, offering them a refreshing mix of familiar and brand new.

The cast fully reflects this diversity: Savannah (vocals) is a vivacious opera-trained jazz singer from Australia, Shaemus (bagpipes) was instructed 
by some of the best pipers in Scotland, Jenia Fab (violin) received a meticulous musical education in St. Petersburg, Xachi (drums) performed all over 
Europe with a renowned Israeli orchestra and Ramy (bass) is a self-taught musician and a devoted flower-child.

Xamavar's music is conceived by Jenia 'J. Grand', who possesses an incredible flare for originality in composition and a strong affinity with the adventurous and unexpected. 
The lyrics are jointly crafted by Shaemus and Savannah, both gifted poets and daring artisans of the English language.
