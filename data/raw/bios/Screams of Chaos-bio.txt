There was also the 1993 Australian industrial metal band called Screams of Chaos which was known for its bizarre style that combined several extreme metal influences with industrial. The band achieved significant notice for its only album Genetic War (1997, re released in 2003) since band leader Neil Johnson is a professional film maker and shot many music videos for the songs. Few of the videos caused some controversy in Germany for featuring video material from concentration camps of World War II. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Screams+of+Chaos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
