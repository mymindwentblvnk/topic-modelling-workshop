McFadden & Whitehead were an American songwriting, production, and recording duo of R&B, Disco, and Funk music. They wrote and produced some of the most popular R&B hits of the 1970s such as "Backstabbers" for the O' Jays among others. McFadden & Whitehead were primarily associated with Gamble and Huff's Philadelphia International soul music record label. They formed together as a group officially under the name "McFadden & Whitehead" in 1977. The pinnacle of their success came in 1979 with "Ain't No Stoppin Us Now," which went to #1 on the R&B charts, #13 on the pop charts, sold 8 million records worldwide and was nominated for a Grammy award. After this major hit from their debut album, they scored some moderate hits. However, neither sophomore or third albums drew the same level of attention. Their final single recorded was entitled "Show Me The Money." The duo was featured on the Oprah Winfrey Show, where they sang their most famous song on an episode in which Oprah featured the top hits of the 1970s. He also had a partner in crime outside of the group Terry Price. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/McFadden+&+Whitehead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
