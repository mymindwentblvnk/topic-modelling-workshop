Akitsa is a black metal band from Montréal, Quebec. They now consist of  two members. They released the short demo "Totale Servitude" in 1999, which was more of an experiment in various black metal sounds. They pulled it together in 2002 for their first album "Goétie", which was raw black metal with RAC and even punk/oi influence. The lyrical themes are generally about Quebec nationalism and its History, nature and misanthropy among others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Akitsa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
