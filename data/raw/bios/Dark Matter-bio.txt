8) Dark Matter is a five-piece heavy metal group from Kansas City, MO, USA. Dark Matter actually began in 1996 when John H. (vocalist) from St. Louis, MO, began writing songs under that moniker. In 1998 the solo act fleshed out into a full blown group upon the addition of Dave (bass), Kevin (drums), Brad (lead guitar), and John C. (rhythm guitar) from Topeka, KS. Each member contributes equally to the crafting of these incredible songs. With a killer bass, one phat guitar, and another doing intensive colorwork the often maddening syncopation of odd time signatures are wrapped up by off-kilter drumwork. And lyrically, Dark Matter goes over the top. The dynamic vocalist sings about an impending mortality, science fact/fiction, and societal misgivings. They released two albums - The Ultimate Killing Machine (2000) and Structure in the Storm (2003) before disbanding in 2005.

9) Dark Matter is an original instrumental progressive metal band from Limerick, Ireland. Formed in 2010 from the remains of previous bands. The original line up consisted of Eoin Crowley (guitars, synths) Dave Oâ€™Dowd (drums, programming) and Mick Leonard (bass guitar).
