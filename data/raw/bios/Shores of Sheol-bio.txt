Shores of Sheol is a one man black metal band from Austria. Founded in early 2005 by Marko KÃ¶fler, Shores of Sheol's early demos were heavily influenced by early Satyricon, Beherit and Burzum(while not sharing Varg's ideology), but progressed into a more melodic Greek black metal sound later in their career, mainly influenced by Rotting Christ, Agatus, Countess and Varathron. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shores+of+Sheol">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
