Kiley Lotz formed Petal in 2012 in their hometown of Scranton, PA. Petal currently has a rotating line up that includes members of Tigers Jaw, Three Man Cannon, Halfling, Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, and Captain, We're Sinking. In 2013 Petal released their first EP, 'Scout,' which features Ben Walsh and Brianna Collins and was recorded by Matt Schimelfenig. Combining a wide array of influences, Petal falls somewhere between Cat Power and Lemuria while still creating their own distinct sound. Crunchy guitars juxtaposed with clean vocals and earnest lyrics help define Petal as a voice, strong and unwavering, rising out of a chaotic world to assert its place. The repetition of “I was born” in Left A Mark further establishes this idea of presence and purpose, moving away from idle absorption into the masses. With Scout, Petal announced their presence, ready to be heard. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Petal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
