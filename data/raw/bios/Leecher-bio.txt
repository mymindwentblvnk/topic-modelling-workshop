"The band was formed in 2008, and the actual line-up is from 2010 the following: Kornelia Stefan (ex-6test) - vocal, Abel Libisch & Adam Nagy â€“ cellos, Tibor Takacs - keyboards, Dave Tamasi - drums. A little bit symphonic, though it's more metal , but altogether very melodic music, where the hard tunes of cellos are enthroned with an angelic voice. The guys are working on their second EP, which will come out in spring with their first videoclip." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Leecher">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
