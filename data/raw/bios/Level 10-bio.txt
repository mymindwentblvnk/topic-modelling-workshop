LEVEL 10 was born out of a collaboration between American powerhouse singer Russell Allen (SYMPHONY X, ADRENALINE MOB, ALLEN/LANDE) and the acclaimed German producer/bassist Mat Sinner (PRIMAL FEAR, SINNER). The pair met a few times during the years and swore to each other to find the time to work together. That occasion finally came about when Frontiers president Serafino Perugino managed to connect with the two and get them committed to the creation of a new metal album which could meld the more contemporary and aggro sound of ADRENALINE MOB with the more traditional European power metal assault of PRIMAL FEAR
