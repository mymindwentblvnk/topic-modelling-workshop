"We are not trying to re-invent Metal", says Michael. "European Metal often seems to lack dynamics and is not really open-minded for new ideas and grooves.
What we want to do is go the American way of mixing modern sounds and grooves and adapt that to our style of playing Heavy Metal." The result of which is a bastard of driving aggressive Thrash Metal riffs that cut into your brains just to be banged out again by groove and mosh parts breaking your neck muscles.
