Summum Malum was a band of hateful Black Metal from the north of the country, formed in 1996 by Murmurio and L. G. Amduscias. They released a rehearsal tape with two songs in 1997, and later a second tape with seven songs called ‘Evil Rehearsal’. In 1999 they released their first official demo called ‘Lusitanian Evilness’, and the following year a limited edition 10"EP called ‘666’. The band’s name showed up in the newspapers once or twice because Murmurio was thought to be connected to the Ílhavo murders in 1999 (in which the frontman of Death Metal band Agonizing Terror stabbed and killed his parents). But he was acquitted. After a while the band split up.
