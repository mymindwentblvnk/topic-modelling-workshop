After making their way through Metalcore and two releases (“After The Last Breath…” MCD & “Dedicated To The Fears” Split CD with Brazilian’s xConfrontox) the band’s found a mixture somewhere between metal, hardcore and rock. Elements like blasting drum parts and angry vocals combined with sometimes melodic and straight forward rocking guitars, heavy breakdowns or pure mosh are typical trademarks for the band’s sound today. With their first full length album “Decades In A Bleeding World” the five guys pushed themselves into a new chapter because this masterpiece is convincing and imaginative Recorded at Rape Of Harmonies by Alexander Dietz, Patrick W. Engel & Ralf Mueller and mixed & mastered at Antfarm Studios by Tue Madsen. This record is breaking the band’s old boundaries and smashes the audience with its intense aggression, catchy melodies and features like clean vocals, piano or even elements like drum’n’bass samples and synthesizers. Lyrically the band deals with very personal, emotional conflicts and tries to process personal losses that are reflected within the lines full of sorrows, tragedies and dead love but sometimes lights at the end and hopes. Check out the show section and try to catch the band at one of their lively and intense shows. Watch out for their new full length “Decades In A Bleeding World”…
