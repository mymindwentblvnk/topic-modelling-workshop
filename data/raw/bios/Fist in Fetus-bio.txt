Brainchild of two Finnish music makers, Perttu Vänskä and Matias Kupiainen - "when everything created by others starts to sound boring, you're really the only one left to keep yourself interested. So we decided to create something totally for ourselves - we can only hope some one else is bored also". Death metal, grind core, melodic metal, orchestral music, fast guitar and more mixed up and out came Fist in Fetus.

Project started on fall -06, all music written between August -06 and May -07, recorded, mixed and mastered between March and May -07.
Guest solos on Fist in Fetus EP by (in song order) Malla Vivolin (flute), Osmo Vänskä (clarinet), Olli Vänskä (violin), William Suvanne (soprano saxophone), Risto Kupiainen aka Speed Piano Soolo (synth solo) and Iiro Rantala (piano). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fist+in+Fetus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
