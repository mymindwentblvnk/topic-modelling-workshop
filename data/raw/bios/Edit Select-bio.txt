Edit Select is one of several monikers of Glaswegian techno producer Tony Scott, who has been active since the early '90s and previously released material under names such as Percy X and Mion. He established the Edit Select project, as well as its eponymous label, in 2007, focusing on atmospheric yet stripped-down, back-to-basics techno tracks for club use. Several 12"s appeared, including releases on labels like Ostgut Ton and Figure, as well as remixes for the likes of Speedy J, Chris Liebing, and VCMG. Edit Select's debut full-length, Phlox, appeared on the German label Prologue in 2014. During the same year, the artist released an edit of Teste's classic 1992 track "The Wipe." Collaborations with Dino Sabatini and Mike Parker followed, as well as singles on CLR, Dreiklang, and Lanthan Audio. In 2016, Edit Select and Antonio Ruscito released the deep, spacy collaborative LP Visitors - Projections. The following year, Edit Select's The Bridge EP was released by Soma, which had previously been home to the majority of Scott's earlier work under the name Percy X, including three full-lengths and nearly two dozen singles. Shortly following 2018's Horizon EP, the label released the full-length Cyclical Undulations, easily the most expansive, accomplished Edit Select work to date.
