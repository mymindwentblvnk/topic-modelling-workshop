Sunflower Bean is an indie rock/neo-psychedelic trio from New York City. It consists of frontwoman Julia Cumming (formerly of the band Supercute!), Olive Faber and Nick Kivlen. The band self-describes themselves as "neo-psychedelic for the digital age". 

The band formed in August of 2013 and released a single titled "Bread" shortly thereafter. In 2015, they signed to Fat Possum records and subsequently released a debut EP entitled "Show Me Your Seven Secrets" prior to their first full-length record "Human Ceremony" all whilst performing more shows in their native New York City than any other band during the course of 2016. 

In 2017, Sunflower Bean signed to Mom+Pop records and released their sophomore effort "Twentytwo In Blue" the following year, embarking on a tour across Europe and the United States in support of the album in 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sunflower+Bean">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
