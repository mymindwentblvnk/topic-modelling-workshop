Viking Crown is one of Phil Anselmo's (ex- Pantera, Down, Superjoint Ritual) side projects, featuring Killjoy of Necrophagia and Phil's then-wife, Opal Enthroned (Southern Isolation). Viking Crown is pure black metal and the recordings are often quite lo-fi. The group recorded three records ("Unorthodox Steps Of Ritual",  " Innocence From Hell" and "Banished Rhythmic Hate") before it was time to break up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Viking+Crown">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
