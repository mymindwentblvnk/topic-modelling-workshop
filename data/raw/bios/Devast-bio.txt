2006 saw the creation of DEVAST, its two founding members are no other than: Idir (Morbid Desecrator) collaborate with several bands such as SACCARAT (2003); DEADSTONE (2005), THE CULT OF SATANACHIA (2006).

HELLSPAWNBLASTER: former drummer of KULT OF THE SATANACHIA (1999), BARBAROS (2001), RAHDJ (2003), DEADSTONE (2003).

These founding members who already have extensive experience in the Algerian Metal scene.

In summer 2006 A. AZIZ joined Devast, himself having participated in many projects including VOMYGORE ,and became an official member which gave the band stability in its line up.

DEVAST plays a very complex and sophisticated style, than we can define by TECHNICAL BRUTAL DEATH METAL with a progressive touch sought in apocalyptic themes and dark-deep topics.

The first steps of Devast were with participation in LELAHEL FEST 2006 (The biggest Metal event in Algeria) including BLOODYSIGN (FR) and LITHAM (ALG). In the following months Devast has continued to give gigs and recorded its first demo DELUGE OF HATE (beginning 2007) and a split 5 ways with RECTALIZED RECORDS (FR).

It was in summer 2007 that Devast has undergone another change with the departure of HELLSPAWNBLASTER and in the meantime, the arrival of a session drummer.Devast recorded its debut album ART OF EXTERMINATION wich was was produced by DEEPSEND RECORDS ( USA).

Early 2008 REDOUANE AOUAMEUR ; bassist-vocalist of LITHAM and CARNAVAGE (Algerian grindcore band) integrates DEVAST as an official vocalist. The new line up began an professional career on a solid foundation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Devast">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
