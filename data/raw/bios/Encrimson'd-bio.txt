ENCRIMSON'D formed during the summer of 1999 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. Sharing a natural musical and philosophical connection, Shaun Koelsch (guitar), Jared Mason (drums) and Chris Danecek (bass and vocals) forged a four-composition demo of unique black metal. Due to academic pursuits, the brotherhood temporarily parted ways. Koelsch studied classical guitar at St. Thomas University in St. Paul while Mason took up percussion studies at MusicTech of Minneapolis. Meanwhile, ENCRIMSON'D promoted their summer work which received enthusiastic response form various underground metal media sources.

As caustic winter winds set over the land, ENCRIMSON'D took up arms once again to sculpt two monumental tracks for a second demo. In order to explore the essence of voice and rhythm-unbound by prescribed patterns-the majority of the vocals on this demo were improvised, giving this material an experimental quality.

By summer 2000, ENCRIMSON'D had developed a scathing style of black metal with deep influences of rural, medieval and folk themes. Creating their most advanced work to date, this third demo was recorded with unprecedented sound quality. During this time, the band played successful shows in the Minneapolis area and received label interest for their newest material. ENCRIMSON'D entered the studio to record a full-length album. The new self-released debut "Agrarian Menace" has been unleashed, and is ready to plow over the land.

Combining primitive force and elegant melody, ENCRIMSON'D craft a style of black metal all of their own. From rebellion to celebration, from regret to joy, their music invokes an array of emotions. ENCRIMSON'D beckon the peasant within us all. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Encrimson%27d">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
