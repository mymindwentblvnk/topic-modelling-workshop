Mono:Massive is an austrian beatmaker since the late 1990s, making hiphop music with attention to authenticity.
mono's music is a fusion of organic sound textures, synthetic sounds, outside the box groove patterns and warm, analogous style mixing to achieve a forward thinking beat structure but keep that oldschool hiphop spirit. the sampling is based on 50s to 80s jazz, soul, funk and progrock records.
mono worked with international musicians and rap crews, and contributed to a few compilations and albums in europe and the USA. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mono:Massive">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
