"Pound for Pound the HEAVIEST band in North Carolina!"

My Undoing was formed in March 2007 by drummer Chris Phillips and guitarist/vocalist Rob Bullard.The first time they played together they knew that what they had was going to be a lot more than just another side project or local band.  After much seaching and many auditions they sealed this powerful rock solid line up with Daniel "Tank" Wheeler on bass/vocals,and Brian "Beaner" Cocker on lead vocals.  They are a heavy blending of a wide variety of hard hitting styles of new generation and old school metal with a southern flavor.  Their pounding beats and grooves fueled by low ended guitar and bass tones coupled with a good mix of clean melodic,and gritty sceaming vocals make My Undoing a force to be reckoned with. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/My+Undoing">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
