After a tumultuous year in 2009, The Omen return with a new line up, new music and a renewed vigour to play thrash in 2010.  Joining Rory, Joel and Coops are the newly relocated Reece from Stand Defiant on Guitar, and Craigos from Seduction/In Name and Blood on vocals.
Together the group play a unique blend of flat stick thrash influenced from their love of Punk and Hardcore.
The Band have just released a 7inch record consiting 3 songs recorded live to the digital format by the band themselves, in the room where the band rehearse at Melbournes Three Phase studios.

Room Five takes it name from that very room.

While recording demos for the upcoming release, the band was taken aback by the energy captured by the live demos that they decided to cancel the studio time booked, and record the 7 inch EP themselves.

Tracked live over the course of 3 days and nights, what was captured was 5 dudes, crammed into a room and pushing each other to get the best possible outcome.
