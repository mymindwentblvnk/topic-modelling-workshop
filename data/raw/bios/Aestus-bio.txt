Coming from Southern California, Aestus is a metal band devoted to writing and playing quality music. It all started in the Summer of 2009, when Julian and Dakota met at a music camp in Los Angeles. They connected quickly with their mutual love for Lamb of God and Metallica. There, they wrote some of the current Trigger riffs. They jammed a few times between then and the Spring of 2010, but it was not until the Summer of 2010 that things became extremely serious. The band wasn't officially formed until the Fall of 2010. That was also when Robert, who goes to school with Dakota, joined the band. Lots of songs were written, and finally Dan was added to the roster as a second guitar player/vocalist. Aestus has eyes set on making it and will not let anything get in their way.  

Influences range from Lamb of God and Gojira to Pantera, Wintersun and Animals As Leaders <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aestus">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
