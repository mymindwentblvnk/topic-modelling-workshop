There are 2 bands with the same name:

1-Progressive/Power Metal from India

2-NS Death Metal from USA. 
A project of  Wehrmachsadler (Brumalis & Aryan Wind).




1) Blood & Iron... the band was formed by Ashish in early 2005 with Krishna(ex-drummer) and Vivin(keys) but the line-up stabilized only by the end of the year with the inclusion of Mark(vox) and Arun(bass). We've punched up our sound with the inclusion of a 2nd guitarist, Vikram. Praveen is the latest addition to the line up. We're working on a concept album which we hope to finish real quick.. till then get a taste of our music by listening to the stuff put up here. If u can't guess.. we play pure heavy metal with progressive and symphonic touches. People have said the band sounds like everything from Power Metal to Prog, so take ur pick, the band'll just stick to good 'ol metal :-p. Trying to play metal like it's never been played before, to do something new, something beyond the standard metal band. Playing metal in India is never easy, especially in Chennai.. but BnI sticks to their guns. B&I has been through a lot in it's short lifetime. We've been the underdogs but we've always delivered kick ass and pure metal. Also won quite a few competitions and played numerous shows in Chennai (duh!.. obviously), Mumbai, Bangalore and Pondicherry. Metal Rulez!
