Switchblade Scream are a thrash/power band based in Glasgow, Scotland. The band band describe themselves on MySpace as "Epic Black Power Glam Thrash Metal". They take a wide range of influence from all ends of the melodic metal spectrum. The combination of these elements make for a melodic thrash paced, bass heavy sound with plenty of harmonized vocals, melodic lead work and a two way guitar assault.

The line up of this band is as follows:
Matt (vocals and majik)
Al of D (high notes and drop kicks)
Gaz (high notes and thunder from down under)
Stu (bass king)
Steve (drums and piracy).

In their time together since early 2008 they have only had one line up change in which Steve, the current drummer, replaced Simon very early on.
