Requiem Mass is a four-piece Metal band from Albuquerque, New Mexico U.S.A. Built from the ground up as a professional, precise and energetic band, Requiem Mass is one of the Southwest’s finest.

"Sonically futuristic in nature yet thematically grounded by emotion, Requiem Mass combs through the circuits of the human mind. On Redefine Requiem Mass use jackhammer thrash with relations to Entombed and a unique blending of effects resulting in an album that, while thoroughly occupying, is one meticulous attack after another. At times, rogue synapses from the progressive world make their way into the sound as Requiem Mass tears across a vision colored by solid and limitless musical composition based on the broken mechanics of man. Some songs even have a psychedelic approach; as if somehow a Doors and Kreator albums are playing at the same time. The tracks light up with superb solos individually tailored to match the feel set by each song. Groove inducing slap bass and temperate drum work with creative cymbal arrangements set and maintain the rhythm. Mintle’s vocals manage an in-key scream that perfectly display aggression but preserve melody. “Never Could” is a song that especially stands out; the sounds and highlights of the previous tracks amalgamated in metal might with steady verse riffing, a ringing and engaging chorus, and a soulful solo give new momentum to the second half of the album. Redefine is well thought out thrash with some new twists. This album will surely be residing in my stereo for some time." – Luke Offield, Heavycore  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Requiem+Mass">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
