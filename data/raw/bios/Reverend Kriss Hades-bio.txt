Kriss Hades is the extreme metal guitarist and artist best known for his roles with Sadistik Exekution and Nazxul. Originally from Melbourne, he was initially recruited for Sad Ex in 1989 but didn't join the band until 1991, after the release of their debut album The Magus. He was also a member of Nazxul between 1996 and 2003. During this time he recorded a debut solo album that was released in 2002. The album featured several remixes of Sadistik Exekution songs and backing vocals from Mandy Andresen of Lycanthia.

Hadesâ€™ solo work is dark, avant garde, ambient black metal and drone doom that draws parallels to the likes of both Beherit and Sunn 0))). His live shows are combinations of excessive guitar violence featuring combinations of him playing and destroying his guitars to backing tapes and samples and lurid visuals; in early 2005 he supported Sunn 0))).
