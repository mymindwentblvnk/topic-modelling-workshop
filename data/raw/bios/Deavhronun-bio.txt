Deavhronun is a one-man melodic death metal project currently based in Southampton, England. Its music draws on classic melodic death metal bands such as In Flames and At the Gates, as well as black metal bands Immortal and Watain.

The project which would become Deavhronun was started in  early 2015 by singer and guitarist Tom O'Dell (also of glam/thrash band P.I.N.K LÃ¼ng) as a melodic metalcore outfit. Burning through a number of iterations  - and, indeed, names, including Scorned Devotion and Spilled Thunder - the project shifted from a side project to O'Dell's main preoccupation with the demise of his previous band, Ripstone. 

At around this time, the project began to take on a heavier feel, moving from melodic metalcore to melodic death metal. The shift in emphasis was accompanied by a shift in moniker - first to 'Aknu', meaning 'The Void' in J.R.R. Tolkien's Black Speech, and then to 'Deavhronun', meaning 'Dethroned'. Deavhronun re-recorded demos originally produced during the Scorned Devotion/Spilled Thunder era and these formed the basis of the band's first EP, 'Take the Stand', released in March 2016. The band is currently working on a second EP. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deavhronun">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
