Skanttod is a Black Metal band with it's own epic and raw sound. It has a very cold atmosphere and the sound sometimes gave me chills. Some songs are rather depressive and some are typically fast, those songs also contain different tunes like a classical Choir, Natural sounds or a Speech, but mostly the sounds of war and the death screams which make the music epical. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skanttod">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
