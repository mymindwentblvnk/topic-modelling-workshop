A fast paced Death metal riffing with black metal influences here and there and a bit of Swedish melody now and again to be unoriginal..LOL.

Not all influences are visible on these few songs,check other sites for more songs

History:

A solo project since 1995,when I arrived in Australia.

It's Death Metal,nothing original,It may all sound the same to the untrained ear,but thats what it's supposed to be.

Till death do us part...love it or lump it. 

This is nothing special,just recorded in my toilet,no flashy equipment to fool anyone,no studio buffs to polish the crap,it's just me,...LOL...

It's basically to just to get my music out there as simple as possible.

Download it,share it,rip it ..all for free like it should be.

Also I would like to mention that I was automatically transfered to this site[garageband.com] from MP3.com in 2003/4[?]when they closed down and now I have automatically appeared here on Last.fm...iLike...what next?
