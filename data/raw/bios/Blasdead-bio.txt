Blasdead is a Japanese heavy/power metal created in the early 90s.

Blasdead has been around for more than 10 years, ever since guitarist Shoji Yasuno formed the band in June 1990 in Yokohama-city. The band's powerful live performances and high-energy concerts quickly established Blasdead in the local metal scene. After changing vocalists in 1991, the band released its first demo tape in July 1992, which was offered free to the band's loyal following. The second demo tape was released the following March and sold quite a few copies. But even though the band was growing in popularity, the vocalist, drummer and bassist had all quit the band by March 1994, leaving Yasuno to keep Blasdead alive on his own.

By January 1995 Blasdead was back, with new members and new music. The band's third demo tape was released in May and generated interest from Japanese indie label Lard Records. After contributing an unreleased track to the Lard compilation Initiation in November 1995, Blasdead was set to unveil its debut CD. Another Dimension was released in July 1996, a solid slab of melodic speed metal that included new versions of selected demo tracks plus some killer new material.

With one CD under its belt, Blasdead took their tunes on the road and toured extensively across Japan. In 1997, however, the band parted ways with vocalist Jeff Rowe and had to suspend its activities while searching for a suitable replacement. After auditioning numerous candidates for the vocal slot, Blasdead was finally complete again in 1998 as Shuji Izaki became the new singer. Unfortunately, in the meantime, Lard Records had closed its doors, leaving Blasdead with no record label for their next release.
 
In 2007, they release a new album under the name of "Ground Flare". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blasdead">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
