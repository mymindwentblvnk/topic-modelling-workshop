Winterfire were formed from the ashes of local band Eternal Winter* (aka the beckoning silence) by Peter Hewitt, Martin Fitzharris and Will Farrell and are based in the North West of England.

 The upcoming debut album was written and recorded by the 3 of us, driven by the vision of great, easy to listen to melodies with technical elements and the feel of classic british metal blended with a more modern european sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Winterfire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
