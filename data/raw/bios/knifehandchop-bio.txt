Knifehandchop is Billy Pollard from Toronto, Canada, who has been programming electronic beats since he was 18.

Knifehandchop’s music is hard to describe because of the huge variety of influences and styles he pulls together, although none of these ever seem out of place in the mix. Each release is refreshing and different from the last, largely due to the diverse musical elements he uses; ragga, techno, hardcore, hip-hop and electro all make an appearance. When he plays live, he focuses mostly on the most dancefloor-killing material he has, to try to turn any bar or club into a full-on rave.

Knifehandchop's music is released on vinyl and CD on a variety of labels, although Tigerbeat6 (Oakland, California / http://www.tigerbeat6.com/) and Irritant (London, England/ http://www.irritantrecords.com/) are the most recent, releasing 'Rockstopper' and 'Bling the Noize' respectively. Promotion for the records was a 30-date tour of Europe and Japan in 2003, and a further 23 European shows this past May and June. The first of the two tours saw him stop off to record a Peel Session for BBC Radio One, and he also recently recorded a Breezeblock session for the same station.

The newest Knifehandchop releases are the totally illegal DJ mix split CD with DJ Aneurysm ('Shotgun Wedding vol.2'), a 12” split single with Panacea from Germany ('Street Chic'), and a 12” single called 'Triple Threat' on Tigerbeat6.

Upcoming releases on Tigerbeat6 include the 'Techno-Gaiden' 12" which features remixes from Modeselektor, Com.a, Rotator and Belladonnakillz.

The latest Knifehandchop full length CD, 'How I Left You', was just released in August on Tigerbeat6 records in America and on Very Friendly Records in Europe.
