Foreskin is a Pakistani Metal formed by Hassan Umer and Amar Ali, with the aim of playing raw, punky speed/thrash metal straight from the 80s. Starting out as a Crossover Thrash band with short and to the point songs, they have had several line up changed. The most recent line up that recorded the Anger Management Demo (the latest release after the BITP demo) is Hassan Umer, Amar Ali and Sheraz Ahmed. The new lineup plays more towards pure thrash with death metal and crossover influences.
