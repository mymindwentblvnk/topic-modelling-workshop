Taigen and Kohhei met playing in their own bands on the same bill in early 2007 and were later joined by Monchan and Yuki. The band booked into a studio on Hackney Road and in summer 2007, after continual 12 hour jams they played the first “true” Bo Ningen show at the Wilmington Arms. They then set up their own night 'Far East Electric Psychedelic' at Cross Kings in Kings Cross. They have since played shows and festivals throughout the UK, Europe and Japan, notably The 2011 Venice Biennale (in collaboration with artists Tim Noble and Sue Webster), which was re-created for Yoko Ono's Meltdown Festival at Royal Festival Hall, they were also invited to perform at The Victoria And Albert Museum's Yohji Yamamoto Friday Late event.

They have performed collaboratively with Damo Suzuki, Faust and Savages (band). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bo+Ningen">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
