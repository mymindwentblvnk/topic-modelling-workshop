Larkin Grimm (born in Memphis, Tennessee, on 18 September 1981) is an American singer-songwriter and musician currently based in Providence, RI) 

Though born in Memphis, TN, in a religious order called Holy Order of MANS, Grimm grew up in Dahlonega, Georgia, in the foothills of the Appalachians with a family of singers and fiddlers. 

Harpoon, her debut CD, reflects these rustic influences through a modern, psychedelic filter. Larkin's intense, ecstatic voice with swirling multi-tracked patterns recalls the richness of Illuminations-period Buffy Sainte-Marie and the sparkle of Linda Perhacs. Her instrumentation includes dulcimer, pennywhistle, bells, drums and guitar.

Larkin was previously a member of the Dirty Projectors (Western Vinyl) where she astounded audiences with her mesmerizing voice. She has also played shows with folks such as Entrance, the Microphones, Viking Moses, Old Time Relijun and her brother Joe Grimm's project the Wind Up Bird. 

Her second album is called The Last Tree and was released on 10 October 2006 by Secret Eye. Larkin's third album Parplar was released October 2008. 

She collaborated with Beat Circus in 2009.

In 2017 Grimm released her album Chasing an Illusion.
