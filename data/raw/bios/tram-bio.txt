"The London space rock outfit Tram has been riding the indie scene in their native U.K. since the late '90s. Singer/songwriter Paul Anderson fronts this four-piece and together they compose trippy melodies electrified by the use of the oboe and the organ-like keyboard the harmonium. Signed to the small independent label Jetset, Tram released their debut Heavy Black Flame in fall 1999. Frequently Asked Questions followed in early 2001".
