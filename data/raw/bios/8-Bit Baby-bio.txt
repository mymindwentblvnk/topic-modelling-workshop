In computer architecture, 8-bit integers, memory addresses, or other data units are those that are 8 bits (1 octet) wide. Also, 8-bit CPU and ALU architectures are those that are based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size. '8-bit' is also a generation of microcomputers in which 8-bit microprocessors were the norm. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/8-Bit+Baby">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
