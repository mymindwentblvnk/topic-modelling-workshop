2013 saw the band release their second full length album 'Titan'. Recorded at Chamber Studio in Edinburgh and featuring cover art by Metal Hammer artist 'American Vendetta' Christian Sloan Hall, the album has seen a lot of praise from fans and critics alike for it's relentless and memorable sound. The album is available digitally from Amazon, ITunes and Spotify as well as in physical format from all shows and the bands Big Cartel store.
