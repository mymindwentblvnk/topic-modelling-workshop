Just play metal,...
Take a moment to look at your life. Your loved ones are dying, your girlfriend leaves you, friends screw you over, you hate your job, your life is going down the tubes. 
This is the world you live in. What are you going to do about it? 
Go out, grab a beer, have some fun and play your goddamn metal. And play it as loud as you possibly can. 
For time is running out and all the shit will hit the fan,... when only Seven Days Remain.

Seven Days Remain is a metalband which originates from the South of the Netherlands. Inspired by bands such as Killswitch Engage, Soilwork, Machinemade God and Hatesphere these five musicians bring you a mix of pounding beats and guitar-riffing mayhem combined with melodic elements, deep grunts, screams and clean vocals. On stage this results into an energetic, tight and above all entertaining performance! 

In 2010 the band will release their long anticipated 5-track EP recorded at TomsterProject (Tommie Bonajo/Blindsight). This release will be followed up by the extensive “Defiance Tour” throughout Holland where they will share the stage with the screamo hardcore band Liftid. This will no doubt be an experience you do not want to miss, so make sure to catch one of their shows!
