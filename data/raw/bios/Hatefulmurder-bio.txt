The band was created in the beginning of 2008, when Renan Ribeiro (guitar), Ernani Henrique (bass - RIP 2012 - died of cancer) and Diego Azevedo (drums) left their old band and decided to unite for making an aggressive and elaborated Thrash Metal.
While they were composing new material, the vocalist Felipe Lameira, friend and producer of their old band, joined them.
The single Extreme Levels Of Hate was released in 2009. Felipe stayed as vocalist until 2015, eventually recording session vocals for their first full-length No Peace.  Then they found a steady female vocalist Angelica Bastos who has been with them ever since.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hatefulmurder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
