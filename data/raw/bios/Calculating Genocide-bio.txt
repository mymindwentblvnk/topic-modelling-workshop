Calculating genocide is a death metal band from Arvada, Colorado. 

Calculating Genocide started out in 2005 as two douche bags (Chris Van Cleave and T.J Brewster) Writing a bunch of shitty music and probably annoying a lot of people with their music. In 2007 another douche bag who was unusually tall (Kevin Peregrine) joined to make the shitty band even shittier. Then in December of 2007 the three douche bags flew over to Africa and enslaved a howler monkey. They named the little bastard Stevie and he has been the vocalist ever since. However they got on the wrong flight home from Africa and ended up in Mexico. On their walk North back home they came across a little Mexican douche bag pulling a donkey with a bunch of brightly colored blankets (why you need blankets in Mexico is beyond me) but anyway they asked the little Mexican douche bag, "Hey can you play bass?" And the little Mexican douche bag replied, "Que?" So they gave him a bass and that was the start of the most horrible band on the face of this shitty planet. The end.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/calculating+genocide">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
