VIGILIA MORTUM, a Kohtla-JÃ¤rve, Estonia based brutal Death Metal band, began life in 1994 billed as MANUSCRIPT and debuted the following year with the three track 'Inquisition' demo. The opening band formation counted vocalist Radik Kaverin, guitarists Denis Savitski and Sergei Bashilov and bassist Denis Zdanovich. Subsequently, drummer Victor Petrov completed the roster. Line-up changes in the Summer of 1996 saw the exit of Bashilov and the induction of Alex Kobzar on guitar and drummer Sass Kuzmin as the evolution to VIGILIA MORTUM took place. This would be capitalised on with a 1997 cassette 'Transformation To The Dust'. VIGILIA MORTUM's membership would prove contantly fluid, drummer Konstantin Erly saw action between 1996 and 1997 before Sass Kuzmin took over and Roman Denisenko of ARMAGGEDON was installed on guitar as Kobzar decamped to join POSTMORTEM. In 1998 the bass position went to Dmitry Savin as the demo 'Shadows Of The Dead City' emerged. An album, 'Invoking', saw release in 1999. Drummer Alex Safronov bowed out in 2000 and the following year the group lost the services of bass player Denis Zdanovich and guitarist Roma Denisenko.

In 2002 the group was overhauled completely with the introduction of four MEATOPATHY members, guitarists Aleksandr and Dmitriy Samorukov, bassist Pavel and drummer Boris Hreptukov. This entire quartet opted out in 2003.

VIGILIA MORTUM's final album 'Bloody Remorse' was released in 2005 through Blacksmith Productions.

The band split in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vigilia+Mortum">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
