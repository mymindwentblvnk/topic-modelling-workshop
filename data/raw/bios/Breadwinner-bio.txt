Breadwinner, based out of Richmond Virginia, was comprised of: Pen Rollings (guitar), Bobby Donne (bass), and Chris Farmer (drums), also drummer for German Version. Their music is the definition of math rock, a calculated and electrifying mash-up of metal signatures. Merge Records released two 7-inch singles and one full-length CD, "The Burner" (1994) after the band had broken up.
