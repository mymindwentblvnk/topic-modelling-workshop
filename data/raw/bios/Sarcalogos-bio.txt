Philosophy

The "Christian Satan" is a theological construct used as a fear tactic to herd people into a set of beliefs. Sarcalogos sees satan as the ultimate opposite. Not a figure, not somebody that ever existed but as the absolute opposite of what organized religious groups want you to believe. Sarcalogos' black art is loosely based on these "guidelines":

- Reject all forms of organized religion
- Follow natural instinct
- Stray from the herd mentality
- Feel no guilt for so called "sin"
- Find strength through living without the guilt & pressures of religion <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sarcalogos">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
