This particular band was conceived in a bar after too many shots of irish whiskey and an intense discussion over the state of music. Two guys who were working for an independent music distributor became sick of the crap bands and crappier records that are released and disappear before they make it onto a store shelf and decided to tap into what got them into music in the beginning. Memories of the original 120 Minutes, Rikki and Headbangers Ball, WNUR's Fast and Loud, the days when bands released cassettes, liking Jawbox way before Fugazi, and 10 band metal matinees at the Gateway Theater came to mind and the seed was planted. They reached out to old friends that they remembered from the days of all ages shows and swapping mix tapes and the band fell into place. Imagine saddling up in an improvised noise group with the guitar player of your first high school cover band, familiar, but not rocking the same old Minor Threat or Husker Du song. Their sound is based in the common musical past that brought them together and is unwound and bullied back with the energy of individual influences into eight minute epics. crushing. melodic. intense. graceful. manic. pummelling. introspective. The name of this band is Unfortunaut. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Unfortunaut">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
