Baaz from WÃ¼rzburg first came into contact with
electronical music in 1997, by the age of 15, when by chance his attention
was attracted by "Homework" from Daft Punk.
Apart from the big interest in Hip Hop, it was heading more and more for
electronical music with a 4/4 beat from then on.
It continued with the first bought records, Germany/Hessen's club landscape, and
music by Perlon, Basic Channel and the early Playhouse sound towards housemusic.
Around 2000 he encountered the music of Theo Parrish, Moodymann and more
stuff from US, that remaind the biggest and most importand influences so far.
At about that time the first DJ gigs and the motivation to produce music
himself came about.
After 7 years and some demos, his first record appeared on Agnes' swiss
label Sthlmaudio in december 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Baaz">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
