Svidgar brings a clear mix of joyfull melodies and battlesongs within a collar of strong metal. Also called: Epic viking battle metal. Our music is based on happy folkriffs in combination with powerful metal and tight drums. The band is established in 2004 in 's-Hertogenbosch by Niels, Martijn and Antoine. After some line-up and bandname changes, Svidgar was born. We became a folkmetalband with a strong tendency to melodic and hero√Øc aspects. This gave birth to the song "Northland Warrior", a melodic and fast, though heavy, song that is about northern warriors who battle to stay alive. After a period of songwriting and rehearsals, the band recorded a demo. This demo contains four songs which can be downloaded from our official website. In 2006, Svidgar released their first MCD called "Carry Us To War".
