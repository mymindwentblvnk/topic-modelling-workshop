A COLD DEAD BODY is a musical project born in 2005, when Sten starts a research focused on
noise. In 2007, whit the progressive arrival of Lorenzo, Cris, Shizu the project turns into
a real band. With this new line-up, A Cold Dead Body evolve progressively their sound: folk
melodies blend with doom-metal atmospheres while a new-wave vein plays with grimmers of
psychedely. After touring Italy and Austria, the band takes a break for recording the debut album in
April 2009. "Harvest Years" takes shape at Mushroom Studio thanks to Enrico Berto, under the
supervision of Lorenzo Della Rovere (PrimadellapioggiAggiungi un appuntamento per oggia,
Robert of the Square), and finally comes to life with the mastering of James Plotkin. Nine songs as
nine pictures, portraits of a landscape which crosses the boundaries of the man-made reality to
reconnect with the Earth. Ancient lessons to recover for those who want to listen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Cold+Dead+Body">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
