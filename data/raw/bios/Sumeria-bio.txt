1) In 1977, disco producers Alec R. Costandinos and Don Ray hooked up for another one-off project called Sumeria. The group's only album, "Golden Tears", was a concept record that loosely explores modern identity in the late 1970's without ever moving too far from the dancefloor. This LP, in my opinion is one of the best cosmic disco concept albums of all-time. There's just as much pre-song dialog between two confused lovers as actual music on the record to dance to. Where skits and dialog intros fail to make any connection to the listener or the music, Costandinos and Ray get it right on this album, the dialog actually makes the the music make more sense and tends to tie up the entire record. 

2) Raw black metal from California. To date they have released two full-length albums: "Legends" (2003) and "All Paths Lead to Insanity" (2006). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sumeria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
