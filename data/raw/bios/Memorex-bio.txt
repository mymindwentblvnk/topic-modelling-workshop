2)Established in 1961 in Silicon Valley, Memorex is today a consumer electronics brand of Imation specializing in disk recordable media (CD & DVD Drives), travel drives, flash storage, computer accessories and other electronics. Memorex entered the consumer business in 1971 first with its "shattering glass" advertisements and then with a series of famous television commercials featuring Ella Fitzgerald. In the commercials she would sing a note that shattered a glass while being recorded to a Memorex audio cassette. The tape was played back and the recording also broke the glass, asking "Is it live, or is it Memorex?" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Memorex">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
