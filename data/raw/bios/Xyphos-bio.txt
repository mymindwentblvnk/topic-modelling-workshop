Started in 2009 by Ahmed Ali as an outlet for some seriously kickass death metal, Xyphos started slowly, but began to pick up speed when he met drummer Brody Overfalle and George Larin. With this lineup they started searching for a bassist and a vocalist, all the while working hard at creating death metal that would play to each of their diverse interests. Shortly after, they met and auditioned bassist/vocalist Rory Kennedy of Serene Molestation. He was a perfect fit, his playing style and musical interests fitting the band well, and they started to write in earnest. Soon after, the band had almost a full set of material written, but were sadly forced to part ways with guitarist George Larin due to musical differences. This allowed the band to bring in guitarist/vocalist Andrew Power, also of Serene Molestation. His addition thickened up the sound, and his guttural vocal style adds a whole new level of brutality. It was with this lineup that Xyphos entered the studio with Geoff Hodsman in July 2010 to record the debut EP, "What Comes Before", which is scheduled for a late 2010 release. Be prepared for what this band is about to unleash!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Xyphos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
