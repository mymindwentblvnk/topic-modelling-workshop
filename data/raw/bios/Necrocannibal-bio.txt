Necrocannibal was a death/grind metal band from Russia in early 90. They are most known for their start album "Somnambuliformic Posession", released in 1993. After releasing album on an MC, they did a supporting tour and then disbanded, due to the lack of interest (disregarding the success of the album) and common situation in russian metal community at this time.

There are some other projects with this name, however, most photos here, including official avatar at the moment of this writing, and the band members photo belong to the russian band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necrocannibal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
