"Formerly known as "Under Authority", Prophets of War began as a slap-together band for a small church youth group. Paul and Sean, with Henk joining not long after, spent friday nights covering well known Christian music to offer the youth a chance to worship our Lord. Soon this music evolved, like the band, to employ an anthemic, melodious, heavy metal sound that still offers the youth that same experience today. With the addition of Dave on drums (and his addition of the double kick pedal), Prophets of War began crafting songs of their own. This is the passion and calling of Prophets of War; to play heavy, loud music to worship and glorify our God." - Prophets Of War MySpace
