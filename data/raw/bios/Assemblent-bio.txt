"Assemblent started in 2002 by Daniel [guitars], Carlos [bass], Sérgio [vocals], César [drums] and Pedro [keyboards & synths].

In 2003 the first - two song [Heartwork and Silent Cries] - demo was recorded at Estúdio Zero [Portugal].

After gigging on underground base events and clubs around Portugal, the band teamed up with producer Miguel Fonseca [Thormenthor, Plastica, Mofo, Bizarra Locomotiva] to record their first LP Equilibrium in late summer 2004 at the Red Light Studios [Portugal]. Fernando Ribeiro [Moonspell] appears as vocal guest on the track Silent Cries.

By the end of 2005 César left the band and Nuno took the place behind the drum kit. December 24th marks the signing of a two record deal with Portuguese label Nemesis.

Assemblent's sound gathers varied influences, reflection of the different personalities of its members. Even though, bands such as Carcass/Moonspell/My Dying Bride/Samael surface as the mainstay. The result is Death/Thrash Metal crossed-over atmospheric soundscapes."
