Door Into Emptiness are a black metal band from Belarus
Demo 2007
Serpents age

As the pathway
That fell in dreamless slumber
In high grass
Shalt lead to the water
The fortress of fog
Shalt fall to the bottom
In dust
And my liberated blood
Shalt breathe the smell of wind

Gazing at the skies
I am tearing my veins open
I shall rip my body to shreds
I desire to become a cloud
