Biography (taken from their official myspace page)

"Molestation was founded in summer 2006 in Ilmenau, Thuringia by members of four different bands (e.g. Diemantic and Sudden Death). The band of drummer Unas was about to crack because of some members going to the army and so Unas was searching musicians to darken the fuckin' sky over Thuringia. At a small Open Air Festival Diddo joined the unborn metal bastard to cruciate the six strings, the King himself was recruted for the 4-string-job and the hairy Dr. Young got pressed the microphone into his not so hairy fingers. The bataillon was complete and some weeks later the first rehearsal was celebrated in the pseudo-legendary Baracke 5. For a very long period the formation did not have a real band name, Black Vulva and Mortem were shitty as fuck - so the four black-hearted Death-Metal-Heads stand united under a conquering flag with "Molestation" written on it. Have a nice day.

But the armored devastation commando has already one man down - battery tormentor Unas left the band because of moving to another city for studying and conquering new musical territories. So we are proud to introduce our new drum animal Stefan who joined the Army of Molestation in October 2007.

At the summer of 2008 we recorded our first Studio EP "Death Comes Drinking" in "The Unholy Studio". After that work we played some gigs on different concerts, open airs and festivals.

Now at the beginning of 2009 we want to release our finished CD and want play some gigs!" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Molestation">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
