SEDULITY was formed in early 2009 by original members Tony C, JD Palomares and Jordan Elcess. Tyler Oulton joined shortly after as well. The four started as a band local to Tucson playing shows opening for national acts like Flotsam and Jetsam. They quickly recorded their first demo and subsequent six track EP “Integral Spirits” showcasing a modern thrash sound with heavily influence from melodic death metal and latter era Death. The band went through some lineup issues and ended up on long term hiatus. However, when Masters of Metal Productions started, releases were needed and so Tony C offered to put Integral Spirits up on the label's site for the sake of material. This revived an interest in the project, and JD Palomares expressed interest to return as well. The two enlisted the help of Lascaille’s Shroud Brett Windnagle for additional lead guitar, and Tyler Sherrill of Steamforged for additional composition and keyboard arrangements. "The Valley of Dying Stars” marked their first full length album release and sparked a revived interest in the band.  Originally Tony and JD were not going to continue it, however, after Valley, drummer Jordan Elcess returned to the band and the three decided to continue work on the band and start playing shows and writing a follow up album.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sedulity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
