Existench was a crustgrind 4-piece from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Forming around 1991 under the name Disabuse, the initial line-up consisted of: Drock Liverotchee - Guitars / Vox, Pete - Vox / Guitar, Amanda - Bass, and Gerald - Drums. Two demos, a 7'' EP and various compilation appearances were released until their name change. Musically and lyrically comparable to the likes of Extreme Noise Terror, Napalm Death, Sore Throat and Doom, Existench began playing locally and were incredibly well-received - soon gaining recognition across the international scene. Pete left the band, moved to the USA and was eventually replaced by new guitarist, Ryan. Drock quit for a little while - later rejoining - and taking over his place was Dillon Burke (ex-Anti-Trust); who ended up playing on 'Blood Money'. Ryan then left and moved to Ontario. Existench Never really broke up, just faded away! Members now play in System Shit and Thy Flesh Consumed.
