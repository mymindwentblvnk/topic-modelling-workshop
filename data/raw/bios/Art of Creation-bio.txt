A small sized big aiming young local multi metal band from Zvolen, Slovakia. Mostly metal riffing, but also nice soft tunes often mixed with odd drumming and a not so typical metal sound. Influenced mostly by all kinds of guitar music, from heavy, to rock, to death, even acoustic stuff or progy. The band also love to work with emotions, dynamic changes, harmonies and play on words. The lyrcis are positive, dealing with different topics from love, to society, to personal issues. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Art+of+Creation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
