“Long long time ago our ancestor from one of the middle east countries called Yemen, they didn’t have any idea on how to make modern music. Til the day, they crossed the sea and finally found the paradise country called “Indonesia”, they stayed there still and had a lot more generations. Today, we, their lineages, meet and share the same sense of music, taste and joke, we decided to make that modern music which didn’t exist in those days. We called ourselves Kaveh Kanes.

Kaveh Kanes is a lo-fi/ambient  pop band from Yogyakarta, Indonesia, which formed by the end of 2011. We’re looking forward to release new album in 27th November 2015 called " Capital"
