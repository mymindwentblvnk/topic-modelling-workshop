A Melodic Black Metal band from Italy. The band was formed in 2000. They released one demo in 2005 (Oblivion) and one full-length album in 2006 (Graveyard Ballades). The band combines melodic guitar riffs, medium-paces to fast drumming with various keyboard effects like pianos, church organs, strings etc. so their music fits into the symphonic black metal genre. The band is still active and other albums are to be released.
