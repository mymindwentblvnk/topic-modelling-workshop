Necro Schizma were a death/doom band active from 1989 to around 1990. They released a demo titled "Erupted Evil" in 1989 and a demo titled "Necrocarnation" in 1990. "Erupted Evil" has since been reissued with bonus live material on CD through From Beyond Productions.

Necro Schizma are known as innovators in the death/doom genre, being one of the earliest bands to play bona fide, purely slow paced extreme doom.
