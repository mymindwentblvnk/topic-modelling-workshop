Azealia Amanda Banks is an American rapper, singer, songwriter and actress. Raised in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, she began releasing music through Myspace in 2008 before being signed to XL Recordings at age 18. In 2011, her debut single "212" went viral and entered several international charts. Banks subsequently signed with Interscope and Polydor Records before later separating in July 2013. Banks ultimately became an independent artist and started her own independent record label, Chaos & Glory Recordings, after multiple negative experiences with previous labels.

Banks has released three mixtapes (Fantasea in 2012, Slay-Z in 2016 and Yung Rapunxel: Pt.II in 2019), one studio album (Broke with Expensive Taste in 2014) and two extended plays (1991 in 2012 and Icy Colors Change in 2018). Her long-delayed second and third studio albums, Fantasea II: The Second Wave and Business & Pleasure, await release. The lead singles from each respective album, "Anna Wintour" and "Black Madonna" were released in April 2018 and June 2020 respectively.

In early 2017, Banks launched her online store, CheapyXO. The site sells spiritual items, artist merchandise from Banks and most notably, original skin-care products. In December 2017, she had her film debut in the musical drama Love Beats Rhymes, receiving positive reviews for her performance as the lead actress in the film.

Throughout her career, Banks' social media presence and outspoken views, especially on U.S. politics and race, have attracted significant controversy, criticism, and media scrutiny. She has developed a reputation for having disputes with public figures on Twitter. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Azealia+Banks">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
