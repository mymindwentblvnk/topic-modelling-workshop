Ides of Gemini are Black Math Horseman's Sera Timms (vocals/bass), veteran music and film journalist J. Bennett (guitar/backing vocals) and Kelly Johnston (drums/backing vocals).

In 2010, Timms and Bennett recorded and self-released a four-song EP, The Disruption Writ. Later Johnston joined the band, and in 2012 they released their full-length debut, Constantinople.

â€œJ. Bennett lays down imperial metal riffs swathed in so much reverb that they seem isolated from the rest of the world. Sera Timms layers her affectless voice in ghostly counterpoint, turning tales of spiritual discord into disturbing lullabies".
