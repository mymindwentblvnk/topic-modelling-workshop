Rob Mayth grew up in a family where music was an element of daily life and started learning the piano at only 8 years old. He later switched to computers as the piano wasn't quite what he was looking for. In 1996 he started using programs like "Dance Machine" and "Magic Music Maker." These, however, didn't give him many chances to use his creativity, so he continued using the semi-professional "Fruity Loops" for a time, which he produced Thunderdome and Melodic-Hardcore tracks with. He released those tracks on pages like MyOwnMusic and Virtual-Volume and soon made them accessible to a bigger audience. He realized that he had gotten a lot of feedback and in turn soon recorded his first Demo CD which he applied to several labels with, but to no avail. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rob+Mayth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
