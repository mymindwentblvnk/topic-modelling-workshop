A Lapponian metal project, Urskog (Primeval Forest) seeks to paint the forces of nature in sound. Employing a DIY approach, each song is composed, written and released by Urskog's sole member Anders Persson. 

The royalties (after tax) from the digital sales of the new single 'Sprider sporer' (Spreading spores) will be donated to Greenpeace. All support is appreciated.
