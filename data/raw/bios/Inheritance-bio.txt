There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Inheritance is a project that is based on already broken up post-metal band Dawn To Come. The band members whereabouts are starting in Presov (Slovak Republic) and ending up in Brno(Czech Republic). But the distance and lack of rehearsals could not stop them to create something amazing. This is supported by the fact that band will be playing with Irish [ God is An Astronaut ] or American [ Pontiak ].

Inheritance is a mixture of guitar, piano and drums. The music could be related to modern fusion/post-jazz scene wrapped in ambient nuance. Arrhythmical guitar riffs accompanied by classical tones of piano and glued by pre-calculated groove drums.
