The band around singer Manuel Wintjen has played since its foundation in 2012 on almost every well-known stage in Germany and also internationally, among others. as support to Deez Nuts, Caliban, Pyogenesis, Emil Bulls or ZSK. The wide-ranging fanbase, which consists of both metal and hardcore fans, as well as punk rock fans, underlines that.

Anthemic punk rock with a proper dose of metal or full-on metal with the unapologetic punch of punk rock? It’s with great pride that Redfield Records is announcing the newest signing ANCHORS & HEARTS.

For the experienced band the coalition with Redfield Records for the fourth long player, is a career highlight nonetheless, while the label has always been one of the anchors not only in the German scene and therefore a desirable goal: “We have been following the label since the beginnings and been celebrating many of the bands coming out there. To now be a part of the Redfield Family, is a huge honour for us.”

The new second  single ‘What If God Was One of Them’ is a furious, emotionally and politically charged, punk infused metalcore track. “I had the idea for this song when ‘One of Us’ by Joan Osborne came on the radio. In the lyrics she describes that God is practically everywhere – he could be one of us. But what if you look at this from a negative perspective? What if God wasn’t on the good side?”, says singer Manuel Wintjen.
