1) A talented 20 year-old singer songwriter from London, England. Who plays the drums, guitar and piano has been working on his first EP for the past couple of years, including the songs : "I Am", "The State" and "Don't Tell Me". Previously in punk band 'Growing Pains' West has finally released some solo material.

2)A mostly self-taught musician from Savannah, Georgia, West has developed a highly personal sound using unusual tunings and a dazzling combination of bluesy slide work, finger-picking, simultaneous bass line/melody work, and unorthodox percussive techniques. Add to this West's "brilliant original compositions" (Oakland Tribune) and his work as founder and leader of Curvature, and you see why he is rapidly creating a buzz on the west coast.

A prolific composer, West has just completed his fifth release for Ahead Behind Music. Three of these recordings have received national recognition for their exceptional quality as independently produced CD's. As We Know It was recently chosen over thousands of entries as winner of the Acoustic Guitar Magazine Self-Released CD Award for its "superb quality and originality." West's recordings are also featured regularly on NPR's "All Things Considered".  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jack+West">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
