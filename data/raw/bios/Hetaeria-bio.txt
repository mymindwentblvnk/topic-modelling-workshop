Hetaeria was founded in September 2001 in Einbeck, Germany.
Their first song was "Sadistic Sins of Flesh", which they still play during their live acts today. This first song was published on the second DarkBound Sampler in 2002.

In july 2003 they recorded their first album, "Heretical Inspiration", in the Dunkel-Wald-Productions studio in Kassel. It was later released by Perverted Taste. The album was limited to 500 copies only.

On October, 11th 2004 the band recorded a "Rehearsel", which was also limited to 50 copies.

Up until now the band is working on new songs which they intend to release on a demo tape sometime soon (or not so soon).
