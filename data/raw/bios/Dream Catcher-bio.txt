Dream Catcher: THE Dutch Symphonic Metal band of this time: A guaranteed pleasure for the ears... AND eyes!!

Dream Catcher, complete with six crazy, enegry-full musicians, won't let young and old get bored with her theatrical act. The songs are very symphonic, have lots of strong guitar riffs and is combined with superb soprano singing. With the classical educated Rianne Wilbers as lead-singer, Dream Catcher is capable of conquering main audience.

The music of Dream Catcher has a lot of influences from the classical corner of the history of music that is translated by some amazing keyboard pieces, classical sing melodies and, where the Metal part comes to the light, the brutal guitar riffs combined with a very tight rhythm section. Because of this mix of music styles, Dream Catcher knows how to create their own sound and style. Knowing elements in the songs are romance and passion. One thing is for sure: The listener won't forget this experience!

Thanks to the crowd of fans who is keeping Dream Catcher alive, they know how to make a success of every gig!! Dream Catcher, who only plays own material during the shows, started once as an inexperienced school band and is now grown as a full-fledged Symphonic Metal Band!!!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dream+Catcher">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
