Hellsteed is a blackened death metal band and was formed in autumn 2008 by drummer Tom, bassist/vocalist Joss and guitarist/vocalist Chris. They formed to make an extreme band who's philosophy was making metal with spirit and integrity. They cite their influences as Behemoth, Immortal, Vader, Emperor, Judas Priest, Carcass and Bolt Thrower, amongst others, and claim that life itself is the main lyrical theme.

In late 2008 they released the Devoured by Wolves demo and in July 2009 the Bastion of Cruelty demo.

The band performed their first gig on the 6th August 2009 at the Wedgewood Rooms, Portsmouth, in a band showcase where they were voted a close second place. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hellsteed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
