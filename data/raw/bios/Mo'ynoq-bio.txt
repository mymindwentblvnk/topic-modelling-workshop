From the southern hills emerges Mo'ynoq, an American Black Metal outfit from Raleigh, North Carolina that brandishes feral riffs and a uniquely humid atmosphere. 2016 bore witness to their demo released on limited edition cassette. The four-piece released their EP: “Bardo” on 7” vinyl in 2017. The band released their debut LP: Dreaming in a “Dead Language” in January 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mo%27ynoq">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
