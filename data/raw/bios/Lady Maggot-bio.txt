Lady Maggot was formed in Dublin, Ireland in 2010 as a project between friends Martyna ‘Moyra Noise’ Hałas and Piotr ‘Niemiec’ Niemczewski. 

Both hailing from Bydgoszcz, Poland; Martyna and Piotr incorporate over a decade of solid music writing and a variety of different influences and musical experiences that they bring from their past projects.

Piotr’s metal approach to music writing and his guitar technique were perfected throughout the years in death metal bands such as Mortis Dei and Puki Mahlu, and Martyna’s experimental but ever so slightly catchy vocals are a result of participating in stylistically different projects and bands: ranging from an experimental metal project Galexia, through a one-off pop-electronic affair with Liu Cain, to her current rock act with a 70s vibe Photosonic Orchestra. 

Piotr and Martyna’s paths meet right here. Lady Maggot: darkness meets light, dirt meets clarity, yin meets yang. 

Lady Maggot have recorded an EP called ‘Umbra’ starring Dariusz Hałas (ex Lord Vader) in June 2011 and are currently working on their debut full length album. Live gigs will follow with a full line-up. Stay tuned! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Maggot">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
