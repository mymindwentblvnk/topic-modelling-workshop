Sinister Angel was formed in 1983. Original members included... Greg Bolton (guitar), Billy May (vocals), Rick Norris (drums) and Jim Staggers (bass). The main thrust of influence at the time of formation was Iron Maiden, Alice Cooper, Judas Priest, etc. The band produced one 4 song ep and there were only 1000 copies of that ep made. The purpose of the ep originally was.... to do it , just to do it... and to give them out to club owners for auditions. It has become one of the most sought after rare collectable metal albums around. The band broke up in 1985. Reformed in 1998 and has had their share of tragedies over the last 10 years that has caused much delay in production of their new CD. Billy, Greg, and Rick all live in the Atlanta Georgia area and are presently writing and recording.. They have a myspace page that stays relatively current.. myspace.com/sinisterangelband <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sinister+Angel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
