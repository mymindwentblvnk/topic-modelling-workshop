History
Witchkiller was a NWOBHM-inspired band from Ottawa, Canada started by Steve Batky and Kurt Phillips. Delving into Power & Epic heavy metal they released four demos and the classic Metal Blade "Day of the Saxons" EP in 1984 . 
Original vocalist Doug Adams was gone shortly thereafter as was guitarist Kurt Phillips. Steve Batky continued on with replacement players eventually folding the project and moving to L.A. where he launched I, Napoleon. He eventually developed a leather goods company in the L.A. area. 
Doug Adams went to Toronto outfit Reckless with bassist Todd Pilon, recording a few albums which failed to ignite the music world. Doug then went on to ignite the world with the internationally acclaimed pyro company Pyrotek. 
Kurt Phillips re-located to Los Angeles for a brief stint with Metal Blade label mates Savage Grace before returning to Canada. He currently leads the Power Metal band WARHAG off of Vancouver Island, a continuation of the style pioneered with Witchkiller.
