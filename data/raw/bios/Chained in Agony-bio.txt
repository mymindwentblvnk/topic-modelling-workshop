Experimental death metal band from Croatia.

Chained in Agony was formed in the winter of 2004 by a couple of old friends. In 2005 band started work on their songs, original guitarist Edo Simec was replaced, and since then the line up has not changed. They recorded a four song demo in 2007 called ‘The Agony Has Just Begun’, followed by numerous shows in Croatia. After few breaks in work the band decided to take a turn in music direction, and start writing more aggressive and mature material. In 2010 DIY demo ‘Mind Abortion’ was recorded, and followed by band's biggest tour in 2011. Today band is working on new material for thier third DIY demo and preparing for new tour in 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chained+In+Agony">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
