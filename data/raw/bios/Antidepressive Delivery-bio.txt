ADD was formed in 2002 by Kråbøl and Broholt. After playing with various metal bands in Norway, they wanted to
do something more in the spirit of the great 70's progressive rock-bands.
After a couple of demos they released the album "Feel,Melt,Release,Escape" on Laser's Edge
records in sept. 04. The music was described as classic progressive rock blended with modern raw aggression, and received good reviews worldwide.
In 2006 the band parted ways with Laser's Edge, then split up, just to reform shortly after.
Late 2006, they started to make music for a new album. Now the band's music was evolving into a far less aggressive sound spiced with influences of early jazz-rock.
The album "Chain of foods" was recorded in Skansen Lydstudio in 2007, and without a record deal, the band decided to release the music on their own.
"Chain of foods" is now available for free to download through Antidepressive Delivery's own website: www.add.swarmling.net
