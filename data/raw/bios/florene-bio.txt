"We kicked off the year in grand style with Florene’s ‘Deal with it’, Motorik music for a place with no roads, that’s the way we put it. That numinous beast is to be included in their forthcoming (and aptly titled) ‘Homemade Extacy’ (out in June).

Space Cadet ends it they way it should:  dance music made in the same way in which others design their characters for a suicide incursion into expanses of space where chaos reigns supreme and crawling monstrosities roam unfettered- think of that same same vein of epic euro-techno that the Knife mined in Silent Shout, but with guns. Florene just want to watch the universe burn." -www.20jazzfunkgreats.co.uk <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Florene">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
