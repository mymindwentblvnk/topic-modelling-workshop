4 Promille was an Oi!-band, formed by Volker Grüner, ex-guitarist in the band Störkraft. The band split up in 2007. In the beginning 4 Promille was a solo-project by Volker Grüner, on the LP Die "Jungs von nebenan" was the first record with other members.

Many lyrics are about consuming alcohol. After they got 2 records published by themselves the band signed by the Oi!-label Knock-Out Records who published another 2 records. 4 Promille took distance from Störkraft because of their rightist activism (in the song Splitternackt they sing "Der Jörg isn Arsch, der Jörg isn Arsch, der Jörg kommt aus Andernach" - Jörg is an ass, Jörg is an ass, Jörg is an ass, he's coming from Andernach - the song was dedicated to Jörg Petrisch, Störkraft vocalist and lyrics writer).
