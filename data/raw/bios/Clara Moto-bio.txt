Barely aged 24, Clara Moto already demonstrates an incredible maturity. After a childhood lit up by jazz and classic piano studies, she now stands up as one of the new faces of the Austrian electronic scene, having set with a couple of friends her own label Houseverbot and in organizing the reputable Birds parties at the Postgarage of Graz. Discovered at the latest editions of  Sonar and Montreux festivals, Clara cultivates a femininity and an uncommon elegance on the fringes of minimal, microhouse and electronica through her Live-, Dj-sets and her  productions. 

Supported by the likes of James Holden, Laurent Garnier, Josh Wink, Sasha or Gregor Tresher for her “Glove Affair” last year, Clara Moto is coming back this autumn with 3 new bewitched tracks permeated with an obvious “Pop” essence. Indeed, House enthusiasts will find it hard to resist the spellbinding voice of “Silently”. Young multidisciplinary artist from Graz, Mimu invites Clara`s immaculate production to a modern ballet of minimalist refinement and dance exaltation. A true anthem of white witchcraft! 

With the enigmatic « Sancy Cat », Clara pays the Berlin scene’s respect with an equally hypnotic and subtle track for the best pleasures of 24 hours party people. Enchanted this time by her own soft incantations, Clara finally propels with « Hiding in the Bottom Drawer » a whirl of clicks and cuts and 4/4 beats towards delightful pop-house heavens.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Clara+Moto">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
