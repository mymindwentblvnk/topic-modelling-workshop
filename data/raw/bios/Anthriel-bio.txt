Anthriel is a progressive metal band from Finland (Tampere), formed in 2004. 
In September 17th, they release the debut album titled "The Pathway".

Anthriel's music can be described as sort of a neo classical band with metal and progressive influences. Still it's Anthriel so it's hard to categorize the music to represent only one genre. Anthriel's music is Timo Niemisto's hand writing from many parts.
