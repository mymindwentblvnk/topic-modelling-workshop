Asgard Legionnaires is probably the first ever known Qatari heavy metal band. They formed in Doha, Qatar in 2002 and released an independent self-titled demo in 2005. Nothing else has been heard about the band ever since. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Asgard+Legionnaires">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
