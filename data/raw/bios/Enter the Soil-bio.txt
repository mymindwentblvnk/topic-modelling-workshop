A doom metal project from New Zealand, with heavy influence from early Anathema, Katatonia and My Dying Bride.

Justin Chorley began work on what would become Enter the Soil in 2008 after the disbanding of the thrash metal project he had been heavily involved in for several years. As his desire to explore deeper, darker musical territory grew, so too did his interest in home recording and in 2011, he released an EP under the band name Hirsute.

Inspired by the overwhelming response it received, Chorley began work on a full album with plans to cement his sound and earn Hirsute a place on the global doom metal stage.

With big plans for the future of his music, after much deliberation, Chorley decided to change the band name to something a little more true to his style which would better represent the music and stand the test of the time. This led to his first release under the new moniker Enter the Soil - That Amber Lit Morning, which was intended to hold true to Hirsute's established sound while delving deeper still into the dark and fascinating realm of doom metal.
