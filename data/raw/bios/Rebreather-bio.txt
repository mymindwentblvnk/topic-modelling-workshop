starting off as a sludgier rock band and slowly evolving into a weird Hum meets Milligram catchy melodic indie-rockish feel. All while still being extremely loud and heavy with the same gigantic tones of the earlier material. one of my all-time favorite bands here. fans of Eternal Elysium, Milligram, Hum, Suma, Electric Wizard, Tonerlow blahblahblahblah... these are really shitty comparisons... if you like loud rock.. check this band out if you haven't. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rebreather">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
