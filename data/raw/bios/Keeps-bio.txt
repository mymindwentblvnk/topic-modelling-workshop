Keeps began in the dead of summer, 2010, when Marc Nelson and Josh Ramon (ex members of Theanti) reunited in the village of Foresman, Indiana (population less than 50). On a 16 track recorder with a handful of microphones, heads-full of ideas, and limited instrumentation they recorded two new songs which showcased a more "pop" structure than their work as Theanti (apparently more suited for the likes of Warped Tour, having been handpicked to play founder Kevin Lyman's Kevin Says Stage in 2008). 

Deciding to bring in longtime friend/collaborator Eric Parker to thicken the low end on the mostly acoustic tracks snowballed into winter collaborations, and eventually tracking of their debut full-length in Lafayette, Indiana at Sound Logic Studios. Before the album could be finished Keeps found themselves on a Midwest tour with folk-singer Adam Faucett. 

Upon returning from tour Nelson and Ramon moved into a motel in Bloomington, IN to continue tracking on their own pro tools rigs. Spending the summer of 2011 recording in the motel and Parker's place in Indianapolis came to fruition with vocal sessions engineered by Shiraz Dada of Maps & Atlases in Chicago, IL. 

Keeps continues to write and demo new material while showcasing No Bridges to audiences around the midwest. Currently planning to properly tour abroad in 2012, including festival dates this summer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Keeps">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
