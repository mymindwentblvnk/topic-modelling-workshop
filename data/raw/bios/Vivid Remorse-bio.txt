VIVID REMORSE is an unconventional band. Formed in Barcelona in 2006, his style is based on a mixture of both classic and modern thrash with some groove, hardcore and death metal influences, and the result is a very distinctive, unique and particular sound, which combines the classic and the melody of bands such Metallica or Death Angel with the modernity of Machine Head and Pantera and the speed of Slayer and Sepultura, all mixed with huge personality. 

After recording a very succesful EP in 2009, the band released his first LP in september 2010, entitled "The Seed of Malaise." Recorded at well-known spanish recording studios Axtudio in July 2010, the album consists of 13 short tracks, diverse, powerful and dynamic, with original riffs and aggressive but melodic voices. In this album VIVID REMORSE shows everybody why it is considered one of the most original and promising metal bands in Spain, devoloping his own and particular style, a thrash without prejudices.
