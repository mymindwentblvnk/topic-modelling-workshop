There are two bands using this name.

1. Punk rock band from Umeå, Sweden.
2. Grindcore band from Belgrade, Serbia.

1. Scared formed in Umeå in 1995 and released their first record in 1996 (Oxygen E.P. on the Ampersand label). While Scared's early material is best described as fast melodic punk rock, their later songs - in particular those on the New Songs 7" and the Demo Sessions CD - belong more in the alternative rock genre. Today the members of Scared have moved on to another band Inspektionen, the main difference being that the lyrics now are sung in Swedish.

2. A grindcore band from Belgrade, Serbia, formed in 2010.
