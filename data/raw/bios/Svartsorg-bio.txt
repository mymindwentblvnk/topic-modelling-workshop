SVARTSORG was formed in autumn 2007 by Grubotnik and Lord Judas Iscariot, after a spontaneous recording session. The music is rooted in the depressive black-metal genre, although the pace and mood of the songs vary very often and therefore a unique style is evident.
In the first years the band was only a studioproject. Lyrics written by Lord Judas Iscariot and music by Grubotnik. After countless recordings, and many finished songs, the two decided to shock the masses with live performances! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Svartsorg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
