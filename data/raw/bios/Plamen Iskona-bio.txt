PLAMEN ISKONA was summoned in the middle of 2k6.
Founders of this unholy alliance were Hrym, Morpheus and Arkritel.
In the fall of 2k6 the band starts to arrange and play their own spells.
In two months songs for their first demo "Behold Dark Realm" were prepared and the demo was self-released in 100 copies.
This release helped the band to find their fourth member, V. from black/thrash metal horde Wolf's Hunger.
In the fall of 2k7 Sachnoth of black metal band BEHEST joined the band on bass and khaotik formation of li[f]e destruction is completed and the act is ready for spreading the plague with full force upon the unsuspecting masses.
