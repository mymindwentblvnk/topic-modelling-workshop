Initially formed in 1993 as a darkwave sideproject by members of famed black metal band Summoning (specifically their early lineup comprising Trifixion, Protector, Silenius, and Pazuzu himself), Pazuzu became a solo project after Pazuzu moved back to Canada in 1998. They resemble medievalists such as Dead Can Dance and Arcana, but with a darker somewhat comparable to dark ambient bands like Shinjuku Thief. Their first album also featured Empress Lilith and Minh Ninjao on backing vocals. The project's status is currently unknown, as the official Pazuzu website hasn't been updated in some time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pazuzu">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
