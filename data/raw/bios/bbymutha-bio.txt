Hailing from Chattanooga, USA, bbymutha is a female force of nature. With a soundscape heavily influenced by southern culture, she blends her life experiences into hard hitting raps.

Sometimes vulgar, and never shy, bbymutha is always open, honest, and real. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/bbymutha">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
