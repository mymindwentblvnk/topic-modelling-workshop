Roma are a 4 piece band based in Cheshire/Manchester, who following a couple of line up changes have now settled into the soaring melodic indie/rock sound that is Roma today.

Roma is also a producer/musician based in New York New York making experimental/industrianl noise music.

Original members Matt and Mark have always formed the back bone of the band, keeping the rhythm section nice and tight. After musical differences which saw the original guitarist leave, Will joined after responding to an advertisement placed in NME. He slotted in neatly, and Roma went on to perform 3 great gigs at Manchesters Night & Day café before disaster struck..

The singer went AWOL never to come back! This was a huge set back but didn't deter the band as they continued to practice every week, at their own practice room (The Shed) in the heart of Cheshire, without a singer. The long hard search was now on to find the voice which would complement their writing style. A number of ads were placed and for the following 2 years Roma were besieged by a number of young hopefuls wanting to be their new frontman. Just as it seemed they'd never find their man they made a last ditch attempt in the form of an ad on the Night & Days online message board. This time, they struck lucky! Richard Crossan answered the call and armed with his acoustic guitar and angelic voice things started to gel. Roma then holed themselves away writing brand new songs intended for their live set and demo cd. 

Today, Roma have played several high profile gigs in Manchester, including headline sets at both the Night & Day Café & the Late Room, and also supported Bauer and Haven at Manchester's Academy 3. Roma continue to write excellent music and are in the early stages of planning a national tour to further their already fast growing fan base.
