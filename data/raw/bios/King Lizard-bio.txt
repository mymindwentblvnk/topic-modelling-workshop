KING LIZARD are London’s hardest rock band ready to hit your ear drums.

The band has been leading the scene for some years but in the last year they have been on fire, and the speed at which they are taking the UK by storm is phenomenal. With two UK tours, huge London gig’s, great original tracks and a full on rock and roll show, this band are on a journey to the top.

If you haven’t seen these guys live then do it soon before they are playing to sell out crowds in huge stadiums, and you can only get your sweaty hand on tickets for the back row!! So get yourself on the mailing list to be in the loop.
