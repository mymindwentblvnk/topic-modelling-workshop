Dunkel:heit started out in the summer of '92 as a part-time industrial-style project 
containing members from the industrial metal band Red Harvest. 
After recording some songs, they decided to keep going and started recruiting more members. 
Around a year later they recorded a demo on an 8-track recorder.
Instead of pushing their demo heavily around, they band started playing around with the idea of doing a compilation CD. 
The CD, entitled "The Reincarnation Of The Sun", was released in February 1994 by Dunkel Prod. 
and contained (mostly) exclusive material from Red Harvest, Anstalt, Valhall, Dunkelheit, Remyl, Piledriver and Humid.
Shortly after this release, Suggestion Records got in touch with the band and offered a deal for a 7" EP. 
"More Than Meets The Third Eye" was recorded with four new songs and released in the summer of '94.
Pleased with the result of this 7" EP, Suggestion offered a deal for a full-length CD. 
The material was recorded in March '95, and the CD "Obey" was released in the end of the summer '95.
Since then the project was put on hold. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dunkel:heit">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
