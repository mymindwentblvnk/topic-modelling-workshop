A Rather Solemn Promise is, at heart, experimental music, Carter and Kiefer performing live improvisations directly to the recorder and is presented here edited but without a single overdub.  The beauty of the music lay it the way it which moments of droning, searching, atonal sound coalesces suddenly into chord-based, tonal music, only to fly away again.  The process continues without plan, intuitively the music breaks, connects, breaks, connects again, as Carter switches from lap steel to acoustic resonator and Kiefer switches from resonator to banjo and then to dulcimer.  Each artist’s technique informs the other: Carter’s slabs of sound pressing Kiefer’s playing into more abstract moments, and Kiefer’s tendency to search out melody encouraging similar playing from Carter’s guitar. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Tom+Carter+and+Christian+Kiefer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
