The Weather Station is a Canadian folk music project of Tamara Lindeman, formed in 2006.

It is said that the Weather Station was born in a closet. One day, Tamara Lindeman sat down to make music she had never heard.  Using her banjo, her voice, a borrowed microphone, and a selection of percussive household items, Tamara taught herself to write, then to record.  Slowly she cut together her musical exploration of loss and everything that comes along with it.

The urgings of friends led to the assembly of a five piece band.  With banjo, mandolin, violin, and other wooden wonders, they re-interpreted her music, both broadening it and strengthening it as they brought it out into the world of live performance.

This is music about landscapes, both broad and cramped; the running away and the running to; high winds and crushing distance; bracken and tundra and bush. This is music for the east coast, for urban confusion and rural absolutes.  It began as music about sadness, but it has always been propelled by fierce determination.

This is music that Tamara Lindeman can no longer contain. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Weather+Station">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
