Skiller was founded in Stockholm in 2002. The band consists of five members, all part of the original lineup.
The first few years Skiller struggled in the studio like any other aspiring act before them, but in 2004 they finally released their first record Yours to Blame, with first single Roadkill also being released on the Sweden Rock Magazine CD 9. Yours to Blame opened the door for Skiller into Europe and two shows where played in Madrid autumn 2005, while second single Still Life aired frequently on Spanish national radio at the time. Skiller also teamed up with Bilsport Magazine and had several songs from Yours to Blame featured on the Bilsport Action Events 2004-DVD.
It was with the release of album Soulless Generation in 2006 that Skiller caught the ears of metalheads all over the world. The record received great reviews and Skiller went on to play over 20 shows around the country, sharing stage with such acts as Sonic Syndicate, Blowsight, Slowlife and Mustasch.
