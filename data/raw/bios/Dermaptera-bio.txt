The sounds of Dermaptera can be described as avant garde electronica chill-out with mainly ambient elements, but also with the occasional jazz, acoustic, or other sound experiments. Liquid voice and synthesizer blend with amazing electronic bass sounds. Epic length ambient songs live side by side with shorter tunes.
