Ohol Yeg is a one-man black metal band from Ankara, Turkey. The only member is Sazakan on all the instruments. Whole music and visual production belong to Sazakan as well. The project has been established in 2014 and still active. The theme of the songs consists of nihilism, nature, hatred, misanthropy, ancient Turkic roots. 

Etymology: Ohol is the god of brutality and Yeg is the devil himself in two different old Turkic mythologies. They are the ones who will collaborate and bring doom upon the filthy civilization and the modernized world, in the band's own story. Also, Sazakan is the ancient Turkic dragon who brings thunder and rain when it flies.
