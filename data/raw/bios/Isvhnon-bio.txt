With interest towards obscurity and loathing ISVHNON slowly surfaced from the dismal Western Visayas Region (Iloilo City, Philippines) in 2004. One man carnage of unparalleled bestial attack and intense blasphemy, alone he exemplifies total abhorrence and disgust towards orthodox means and religious piety, he stands true to his belief and passion of hatred and total chaos. ISVHNON breeds and create antagonistic battle hymns with grim and droning raw sound with an iniquitous lyrical theme thus commence a sanctified decadence over Christendom and worthless Mankind, leading a triumphant march towards Ilonggo Metal Dominance and Supremacy.
