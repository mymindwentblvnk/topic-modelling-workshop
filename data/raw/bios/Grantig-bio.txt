„GRANTIG are metal!" 
No core, no death, no black, no emo, no knick, no knack. Simply straightforward, loud, hard, merciless metal. 
Their sound is pure and earthy, raw and rough, at an alarmingly high standard. The songs are compact and ready to rumble. Killer riffs and monster drums seem to come easily, lending to the venerable old metal genre an elegance that few German bands seem capable of. The four Grantig musicians have specialised not only in playing tight and working the fretboard with amazing speed – their more quiet moments also work easily and without embarrassment. Free of schmaltz and pathos, the tracks bring to mind the Mississippi Delta, whiskey, and the deep, dark swamp of life. 
This is due on the one hand to Jonathan Schmid's exceptional voice, and on the other to the blues-soaked groove that permanently drives the 12 songs on. There's not only an accelerator pedal and phat riffs to be discovered, but much more – if you dare to venture deeper into the swamp.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grantig">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
