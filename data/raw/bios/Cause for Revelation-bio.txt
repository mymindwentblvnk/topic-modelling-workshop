An unyielding ferocious assault of metal and hardcore fury, Cause For Revelation trek onward playing a vicious hardcore-fueled blend of American heavy metal. Constantly blurring the lines of heavy music, Cause For Revelation incorporate many styles from groove to thrash, uptempo to beatdown. All of these elements combined, have earned the band a reputation of being "straight forward", "technical", and "tight".

Cause For Revelation formed in Milwaukee, WI in 2003, with a focus on combining the elements of a death metal assault and a vicious hardcore attack. Featuring past and present members of several prominent midwest acts, the band's current line-up is as powerful and destructive as ever, featuring Tim Payne (vocals), Kevin Forsythe (guitar), Ryan Baxter (bass), and Jim Garcia (drums).

The title of Cause For Revelation's 2010 full-length release "Resurrecting The Hostility" says it all, truly pushing and displaying the band's true potential. A violent demonstration of their musical craft, backed by equally devastating vocals, matching every ounce of its intensity and pushing the band to the next level. The album was recorded in 2010 by engineer Chris Wisco, at Belle City Sound (Nonpoint, Lazarus AD, Novembers Doom), and mastered in Florida at Safehouse Productions by the legendary James Murphy (Obituary, Death, Testament). Upon review "Resurrecting The Hostility" has been described as "90's hardcore meets 90's death metal" and a "destructively violent album, displaying raw energy".
