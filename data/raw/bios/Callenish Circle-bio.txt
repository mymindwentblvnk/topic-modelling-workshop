Callenish Circle was a melodic death metal band from the Netherlands. 

Callenish Circle was formed in 1992 by vocalist Patrick Savelkoul and guitar player Jos Evers. Some line-up changes followed but it wasn't until early 1994 when the first serious line-up was gathered. From that 1994 line-up Ronny Tyssen (guitars), Gavin Harte (drums) and Patrick Savelkoul (vocals) formed the core of the band.

They broke up in 2007 due to ongoing problems with their label and distributors.
