VAINGLORY is a band that features intense riffs, masterful guitar, virtuoso drumming, heavy bass, powerful vocals and thought provoking lyrics.

Based around Corbin King, this band has all the ingredients in place to be a major force on the metal market for years to come. Along with guitarist/songwriter Corbin King the band includes vocal sensation Kate French, of Chastain fame. Kate's ability to mix power, conviction, emotion, and true heavy metal singing is very uncommon in today's "metal" vocalists. Kate is veteran to heavy metal and has not only pushed beyond the normal bounds of female vocalists, but has delivered her best recorded performance to date on this CD.
