Sculpture is a name of at least two bands: 

[[b]1] A audiovisual performance duo from London - electronic music producer, Dan Hayhurst, and animator, Reuben Sutherland. Sutherland ‘DJs’ with home-made zoetropic discs, intricate concentric rings of illustrated frames, projecting fragments of looping images at 33, 45 and 78 rpm - pre-Edisonian imaging technology combined with a digital video camera.

Hayhurst deploys prepared audio material (found tapes, lo-fi electronics, computer programming, and analogue noise) across 1⁄4” tape loops, hardware sampler, cassette walkman and CDJ deck.
The process is important. a kind of unstable modular collage. style. rhythm. spontaneity. input, output, and a bit in the middle called 'music' (audible and visible) which requires the computer to be switched off.
The music: A strange amalgam of found sounds (corresponding perfectly with the found imagery), Plunderphonics, ancient electronic music recalling the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, twisted rhythms (imagine Felix Kubin playing dubstep), all mixed hands-on on the spot.

[[b]2] A German gothic metal band founded by guitarist Lotte shortly after he left Crematory in 1998. They released one album in 1999 but since then not much has been heard from them. In late May 1999 the bass player Hans Mappes suffered a serious motorcycle accident. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sculpture">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
