There are/were multiple bands called Lost Generation:

1) Lost Generation was a 1970s soul/funk combo based in Chicago. 

2)  Lost Generation was a 1980s punk band formed by singer/songwriter Joe Dias. The original line-up included fellow Connecticut musicians Glenn Sanders on drums, BADBOB Therrien on guitar and Sach on bass. The bands first release, 1982’s Never Work” featured three original tunes and a 33 second version of “Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds” simply titled “L.S.D.” Word of the band spread quickly beyond the small Connecticut scene as critics proclaimed the title track a new punk anthem. By the end of the year New York’s leading alternative paper, The Village Voice, listed “Never Work” as one of the top five singles of the year. Lost Generation’s second release also received national attention due to a special guest appearance by HR of the Bad Brains. “Military Heroes” was issued on cassette only in 1983 and was co-produced by HR as well. The band soon followed up the next year with their first LP, “Return From Incas”, which featured new bassist Chuck Reynolds. The “Victim” LP, with yet another new bassist Bryant Kane, was released in 1985. The band intended to follow up this release with the “Positive Rituals” LP in 1986. The project was scrapped however when BADBOB left to pursue a solo career.
Lost Generation finally recorded again in 1988 with new guitarist Ginger Boe Hammond. They promoted the new “Censored” LP with an extensive U.S. tour. The band toured again in 1989 with new drummer Jon Gendron. Opening for the U.K. Subs they traveled the U.S. and Canada. The bands latest release “Midnight Meat Train” appeared in 1990. This recording generated a huge controversy due to the graphic cover artwork. Their last album “Altered Visions” was recorded in 1991 but has never been released.
Despite several personnel changes, Lost Generation was a fixture on the East Coast music scene for over 10 years. During the 80’s they opened for many touring acts including Circle Jerks, The Damned, Dead Kennedys, X, Public Image and more. The band's record label, Incas Records also released and distributed records by several dozen bands in addition to their own material.
