Genre(s) Death/Doom Metal       Sweden (Helsingborg) 1991 

Gardens Of Obscurity was formed in 1991 with the intention to play grindcore under the moniker Slavestate. After a couple of rehearsals they changed their mind and started playing death metal with semi-occult lyrics with a new band name Asmodeus. When they released their first demo tape they changed their name again into Gardens Of Obscurity and started playing slow death / doom metal. At the time of a second demo they played more technical death metal. Since there were no labels showing any interest they laid the band to rest in 1994 and focused on the side project The Darksend.
