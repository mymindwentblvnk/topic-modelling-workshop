San Cisco are from Fremantle in sunny Western Australia. On the weekends they love to go skateboarding, play Nintendo 64 and make a bit of indie pop on the side. Scarlett bangs the drums, Jennifer plays the electric bass, Jordi & Josh are the guys that play the guitars, write the songs and sing them.

San Cisco have spent the last year graduating high school, performing at some festivals and playing round town pretty much every weekend. They have also produced their first EP called Golden Revolver, which is set for release early 2011. Confident with stage presence & strong with vocals, San Cisco's upbeat summer pop continues to impress.

Jordi says: "San Cisco is a place situated between reality & a dream state. It is kind of like a huge cauldron we put all our creative input into, mix it together to make a super explosion of fantastic, wild creations. This is San Cisco."
