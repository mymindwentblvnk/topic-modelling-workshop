Alone In The Silence was formed in 2005 when Ondra Naplava came up with the idea of forming a modern melodic metal band. Libor Trncak and Pavel Nabity (at rock/metal band Eleniel) were eager to try something new so they agreed to give it a try. Now, the trouble was to find a singer. Eventually, they talked into Michal Hladik.

AITS was complete with the line-up: guitarist Ondra Naplava, drummer Libor Trncak, bass guitarist Pavel Nabity and singer Michal Hladik.

In 2007 AITS recorded their first promo Destination at the Gate of Sorrow studios. This year they are playing abroad for their first time.

In 2008 is coming to band new guitarist Adam Otrusina. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alone+in+the+silence">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
