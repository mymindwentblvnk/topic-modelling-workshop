Late 2008 saw the birth of a new and exciting tech-metal/hardcore band Immortal Threat. With a sound that lives up to their name, Immortal Threat has fast earned a reputation for an eye opening live show and fine musicianship. They have developed a solid fan base after headlining successful interstate and regional tours throughout 2009.

Immortal Threat has strived to broaden their musical range to sculpt a unique sound that is difficult to categorise. Individually each member displays scintillating musical talent; united they are a force to be reckoned with. Combining fast and furious blast beats, crazy time signatures and vicious breakdowns with melodic progressions, Immortal Threat pride themselves on delivering a powerful and high energy live performance.

Immortal Threat captured their evolving sound when they went into Adelaide's acclaimed Against The Grain Studio, working with Andy Kite to record their 1st major release. Mastered in Sweden's Panic Room Studio by Tomas "Plec" Johansson (Miseration, Scar Symmerty & Groove Armada), then released through This Sick Productions & Savvy Muzik entitled “A.D.”.
