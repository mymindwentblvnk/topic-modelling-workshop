Oakland-born, Atlanta-based singer/rapper Robert Davis first recorded as Rolls Royce Rizzy, pinged the radar of a certain luxury automobile manufacturer, and subsequently altered his name to Royce Rizzy. Davis settled on 24hrs following a brief affiliation with Jermaine Dupri's So So Def label. A more R&B-oriented outlet for Davis -- with pitch-altered, bottom-heavy slow jams the m.o., placing him somewhere between the-Dream and frequent collaborator Ty Dolla $ign -- 24hrs debuted in 2016 with multiple bundles of SoundCloud uploads and Open, an EP released commercially through Private Club. The eight-track follow-up Night Shift followed in 2017, at which point Davis had also racked up outside collaborations with the likes of MadeinTYO (his brother), Ty, G-Eazy, and Blackbear. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/24hrs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
