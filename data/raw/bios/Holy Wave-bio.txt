Holy Wave are a psych outfit from El Paso, TX, who, in the words of Austin Psych Fest curators, ¨carefully combine fluid forms of sacred surf sounds, droning riffs and group vocals that haunt and harmonize in equal measure.¨ The debut album, ´Knife Hits´ was released in 2011, and was quickly followed up by an EP, titled ´The Evil Has Landed´ the following year. The start of 2014 saw the band release their second album, ´Relax´, which will be supported by a Spring European tour.
