SQUIRTOPHOBIC was founded in March 2008 and plays Groovy Porn with brutal Death Metal influences. After a short time the first 10-track CD "UNDERGRIND" was released and shattered the underground like a bomb.


Furthermore the band performed in the course of several big festivals such as BRINGERS OF DEATH, FOR THOSE ABOUT TO GRIND and SIC & GSCHISSN FEST. Between August and December 2008 the band is going to perform about 20 festival- and clubshows to promote the new record “UNDERGRIND”. Moreover some plans for 2009 are already set.
