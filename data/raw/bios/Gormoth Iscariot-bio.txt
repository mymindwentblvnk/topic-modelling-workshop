The project "Gormoth Iscariot" was founded in September 2004 in the city of Berkovitza. After a month the first 5 songs were ready and included in the self-released demo "In The Shadows Of The Black Ages". The demo was recorded in home conditions, but the sound was good. The frosty guitar riffs, agressive programmed drums and malicious vocals, which Gormoth Iscariot unleashes, form the current style of the project. For the future Gormoth is thinking of enriching the sound with keyboards.
