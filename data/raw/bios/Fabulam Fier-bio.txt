Fabulam Fier was founded in the summer of 2006 in Tampere, Finland. The band's sound is a unique mix of elements from various styles. It combines Death Metal, stunning melodies, interesting harmonies and traditional Heavy Metal to name a few. The grinding riffs, beautiful bass lines and clockwork performance of the drummer lay a solid foundation for the singer's strong, brutal voice to build on. The band members have over ten years of experience playing in various line-ups.
