A grindcore, mincecore band from Redwood City, California, which existed from 1988 to 1993 and then reformed in 1998 to record an album to honor former bass player Dan "Zodiac Iller" Hogan who had recently passed.  Plutocracy's musical style can be summarized in one word: Dankcore.  A mix of grindcore, distortion, movie samples, gangsta rap, and multiple screaming voices with references to killing cops, smoking weed, and inside jokes regarding their "crew", known to many as the "Doomryderz". 

The group consisted of Stinkweed (guitar, vocals), Kalmex (guitar, vocals), Frank Ripple (bass), Battle Axe Max [Max Ward] (drums), Dan Hogan (bass, vocals), Billy (bass), Chris V (bass), Jessie (vocals), & Mike (bass).  They put out a demo (Progress), several split 7" records (With 976, Aproctous, Discordance Axis and Phobia) and some EPs  (Snitch, Freedom Denied) , which were all later released on the Dankstahz CD in 1992. In 2000 came the final Plutocracy album, Sniping Pigz.  Ten years later, they released the EP Off the Pigs.  They disbanded in 2012.
