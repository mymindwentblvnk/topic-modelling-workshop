For the official release of Rumors of a Secret War (on Tragic Hero Records), Ghost called upon thier friends in ...an ellipsis to compose three short noise interludes to coincide with the rest of the material they had recorded.

As of April 2008, Ghost of a Fallen Age has been disbanded, with much confusion and betrayal.

Darren Via is now in a new band called Beyond The Throne. Check them out! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ghost+Of+A+Fallen+Age">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
