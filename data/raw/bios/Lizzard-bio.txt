Lizzard is Katy Elwell on drums, Mathieu Ricou on guitar & vocals, and William Knox on bass.
The trio started out in early 2006 and recorded their first demo in the same year.
They went on to perform shows around France throughout 2007 and built up a solid fan base.

The band's first EP Venus was produced by Rhys Fulber (Paradise Lost, Fear Factory, Front Line Assembly…). Rhys loved Lizzard’s music, finding the band to have “a marvelous polyrythmic sound”.
The EP came out in 2008, getting great reviews, often rating Lizzard in the same league as bands such as King Crimson, Tool, Isis, Sigur Ros…

In 2009, they followed on with a national tour, opening for some of the biggest french rock headliners such as Gojira, Punish Yourself, Freedom for King-Kong, Enhancer, Loudblast…
Despite being based in France, Lizzard, to their surprise, was getting more and more attention from across the Atlantic.
After opening a show for the legendary rock drummer Carmine Appice (Cactus, Vanilla Fudge, Jeff Beck, Rod Stewart, Pink Floyd, Ozzy Osbourne…) the “legend” fell for the band declaring: “For me one of the coolest bands I've heard in ages…Lizzard does rock!!”

In 2011, the band traveled to Los Angeles to record their first full-length album with Rhys Fulber: Out of Reach.
