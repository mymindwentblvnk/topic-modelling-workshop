Porvoo, Finland (2010 - Present)

Antagonist Zero is a five-piece metal band from Porvoo, Finland, formed in 2010. Despite the band’s young age, the members have many years of experience playing in different bands, such as Adastra, Cavus, Coprolith and Lost In Tears. 
The band describes their music as “catatonic metal”, which includes elements from different types of metal genres, namely doom as well as death/black and post metal. 
Their debut release Nighttime Harmony came out in early 2012. This three song EP is only a taste of the band’s material, of which there is more than enough for a whole album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Antagonist+Zero">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
