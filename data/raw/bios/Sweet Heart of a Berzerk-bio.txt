Sweet Heart of a Berzerk is the solo project of Christian Schmidt, who played as guitarist since '82 in various German Heavy Metal and Crossover bands. 

Since '94 he worked on several music projects in his own music studio. End of the '90's he discovered his passion to Gothic and Melodic Death Metal. This can be find again in the music of Sweet Heart of a Berzerk with its recognizable melodies and straightness, supported by unobtrusiv synthesizer sounds.

Two albums are released so far: "Why?" (2005) and "Wings of Eternity" (2007). A third album is already in progress and should be released beginning 2010.
