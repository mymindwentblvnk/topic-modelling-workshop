Café del Mar is a bar located in San Antonio, Ibiza, just to the west of the West End. It is a popular summer tourist destination, noted for its view of the local sunset. Café del Mar is the original Ibizan "sunset bar", opened by Ramón Guiral, Carlos Andrea, and José Les in 1978.

The Café del Mar releases compilation albums with tracks selected by the bar's own DJs. The music selection is intended to induce the mood that is experienced watching a sunset. The tracks are described as ambient, easy listening music. The bar originally sold their own tapes of the music but a series of Café del Mar CDs have been sold. As of 2008, there are 15 volumes, numerous side compilations, plus 2 albums commemorating the 20th and 25th Anniversary. A total of about 9 million albums have been sold worldwide.

At the beginning of the eighties, cassette collections began to be sold of the music heard there. In 1994, the English company React published the first “Café del Mar” CD, which included work by artists of world renown like Underworld, A Man Called Adam, Stelle, Tabula Rasa, etc... The success of this collection meant that in the summers of 1995 and 1996 “Café del Mar – Volume Dos” and “Café del Mar – Volume Tres” were published. 

This success led to the executives of Polygram UK (Universal Music) to decide in 1997 and 1998 to publish “Café del Mar – Volume Cuatro” and “Café del Mar – Volume Cinco”, which included artists of recognised world standing
The summer of 1998 saw the inauguration of the first Café del Mar shop, selling sportswear (T-shirts, polos, sweatshirts, merchandising, etc…) all with the Café del Mar logo.
In 1998, the record company CAFÉ DEL MAR MUSIC was set up, in Sant Antoni de Portmany (Eivissa), recovering the rights of recording exploitation of the CAFÉ DEL MAR name. CAFÉ DEL MAR MUSIC’s first record launch was “Café del Mar – Aria” in Spring 1999.

CAFÉ DEL MAR MUSIC reached an agreement with Universal Music to exploit the CAFÉ DEL MAR name worldwide except in Spain, solely and exclusively for the recorded exploitation of:

“Café del Mar – Volume Seis” (1999)
“Café del Mar – Volume Siete” (2000)
“Café del Mar –  Volume Ocho” (2001)
“Café del Mar – The Best Of” (2003)

In autumn 1999, Bruno Lepretre selected, compiled and mixed “Café del Mar – Chill House”, a double CD reflecting the environment of the Ibiza night in Café del Mar.

Following the spectacular success of “Café del Mar – Aria” with the critics and in terms of sales, in December 1999 “Café del Mar – Aria 2 New Horizon” appeared, created, arranged and directed by Paul Schwartz.

To bring the music of Café del Mar to new generations, in Spring 2000 an album was compiled called “Café del Mar – Dreams”, which included the most famous works in Café de MarVols. 1, 2 and 3. 

In June 2000, the company Ibiza Music & Clothes was established, to distribute Café del Mar’s CDs and apparel worldwide.
With the advent of the new millennium, in July 2000 Café del Mar celebrated its twentieth anniversary with a spectacular festa on the seashore, attended by more than 5000. Several of the artists on the discs performed live, e.g. “Afterlife”, “A Man Call Adam”, “Mandalay”, “Instrumental Classic”, plus a set of DJs with Bruno Lepretre, Lenny Ibizarre, Levitation, etc.
This mass festa, with actuations, a set of DJs and performance, led to the recording of a TV special, broadcast on Channel 4.

In August 2000, “Café del Mar – 20th Anniversary” was published, a commemorative double CD. The first, compiled by Bruno (Resident DJ), contains the new artists and music of this millennium. The second, compiled by Ramón Guiral, is a tribute to Café del Mar’s 20 years, and includes emblematic works connected with its renowned sunset. There is also an interactive track where the most beautiful images of the Café and its sunset can be enjoyed.

At the end of the year, a company specialised in website design began work on that for www.cafedelmarmusic.com which was placed on the web at the beginning of 2001 in three languages (Spanish, English and German). The average successful entries in the last year were 45 million.
