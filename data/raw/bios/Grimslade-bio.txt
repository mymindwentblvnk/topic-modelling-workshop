Grimslade was founded in St. Petersburg, Russia, in the year of 2015. It started as a folk metal band, and chose scary fairy tales as the primary theme for their lyrics. Those include the well-known stories by Ch. Perrault, H. C. Andersen, a crossover of A. S. Pushkin and H. P. Lovecraft, and a comical tolkienesque cover of a techno rave band Car-Man.
The band's crew remained more or less constant with the exception of the its ex-drummer, Nikita Efremov.
After much toil, Grimslade released their first EP entitled "Wherever the tales go..." in April 2016, followed by a single, "Of Fish and Fisher", in June 2016.

The current band members are:

Max Borin — vocals, bass
Eugene Trukhachev — guitar
Alexey Korolev — guitar, back vocals
Alexey Grigoryev — drums
Vladimir Ziniakov — lyrics
