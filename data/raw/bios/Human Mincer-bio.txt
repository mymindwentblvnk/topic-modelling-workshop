HUMAN MINCER were formed in 1996 by a group of friends with the purpose of making a Death Metal band. At first, they began making poor Thrash/Death and soon after, the lead guitarist and the vocalist left the band.
After two years of rehearsing without a vocalist, they tried with a guy called Carlos that fit very well with the style of the band.

In 1999 HUMAN MINCER recorded a self-produced demo CD called "Grotesque Visceral Extraction" with Gore/Satanic lyrics influenced by American bands. It sold very well in the Spanish Underground scene.
In 2001 Carlos had to leave the band due to personal problems, and Miguel (guitars) replaced him in the vocal duties.

In September 2001 HUMAN MINCER recorded a new promo CD called "Putrefying Your Agony" released by the band themselves, with the help of QABALAH PRODUCTIONS. It includes three songs in a more intense, brutal and technical way.

Soon after the recording, in August, a new vocalist called Edu (ex-VIRULENCE-rip) joined the band, but didn't last for too long because he didn't fit the band's style.

The band has played many concerts with bands like WORMED (Madrid), AVULSED (Madrid), DISGORGE (USA), ANIMAS (CÃ³rdoba), INFECTED FLESH (Barcelona), LIGHTNING (Sevilla) and other brutal bands, including their appearance at the 4th Steel warrior's Rebellion Festival in Barroselas (Portugal) in April '01.

In April '02, their former vocalist Carlos returned to the band and they started to work hard on the final compositions for their debut album "Embryonized" that was later recorded in August of the same year, being released through XTREEM MUSIC in October 2002.

The band toured around some Spanish cities introducing their first job with AVULSED. They played too in the first edition of the "TraumaFest" in Madrid where they played with bands like AGATHOCLES, HELLNATION, HAEMORRHAGE, MACHETAZO... and in some fest more like "Brutal as Hell Fest" with IMPERIOUS MALEVOLENCE, SCENT OF DEATH & CHAMBER OF SHRED.

In the begining of 2003 they started the composition of the new songs for the second full length. The date for this edition had to be delayed due to personal problems of Miguel (guitarrist). Finally, in September 2004, eight songs were made and they recorded them at the V.R.S. studios, the same place they recorded their first CD. The title of the album is "Devoured Flesh" and it was released through XTREEM MUSIC in January 2005.

In summer of 2006 Antonio (bass) and Carlos (vocals) leave the band for personal problems, and Phlegeton (vocals from Wormed) and Guillemoth (bass from Wormed) join forces with Human Mincer. In October they appeared in Ludwigshafen Deathfest (Germany) with bands like INVERACITY, MUCOPUS, INGURGITATING OBLIVION, GOREINHALED and more brutal bands. Actually they are composing new songs for their third cd, it will be released in 2007 with Unmatched Brutality records
