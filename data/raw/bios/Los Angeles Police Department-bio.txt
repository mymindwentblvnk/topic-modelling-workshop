Los Angeles Police Department is the solo vehicle of bedroom pop singer, songwriter, and multi-ins- trumentalist Ryan Pollie. A native of Philadelphia, Pollie relocated to Los Angeles where he recorded his self-titled debut under the L.A.P.D. banner in 2014. An intimate collection of gently ornate pop with a lo-fi patina, the self-released album was a hit was critics and netted Pollie a deal with the Anti- label which released his slightly more polished (and also self-titled) follow-up album in April 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Los+Angeles+Police+Department">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
