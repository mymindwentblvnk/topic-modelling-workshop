"Formed in early 2008, as a project of the Malgatum frontman. BWS' goal is to conqurer and make love with every nation possible on Earth (and more)! Hide your women! In 2008, I would like to add the complete discography for this project. After the first demo (Bestial Warsex...now!) comes IWFY (I Will Fuck You) and the finishing WAAP (War against Asexual Pacifists). Two songs on each of 'em." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bestial+WarSex">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
