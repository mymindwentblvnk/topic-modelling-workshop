Alberto Evaristo Ginastera (April 11, 1916 – June 25, 1983) was an Argentinian composer of classical music. He is considered one of the most important Latin American classical composers.

Ginastera was born in Buenos Aires to a Catalan father and an Italian mother. He preferred to pronounce his surname in its Catalan pronunciation, with a soft "G" (i.e., JEE'-nah-STEH-rah rather than the Castilian Spanish KHEE'-nah-STEH-rah).

He studied at the conservatory in Buenos Aires, graduating in 1938. After a visit to the United States of America in 1945–47, where he studied with Aaron Copland at Tanglewood, he returned to Buenos Aires and co-founded the League of Composers. He held a number of teaching posts. He moved back to the USA in 1968 and from 1970 lived in Europe. He died in Geneva. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alberto+Ginastera">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
