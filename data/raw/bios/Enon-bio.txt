Enon was an indie rock band, founded in Philadelphia in 1998 by John Schmersal, Rick Lee and Steve Calhoon. After Brainiac's disbandment, guitarist Schmersal teamed up with ex-Skeleton Key members Lee and Calhoon to form Enon.

Following the release of their first album "Believo!" in 2000, Calhoon left the band, and was replaced by Toko Yasuda on vocals and bass, and Matt Schulz on drums; with this line up, Enon released "High Society" in 2002.

Lee left the band, and Enon went on to release "Hocus Pocus" in 2003, and a collection of rare material entitled "Lost Marbles and Exploded Evidence" was released in 2005.

Enon performed on a February 2010 episode of Yo Gabba Gabba! entitled "Space".
In a May 2011 interview, after touring with Caribou for a good portion of 2010 and 2011, Schmersal confirmed the band "is pretty much over" with no plans to follow up on Grass Geysers...Carbon Clouds.

In 2011 and 2012, Toko Yasuda toured as a member of St. Vincent playing synth. She also released the album Parthenon under the name Plvs Vltra. Parthenon is her first solo album which features collaborations with Danny Ray Thompson of the Sun Ra Arkestra, Scott Allen of Thunderbirds Are Now!, Thomas Keville of Man Man, and John Schmersal, also of Enon, who produced the album.
