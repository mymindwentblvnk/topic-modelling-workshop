There are multiple artists named Urna:

1) Urna is a doom metal band from Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy, formed in 2003 by MZ (guitars, bass, programming) and RM (vocals). They are known for mixing black metal with funeral doom metal.

2) Urna, best known by her full name Urna Chahar-Tugchi, is a Mongolian singer.

3) Urna is a ritual ambient project from Naples, Italy, formed by Gianluca Martucci (also in Sagenhaft and Il Prato dei Desideri). Urna's music offers various obscure sound layers, moaning and whispering voices, chants and incantations, echoing through the tenebrous realms of unconsciousness. Urna's releases have been published on several labels, including the well-known Marco Corbelli's noise label Slaughter Productions. His album "Missadquumdahle" has been described as: "bells, singing bowls, deviant shrieks & moanings, raped classical melodies & organ masses wrap you into a rotting cerement of pestilential danse macabre".
