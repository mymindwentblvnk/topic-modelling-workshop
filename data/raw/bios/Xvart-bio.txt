XVART's roots can be traced back to 2008 when Ian Berling wanted to start a doom/death metal band but at the time, he couldn't find any members thus the idea was put to rest for awhile. That was until May 2009, when Ian approached his ANAL COMA bandmate Josh and John S. (of DEMONIACAL POSSESSION and BITCH KILLER) with the idea of starting a fantasy based Doom/Death Metal band. The two accepted the offer and XVART officially began. The original line up of XVART was complete with Josh on vocals, John on guitar/bass, and Ian on drums. The band self-released a demo simply referred to as "Demo 2009" (later re-released as "The Skeleton Knight" on Thorn Laceration Records) on July 1st, 2009. The demo was met with good response. Not long after, Josh left the band (but on good terms). Now, with John handling the vocals, the band has finished their debut album entitled "Decrepit Beast." They hope to find a label to release this album by the end of 2009.
