1) Hardcore band from Bandung, indonesian It was 1995, the year when four kids decided to form a band. They decided to play a hardcore music influence by Madball, Biohazzard, Sick Of It All, etc. After 11 years hit the street with the well distorted guitar, slappin' low end, shouts and ear bleeding beats finally Authority decided to change the way hardcore music that used to play.

2) harsh noise project from Dayton, Ohio (USA). http://oktomedia.bandcamp.com/

3) There is obviously a number of bands with the name Authority. The most important one though, is a punk/hardcore band from Milanowek near Warsaw, Poland. It consisted of Bogdan, Marcin and Michal. Towards the end of their career a fourth member was introduced. The band broke up in early 2007 due to artistic differences. Bogdan went on to pursue a solo career as an all-time rock star. They released no albums but many bootlegs circled the scene and a few demos leaked out. They were even once on MTV.

Controversy: On MTV Michal said he is often picked on by the polish thugs for looking like an emo-fag. Their guest appearance at Bogdan's school show resulted in them only being able to play about 4 songs while being contracted for 10. This was due to the power cut in the city and later by a fucked-up bitch, who obviously didn't enjoy their hardcore sound (?) cut off their power.
After this incident the atmosphere in the band was never the same.

Rumour has it that they might be up for a little reunion sometime in the summer.
