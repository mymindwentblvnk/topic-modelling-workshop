Born in Louisville, KY sometime around 1997, Kilowatthours adapted to a constant change in environment by becoming increasingly grandiose and triumphant. With its line-up evolving nearly a half-dozen times, they've since settled into their new position as one of New York City's loudest pop bands, boasting as many as three guitars wailing over keyboards, bass and drums. As they grew in size, they've also become increasingly self-sufficient, booking their own tours and producing their own recordings and just generally working harder than ever.

After a final line up change, and with their music evolving from its atmospheric roots towards a more driving noise-pop sound, the band made a fresh start by rechristening themselves Up The Empire. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kilowatthours">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
