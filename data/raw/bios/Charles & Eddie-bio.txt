Charles and Eddie were an American vocal duo made up of Charles Pettigrew and Eddie Chacon. The two originally met on a New York City subway train. Chacon was holding a copy of Marvin Gaye's "Trouble Man," and so the two struck up a conversation and later started performing together. Chacon had grown up in Oakland, California, where he was in a soul band, and later moved to Miami, Florida, where his recording career continued on projects with the Dust Brothers and Daddy-O. Pettigrew, meanwhile, was raised in Philadelphia, and went on to study jazz vocals at the Berklee College Of Music in Boston, while also singing with the pop band Down Avenue.

Charles and Eddie enjoyed a worldwide hit in 1992 with "Would I Lie To You?"

Their song "I Would Stop The World" was featured in the 1993 film Super Mario Bros. based on the popular series of video games.

After the break up of Charles and Eddie in 1996, Eddie continued as a writer/producer selling 6 million cd's and writing another eight number one hits in various territories around the globe. Eddie is currently in another duo (boy/girl this time). They are called THE POLYAMOROUS AFFAIR. There debut cd is slated for release May 2008.

Charles Pettigrew died of cancer on April 7, 2001 at age 37.
