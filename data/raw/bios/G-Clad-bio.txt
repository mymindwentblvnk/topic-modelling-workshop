Formed by Ash Lemmerf in 2004, G-Clad was originally just a one-man band. A handful of unreleased demos were recorded. After he joined Metallisk Esel Hives, the band went on hold indefinably. Some dis-liked M.E.H. material was the basis of the re-formation in mid-2006. Only Ash and G.C. were in favor of the material, but the remaining band members weren't. While in search for a 2nd guitarist, Ash's brother linked them with keyboardist Kriin, who also took over G.C.s role as bass, leaving him only with vocal duties. Drummer Wroatakilamoy was then brought in, giving a full lineup. A split with M.E.H. was then recorded, which caused controversy through-out the American media. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/G-Clad">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
