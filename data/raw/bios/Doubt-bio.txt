There are also three known bands with the name of Doubt:

1. Pop-Punk band from Kent, England

Influenced by The Story So Far, Mallory Knox and Chunk! No, Captain Chunk!, Doubt bring together the genres of alternative rock and pop punk to fill your ears with sweet catchy melodies and big sing alongs. Their live shows are more than energetic, and they get crowds of 70+ jumping like crazy.
