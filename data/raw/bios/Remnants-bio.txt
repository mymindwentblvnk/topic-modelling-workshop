2) Remnants are a four piece blues-based band from the Midlands. The three original members of the band, Paul Gooderham, Steve Jack and Paul Haines, were all in the successful blues group Gasoline which disbanded in the late 1980s. For the next 20 years the group went their separate ways to pursue their individual musical directions. Following a successful reunion it was decided that they should reform under a new name but with their original musical roots at the forefront.

The line-up of the band later changed with bass guitarist Paul Haines moving on to be replaced by Wolverhampton bassist Jim Cooper. Paul and Steve still remain the driving force behind the band and have recently enlisted another great local musician, Carl Sykes, to provide the group with the additional element of percussion.

Remnants play a rich mix of original music dominated by electro-acoustic guitars, harmonica and vocal harmonies. Their material has its roots in a variety of styles with a strong emphasis on rhythm and blues. Their set also includes carefully chosen standards rearranged to suit the group's style.

5) Remnants is the creative team comprised of Abhi Nayar and Chad Janotta, both from Chicago, Illinois.

To date, they have released two EPs, two singles, and reportedly have many more releases in the works, set for release this year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Remnants">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
