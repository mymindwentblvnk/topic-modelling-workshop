Breaking Violet was a mid 90’s hard rock band from Montreal, Quebec comprised of Stéphane Fania (from Boize and Emissary) on vocals and bass, Robert Kourie (from Boize and Emissary) on guitar and Alain on drums. The material was originally worked on through out 1995, under the name Emissary. When they recorded their album, now under the name of "Breaking Violet", Stéphane “Stan” Mayrand (who later worked with Charly Buss, Didier Boutin, Marijo Bonheur, Christian Marquis, Jean-François Fortier, Ma Blonde Est Une Chanteuse, Mange l'ours mange, CQFD, Alain Simard, Le Berth Blues Band, Les Zapartistes and Slam Corrida), an old high school friend of Steph, was hired to play drums on it. The full-length, "Digging Up Old Bones" was recorded at H.Q. Studio on a 2 inch tape with a 24-track recorder, and was released on Klink Publishing. After pressing the CDs, they made a music video for the song "Greed", which featured another drummer, which aired on Much Music and MusiquePlus in 1997. To play their first show at Purple Haze bar in Montreal, they had another new drummer. Their final live show was a fund raising benefit concert for Cancer and AIDs, at which they played an acoustic version of "I Don't Want to Die", a song written about Steph's uncle dying of Cancer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Breaking+Violet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
