Clair Cassis is an atmospheric black metal project from Portland, Oregon, Unites States, formed in 2009 by Josh (aka SGL) & Angela (aka LVG) of Velvet Cacoon, and Daniel Marvin of Veinke.
They disbanded in  2010, immediately after the release of "Clair Cassis II" but reformed again in 2011 to release a new EP titled "Luxury Absolute". The music itself is classified by the band as "Luxurious black metal inspired by drugs, fine perfume and graveyards."
