Kynesis is movement, flowing of orchestral melodies with melanconic and aggressive riff. The band is born in 2002 when the original nucleus, after 2 years of cover, decides to begin the composition and execution of own songs. The sound draws the greater part of the infuence from Gothic Metal. After several changes of line-up, in September 2004 we have a stable line-up and the recording of the first demo, "Kynesis".
A new line-up with another voice brings new ideas and new songs, so a new demo, "Breath of Existence", recorded in June 2006.
Kynesis are now at work for new songs, for you.
