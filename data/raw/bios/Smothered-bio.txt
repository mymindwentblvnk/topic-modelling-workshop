Old school Death Metal blended with thrash and black metal.
It started back in early 2010 as a one man project but grew into a full band after great response form a few preview songs uploaded to Myspace. With lyrical themes spanning from the H.P Lovecraft Cthulhu mythos to serial killers and nuclear war, Smothered is ready to take over the world with their unique sound and killer riffs. Catchy death metal without any bullshit. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Smothered">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
