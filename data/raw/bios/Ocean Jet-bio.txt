Ocean Jet — a new name in modern independent music.

Ocean Jet debuted with the single «Distant» in November 2013. In less than a month the song spread through social networks with incredible speed. It took less than three weeks to get a huge amount of positive feedback and reviews, gathering more than 1,500 subscribers to the official VK community, and the number keeps growing. The band receives a lot of feedback from all over the globe.

On December 25, 2013 Ocean Jet released an EP called «Echoes», which included four tracks. In 2014 the band began preparing for live shows, which will consist of songs from the EP, and a few other songs that were written specially for their live performances.

The music style of the band can’t be assigned to any particular genre, it’s more of a mix of many. The uniqueness of each track shows in an unusual and soulful vocal, and an intriguing and balanced arrangement. Fans defined the style as indie/electronic.

The name Ocean Jet doesn’t have any specific meaning, according to the band, but instead emphasizes the atmosphere that they create with their songs. The mix of a spacious and undisturbed ocean with an uncontrollable storm.
