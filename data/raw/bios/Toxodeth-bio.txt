Toxodeth were one of the very first Mexican death metal bands. They released two demos in 1988, one self titled and one titled "Phantasms". In 1989 they released an album titled "Mysteries About Life and Death" on the cult Ameircan metal label Wild Rags Records. They released their second and final album in 1993 titled "Lo mas Morbido de la Realidad". "Phantasms" was reissued on vinyl on Utterly Somber Creations in 2006 with bonus live and other material and on CD by American Line in 2008 with more live material and additional recordings. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Toxodeth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
