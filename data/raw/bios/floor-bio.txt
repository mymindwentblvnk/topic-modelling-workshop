There are multiple Artists called Floor: 

1. Floor is a sludge-pop / doom / metal / stoner band from Miami, Florida, United States.

Floor was formed in 1992 by Steve Brooks (guitar), Anthony Vialon (bass), and Betty Monteavaro (drums). Jeff Sousa became the drummer in late 1993, and Steve and Anthony switched to just having two low-tuned guitars with no bassist. Several vinyl-only 7” EPs were released until their first break-up in 1996. 

They reformed with Henry Wilson on drums for one show in 1997 and practiced only occasionally until 2001. In 2002 they finally released their first full-length album, the self-titled ‘Floor’, before calling it quits in 2003.  Steve Brooks went on to form the band Torche. Henry Wilson went on to form the bands Dove and House Of Lightning.

Floor reformed in 2009, with Steve Brooks & Anthony Vialon agreeing to a reunion tour in 2010 to celebrate the release of "Below & Beyond", which encompassed the trio’s complete material until that point in an 8-CD/10-LP box set.

Fuelled by the exponentially-grown following during their hiatus & the enjoyment of the experience, Floor decided to record a new album, "Oblation" which was released in 2014 on Season of Mist.

2. Floor was an indie band from Germany , Ostwestfalen.
   Christopher Uhe is also singer and songwriter of Speed Niggs Sharon Stoned and Locust Fudge.
    In 2000 the band released "Free Range" on the German Label Supermodern.
