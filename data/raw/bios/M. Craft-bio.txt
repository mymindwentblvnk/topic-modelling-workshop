Martin Craft (stage name M. Craft) is an Australian singer-songwriter now living and working in Dalston, London. Martin was a former founding member of the psychedelic Canberra band Sidewinder, along with his brother Nick Craft, now known as The Zillions.

Martin first came to prominence as a solo artist with 2004's EP, I Can See It All Tonight, which garnered much critical acclaim. The EP is characterised by its unique fusing of bossanova beats, acoustic guitar, dream-pop and Martin's soft, smooth vocals. 

After being electrocuted by a faulty amp after the release of I Can See It All Tonight, Martin returned with his debut album Silver & Fire in 2006, a highly captivating and beautiful release containing several songs from his debut EP and new material. The second single from the album, radio-friendly You Are The Music, was remixed by labelmate King Creosote and Ali Love.

Martin was backed by his band The Dark Circles, with Tree Carr on backing vocals, keyboards and glockenspiel, Maya Lubinsky on backing vocals and tamborine and Paul Cook on drums. Tree Carr and Maya Lubinsky provided the sultry and sometimes melancholic vocals on the album Silver and Fire. Tree Carr can be seen in a duet with Martin in the video for You Are The Music.
