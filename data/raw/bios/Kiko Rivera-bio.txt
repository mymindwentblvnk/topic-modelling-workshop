Francisco José Rivera Pantoja, more widely known as Kiko Rivera, is an entertainer and showman relatively famous in Spain. He first became known because of the fame of his mother Isabel Pantoja and his father Francisco Rivera, a troubled bullfighter.

He's controversial enough and has been described by Spanish press as "oligophrenic", "impotent" and a "terrible student", even though he's worked in public relations and advertising.

His first contact with the music industry was in 2012, when he started DJing and released his first single "Quítate el Top". 

Also, he is a gypsy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kiko+Rivera">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
