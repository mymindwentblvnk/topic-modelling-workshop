R&B-influenced pop singer/songwriter Bazzi hit the mainstream after finding viral success with his breakthrough single, "Mine." Born Andrew Bazzi to Lebanese-American parents in Dearborn, Michigan, he was a natural performer from a young age, imitating Elvis and Ricky Martin as a child and later playing oud and acoustic guitar. At the end of high school, he moved to Los Angeles with his father to pursue a music career. In addition to building an audience online, he appeared on Fancy Cars' single "Fun" in 2016. Influenced by the likes of Justin Timberlake and Bryson Tiller, he released his solo debut, "Alone," soon after. In 2017 he issued the singles "Sober," "Beautiful," and "Got Friends?," but it wasn't until "Mine" went viral with the help of an Internet meme that his audience grew. With its smooth, breezy sound, the romantic "Mine" became a streaming hit and landed Bazzi on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/bazzi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
