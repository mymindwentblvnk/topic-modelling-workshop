Home Blitz is the recording project of Daniel DiMaggio from Princeton, New Jersey. Deep cut distorted lo-fi with some slop-rock tension and a noisy edge. His jams are hook-laden and demented. 

DiMaggio decided to include Jason Sigal on bass (Lame Drivers, Great Excape), Theresa Smith on guitar, and, for the meantime, the chillest 16 year old drummer he discovered on a skate park.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Home+Blitz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
