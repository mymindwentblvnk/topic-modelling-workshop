The Ruins of Beverast is an atmospheric black/doom metal project from Aachen (NRW), Germany that was formed in 2003 by ex-Nagelfar drummer Alexander von Meilenwald.

The musical style showcases a unique approach to creating complex, atmospheric black metal by combining traditional sounds with more unconventional elements. Lengthy compositions featuring an array of atmospheric and hypnotic components and the use of a variety of extreme vocals and choral singing define the style of this project. Recent material also features substantial influence from the funeral doom metal genre.
