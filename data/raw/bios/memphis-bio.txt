Dumont, originally from North Carolina, first met Campbell in New York City in the early 1990s. With Campbell's childhood friends Chris Seligman, James Shaw, and Adam Marvy, the pair played together in a band called Luxe.

Following the initial success of Stars, Campbell invited Dumont to visit in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Memphis was born. The duo's first effort, an EP entitled A Good Day Sailing was released on Le Grand Magistery in 2002. Over the course of the summers of 2003 and 2004, Dumont and Campbell recorded the full-length follow-up, I Dreamed We Fell Apart, released in 2004 on Paper Bag Records.
