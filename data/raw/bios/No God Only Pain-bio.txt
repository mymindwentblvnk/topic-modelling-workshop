Inspired by early black metal, especially Gorgoroth and Burzum, but interpreted in a roadhouse metal style like Motorhead meets early Death, No God Only Pain makes fast and unpredictable tunes with the type of heavy atmosphere you would expect from ex-Dawning composer Steve Cefala, who leads the band. Expect mid-length fast songs with simple riffs and unpredictable twists, but a bounding beat and bass-driven conclusion. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/No+God+Only+Pain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
