Psychaotic comes from Psy (on parapsychology this word is used for "mind" and "soul", from the greek Ïˆ  psi) and the omnipresent Chaos as the beginning and end of everything. Both concepts become part of the basic constant in the Universe:

Space, time, mass, and energy originate from Chaos, have their being in Chaos, and through the agency of the aether are moved by Chaos in the multiple forms of existence.

Psychaotic's sound becomes part of an eclectic vortex with no boundaries. Remember that music is just another sensory experience. If a dead body hits the concrete soil at the correct time maybe that should be music.
