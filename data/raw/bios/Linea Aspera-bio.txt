Linea Aspera is a minimal synth / darkwave band formed in London, UK that was originally active from 2011 to 2013. A musical duo, they were fronted by vocalist Alison Lewis (Keluar, Zanias), with Ryan Ambridge on synthesizers; Lewis wrote the lyrics while Ambridge wrote the electronics, as well as mixing and producing the recordings. The band reunited in 2019, recording a new studio album due in late 2020.

Founded in November 2011, Linea Aspera were influenced by electronic bands from the 1980s.  A reviewer reporting on a gig in January 2012 noted that their music sounded "very 80s", and that they had "sprung fully-formed" from the musical underground of East London. That month self-releasing an extended play cassette, titled Linea Aspera EP, it was described by the Burning Flame website as number one in their Top 20 EPs of 2012.

Signing to Dark Entries Records, the band's first album, Linea Aspera LP, was released on 25 September 2012. Brought out digitally and on vinyl by Dark Entries, a CD release was produced by the German company Genetic Records.  Each LP was contained in a jacket sleeve designed by Dovile Shurpo and accompanied by an insert listing their song lyrics.
