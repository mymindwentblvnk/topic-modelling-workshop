Torontoâ€™s Dhamiri has been working to provide an immense wave of fresh new sounds to the world. The rhythmic wordsmith blends an international contemporary sound, with the natural yet nocturnal vibes of the cold, dark city. Being a child of international parents, and being raised in an international territory has moulded Dhamiri's life into an apeirogon prepared for greatness.

Born in London, England due to the Gulf War in the early 90's. After the war, Dhamiri, son of English and Lebanese guardians, spent his youngest years in the sandy middle-eastern territory known as Kuwait. Becoming a teenager Dhamiri experienced an intricate society both with and against him at all angles with constant shrinking levels of opportunity. From as young as fourteen Dhamiri began writing rhymes and poems about his troubles, becoming a daily routine coping him through his entire teenage life. His adolescent years solidified the foundation of a strong leader. The visual essence of Dizzee Rascal's "Fix Up Look Sharp," and the fascinating positivity behind 2Pac's "Changes" sparked Dhamiri's motivation to follow in their footsteps. To achieve the healthier lifestyle in which he desired, Dhamiri found himself Toronto/Mississauga bound. Dhamiri used this big change as a fresh new garden to start the growth of his new life. Cherishing that today, Dhamiri shows his respects and his experiences through his music with a fresh new contemporary sound and some words of gritty truth and testimony.
