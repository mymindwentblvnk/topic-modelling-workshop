Norwegian classic rock band Humbucker originally formed in 1998. Four guys who wanted to create a band that didn`t just stand still on stageâ€¦ they wanted to create something visually exciting too, possibly one of the most energetic rock bands in Norway today.

After years of people asking when Humbucker would make a record, they finally released their debut album R.O.C.K.S on August 20th 2011. Done in a way that few bands are doing  anymore! The band decided that if they were to do a record, it should NOT be recorded in the living room and mixed in the hallway! It should be as good as possible and they decided to use the best people on every part.
Singer Jan Anders Boen was recruited in that process. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Humbucker">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
