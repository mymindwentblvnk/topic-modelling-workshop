THE ESOTERIC are a shining example of the determination, hard work ethic and do-it-yourself values so characteristic of their Midwestern roots. THE ESOTERIC are musicians first and foremost; with members having performed in bands ranging from hardcore pioneers COALESCE, to super-pop all-stars REGGIE AND THE FULL EFFECT, indie-rockers THETA and even noisecore stalwarts TODAY IS THE DAY.

UPDATE: Thursday, June 11, 2009: FELLOW SLEEPWALKERS AND SUBVERTERS  Q. Is The Esoteric back together again? A. Depends on how you look at it... we just played our first show in 2 years and have 2 more shows booked this month. 

Q. Is The Esoteric writing a new record? A. Members of the band are always writing music, that's just what we do. If we write something together and record it we will let you know a.s.a.p.

Q. What the hell have you dudes been up too the last few years? A. Marshall has been writing, recording, and touring with Black Light Burns and as well as with Sea Spin. Cory is with Shots Fired and the now defunct? Paper Cites. Stevie is with Hammerlord. Eric recorded the Hammerlord and Paper Cities at his EZ Rock Studios recording spots in the mid-west.  Anthony is holding it down in the shire and will be rocking out with Dillinger 4 tonight instead of coming to practice. So there you have it. It is what it is and do what it do. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Esoteric">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
