With their trademark energy and intensity, Life Or Death have forged a unique niche for themselves in the past few years. The crew from Fallbrook, CA, brings a hard, fast, and heavy style to the table that may even remind some of All Out War, Merauder, and Cold As Life. With their debut MCD, Sentenced, released on 1917 records and a huge list of live shows played, Life Or Death have established a solid spot for themselves in the hardcore and metal scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Life+Or+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
