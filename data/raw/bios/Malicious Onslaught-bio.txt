They were a thrash death metal band that had a better following over in Europe than in the United States.  Malicious Onslaught formed in 1986 in Stony Point, New York by brothers, vocalist & bassist Ted Hanauer and guitarist & vocalist Robert Hanauer.  They had a death/thrash metal sound and one of their influences was Slayer.  As time went by, they leaned more towards the death metal side.

They released a slew of demos and only two full-length albums.  Ted Hanauer was 12 years old on the first demo released in 1986.  Ted Hanauer was initially only a vocalist in the band.  He later played bass as time went by.  The albums the band released were Rebellious Mayhem (1992) and Brutal Gore (1994).  Rob Cadiz was the drummer on Brutal Gore.  These albums didn't receive that much attention in the United States.  They did get some attention Europe and Malicious Onslaught went into obscurity later on.  Robert Hanauer hanged himself in 1995. 

Ted Hanauer went on to be the do vocals and even switch to guitar after the death of his brother.  Dan Krupa joined as the bassist and Ovie Rodriguez (who is now the drummer of HavocHate) joined too.  They played a few lives shows at bars in the Rockland County area.  They released a demo entitled Corpsified Maliciously in 1995 and then they disbaned 1998. Ted Hanauer has attempted to get Malicious Onslaught going again over the years. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malicious+Onslaught">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
