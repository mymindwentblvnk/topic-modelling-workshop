Wreck of the Hesperus are a doom metal band from Dublin, Ireland. The band started playing together in January 2004 and they recorded their first demo, a four-track effort entitled Terminal Dirge in June 2004. The follow up Eulogy for the Sewer Dwellers was released in 2005.

The band's style of music is a particularly slow and heavy form of funeral doom, with guttural vocals and stoner doom influenced guitar riffs. Unusually for doom metal, the band's music frequently highlights Ray Keenaghan's drumming skills, with tracks such as Prolix featuring close to 4 minutes of drumming accompanied by nothing other than Christian choral samples.

The band's live performances feature as little interaction with the crowd as possible, with feedback filling the spaces between songs and giving the audience no chance to applaud. This bears some resemblance to the live shows of Sunn O))). The bass player dons a hooded top and keeps his back to the crowd at all times.

The band have reportedly finished work on their new album The Sunken Threshold and it is to be released in late Summer 2006. It will be 45 minutes long and feature 3 songs.

Despite the fact the band shares its name with a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, they claim to have taken their moniker from an Irish expression meaning an unpleasant state (such as a hangover) and deny deriving any inspiration from the poem. However, the album Eulogy for the Sewer Dwellers is littered with references to events in the poem.
