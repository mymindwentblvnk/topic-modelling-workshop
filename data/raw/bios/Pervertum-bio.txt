Austrian melodic black metal band featuring Trifixion of the Horned King of Trifixion, Werwolf, Pazuzu, and Summoning fame on drums, as well as local guitarists Yog Sothoth and Necros, bassist Aisthasis, and the oddly-named Black Metal Cromm on lead vocals. Notable for their unorthodox layered guitar/bass melodies, rolling percussion, and unusual vocal stylings, they came together in 1993 and dissolved sometime after the release of their first and only full-length in 1995 on Lethal Records. They were a member of the Austrian Black Metal Syndicate along with Abigor, Summoning, Pazuzu, Trifixion, and Golden Dawn. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pervertum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
