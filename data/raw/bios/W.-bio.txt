W. (aka Dr. Ill or MC van Nistelrooy) is a rapper living in Lunetten, a neighborhood in Utrecht, the Netherlands. He is also a part of the Rap-formation Radioactief, well-known from their songs "welkom in Lunetten" en "dik geld". At the moment he is working on a song called "wie-heeft-de-vlag?-mixtape", but this is still work in progress! Very promising indeed, this rapper! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/W.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
