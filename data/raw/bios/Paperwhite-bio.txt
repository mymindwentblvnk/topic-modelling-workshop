Paperwhite, brother sister Katie and Ben Marshall are a Dream-Pop duo from Brooklyn, NY. Katie is the singer and songwriter of the band. Her sophisticated melodies bounce from star to star in a lush galaxy of synthesized textures. Ben, also the drummer for Brooklyn band Savoir Adore, is the producer and co-writer. Theyâ€™re nostalgic synth riffs shimmer above heart felt chord changes and hypnotic pounding drums.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paperwhite">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
