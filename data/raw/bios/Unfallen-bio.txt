Unfallen recorded their first demo in November 2008, which obtained regards of the local scene by promoting in local gigs with bands like Through The Eyes Of The Dead (Prosthetic Records) or The Acacia Strain (Prosthetic Records). They also gained a faithful fanbase by being the first death metal band reaching the quarter finals at the 2nd Skin Rock Contest 2009, the most important musical contest of the province. They continued the promotion of their demo on a summer tour across the Quebec scene, which greated them as an “amazing rising band ready to destroy it all”. After joining Solaris Booking (booking for Quo Vadis, Blackguard, etc.), they went on an Eastern Canadian tour on support for Kataklysm (Nuclear Blast). The band entered studio in January 2010 with Jef Fortin (Neuraxis, The Last Felony, Aeternam) to record and produce their first album “Paranoia Epidemic”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Unfallen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
