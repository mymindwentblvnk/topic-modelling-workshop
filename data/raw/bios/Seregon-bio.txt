UK Thrash !

Seregon perform a mixture of Thrash- & Death Metal Forming in late 2004, Seregon have gone from strength to strength, toured the UK exstensively and continue to play many high profile shows alongside some of the best bands in a genre that mean's so much to them.

Lyrically and thematically Seregon stay firmly within existential themes, taking influence from the world around us, it's problems and successes, as we interpret them.

Our agenda for 2009/2010 is continued extensive live coverage at home and abroad, coupled with the release and promotion of an upcoming 7 track EP as well as continued support of 2007's 'Kingdom of the Blind' EP.
