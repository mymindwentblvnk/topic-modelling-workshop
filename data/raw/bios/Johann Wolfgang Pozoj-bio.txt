Johann Wolfgang Pozoj is an avant-garde black metal band from Croatia that came to existence in 2004 by merging of two “brother” bands - Intoxicate and Grob (Grave). The band’s name is derived from (pre) Indo-European myth about a dragon (Pozoj) and its later mythological and lingual derivations.

The first part of their opus is a Trilogy based on myth and the philosophical triad of thesis, antithesis and synthesis where those three phases represent the spirit becoming real through art.

The first album in the Trilogy – Birth of Pozoj represents the Trilogy’s symbolic phase where the idea hasn’t yet found its complete form, and the birth of the dragon (Pozoj) as a symbolic beginning of time flow. The album was released in 2006 via Progressive Attack Records.

Soon after, the band went through line-up changes and in 2007 Ivan Borcic joined the band as the new vocal and lyricist replacing Darko Simunovic, while Slaven Milic joined as the new bass player, replacing Domagoj Soic. Together with the three remaining founding members – Filip Fabek and Marko Balaban on guitars and Luka Kovac on drums, in 2009 the quintet began recording the second part of their Trilogy named Escape of Pozoj. Following the Trilogy’s philosophy, the album represents the peak of fertility and growth, maturity and completely becoming real where the idea is fulfilling its purpose and Pozoj is leaving its mother nature.

Escape of Pozoj was self-released in the summer of 2009 in 1,000 copies and was soon recognized by both fans and critics as a modern classic. In 2010 it landed them a record deal with Italian label code666 which will (re)release the entire Trilogy.
