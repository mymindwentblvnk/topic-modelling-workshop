There are 2 bands named Eternidad:

1) Eternidad (sometimes stylized as xEternidadx) are a straight edge hardcore band from MÃ©rida, Mexico formed in 2010.

2) Eternidad is a prog folk band from Argentina with a lineup of musicians including Daniel Mendez on acoustic & electric guitar, harmonica, vocals, Roberto Mendez on acoustic & electric guitar, lute, vocals, Claudio Pedra on piano, Fender Rhodes, Hammond organ, synthesizer, Robi Massarotto on bass, vocals, and Luis Yanes on drums, percussion. Their only album is "Apertura" released in 1979. The band are very obscure, as they disbanded a year after the album was released. 

The music is laced with folk elements, some fusion elements, symphonic layers, and strong melodies. Highlights include the symphonic 'Suite: Pensamiento Y Vida', and 'Cueno De Una Nina' with its swathes of keyboards and solid infectious choruses. There are passages of flute and an emphasis on lengthy instrumental sections with a soothing tranquil atmosphere. The album has been re-issued on CD in 2004 by Mardel-X.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eternidad">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
