There are two bands called Nomada.

1) Pop-Rock artist.

2) The five-membered Nomada ('Nomads') was founded by Roma singer-guitarist Balogh Guszt√°v in 2003. The music of Nomada is derived from Hungarian Gypsy tradition, yet it creates an utterly unique sound by blending various styles. The water can, the oral base, and the rhythm guitar provides the estam (the kontras of the songs), but this characteristic Gypsy singing and rhythmatic pattern is further enriched and embellished by the grooves of the drums and the bass guitar. Nomada melds Gypsy folklore with Spanish, Arabic, and Serbian folk music elements. www.nomada.hu <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Nomada">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
