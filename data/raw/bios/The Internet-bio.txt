The Internet, comprising vocalist/rapper/DJ Syd Tha Kid and producer Matt Martians, were introduced in 2011 as affiliates of the controversial hip-hop crew Odd Future. The group debuted in the fall of 2011 with the release of the track "Love Song -1 -2." Mixing '80s synth pop, neo-soul, hip-hop, and trip-hop, their debut album, Purple Naked Ladies, followed that same year with a digital release. A physical version arrived in early 2012 on the Odd Future label. The album Feel Good arrived in 2013 with a much cooler and softer sound. Two years later Ego Death brought back the heavier beats, along with guest appearances from Janelle Mon√°e and Vic Mensa. ~ David Jeffries <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Internet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
