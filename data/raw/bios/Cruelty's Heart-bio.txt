Cruelty's Heart is a pagan/black metal band with Anglo-Saxon historical and folkloric themes based in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Originally hailing from Southampton, England, Cruelty’s Heart was formed during an inhumane drunken week at Wacken Open Air 2009 by Bloodletter and Aske. After recruiting another disciple, Simon, to play bass, the trio began writing and rehearsing over the autumn and roughly recorded some ideas in December that year.

The first rough demo tracks were recorded rehearsals of old thrash songs from previous projects which Bloodletter had been involved with. These were rewritten with some added Immortal, Burzum and Gorgoroth influences however soon afterwards an atmospheric, melodic pagan metal sound began to develop which was captured in the 2011 demo, entitled 'Die For Woden'.

By the autumn of 2011 though, Aske had drifted away from the project for various, but much clichéd, musical differences. Simon and Bloodletter sought to find a new drummer in order to follow up on the demo, however this seemed impossible within the music scene in Southampton. Eventually Simon left due to commitments to other bands which left Bloodletter to fold the project or carry on alone. He decided to carry on and began writing an EP.

In June 2012, Cruelty's Heart signed to Wodfreca Records and released 'Rex Anglorvm Saxonvm' in December. Within this time, the project had been relocated with Bloodletter to Copenhagen, Denmark. The current lineup, as of June 2013, includes Bloodletter on vocals and guitars, Jens Christian Forsberg-Olesen on vocals and bass, and Mikael Dupont on drums.

Now signed to UKEM Records, Cruelty's Heart will be releasing a split album with the band Frostwork early in 2014.
