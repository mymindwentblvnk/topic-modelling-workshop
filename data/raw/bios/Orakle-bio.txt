Orakle is a black metal band from Paris, France. They first formed in 1994 by 14 year-old friends named Clevdh (Drums) and Achernar (Vocals, bass, synth). They made several demo-tapes and a CD called 'Neath the Rapture Streams' (1999), and later a more mature EP 'L'ineffable Ã‰moi... De Ce Qui Existe' (2002). Through these early recordings, both musicians patiently developed their skills, ideas, and music.
Then came Amar Ru (Guitars) in 2002, and enough confidence to build the seven songs of their first album 'Uni aux cimes', which was released in 2005 by Melancholia Records and immediately welcomed as a majestic inspired piece of black metal.
After a few more shows, Eithenn joined the band as an official member on guitar in 2007. Orakle signed a deal with the famous label Holy Records, thus giving birth to their second full-length opus 'Tourments & Perdition' in 2008, featuring 7 songs of dark, progressive, emotional and challenging black metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Orakle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
