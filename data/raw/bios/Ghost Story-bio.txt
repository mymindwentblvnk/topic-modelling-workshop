Ghost Story was a decision made by band members of Crux that ultimatetly felt so far removed from what they had done and been and experienced, and now so fervently immersed in what they want to say and what they want to express that it just came time to severe the ties to the past and start new. Ghost story is not "formerly known" as Crux, it is a completely different band that coincidently has the same members. It's not a pretentious "we grew out of it" it is just that this is who we were all along, and only now do we realize it. Our music has become more something we feel emotionally attached to and our message is finally apparent to us, and our band name is a direct reflection of all these components. But one thing remains the same, were a band that loves our music and loves playing live and no matter what sounds we are making and what progressions were using, it is all self serving first. We do everything with the priority that we are happy with it and we will be proud of it even if no one else cares about it and no one wants to see it.
