Technical and atmospheric Norwegian death metal. Precursor to Borknagar, but musically very dissimilar. Molested was formed in Bergen in May 1991 by Ã˜ystein G. Bruun on guitars and Erlend Erichsen on drums. Initially they were known as Purgation but they soon changed it into Molested. A month later Kenneth Lian (bass) and Trond Turnes (guitars) joined to complete the lineup. Released their only full-length, Blod-draum, in 1995. Split after releasing the Stormvold EP in 1997. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Molested">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
