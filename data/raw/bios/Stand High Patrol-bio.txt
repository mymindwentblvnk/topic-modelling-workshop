STAND HIGH is a sound system born in 2000 in the heart of Brittany.  Originally, two friends started collecting records with the aim of sharing their passion for oldies roots and early digital productions.  ROOTYSTEP (selecta) and Mc GYVER (operator) are quickly joined by PUPA JIM who becomes the official MC of the sound.  The STAND HIGH starts to turn and, little by little, the sound is moving towards the dub stepper productions which emanate from the English scene.

 Newly landed in Rennes, ROOTYSTEP and MACGYVER launched an attack on RADIO CAMPUS RENNES, where they hosted their own show from 2003 to 2008. PUPA JIM created their first dubs and, from then on, the sound went on dates in the bars of Rennes.

 Quickly, the duplates fall on all sides.  From 2005, the sound plays 100% duplicates!  100% exclusive!  Which led him to quickly share the poster with the big names in the soundsystem scene.

 Over the years STAND HIGH PATROL has developed a particular dub which incorporates a large repertoire of personal influences.  This style called "Dubadub", carried by the voice of Pupajim and by a full range of effects, is defined as a clever mix of dub, Hip Hop, bass music, and digital reggae;  all cleverly interspersed with trip hop, techno and new wave accents.  Built on the model of Hip Hop beats, with big hits of bass, kick and clap, the "Dubadub" is a hybrid and dynamic style which finds its followers as much among fans of dub as among fans of electronic music.

 The three "Dubadub Muskateerz" today continue to string together the evenings alongside the big names of the European dub scene while running their own label: STAND HIGH RECORDS <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stand+High+Patrol">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
