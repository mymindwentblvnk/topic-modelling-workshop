The love affair continues. Like two schoolgirls living richly in a self devised world of cave trolls and tormented princesses, Miss Murgatroid (aka Alicia J. Rose) and Petra Haden mesh their collective imaginations to deliver majestic themes culled from the ether itself. Reuniting after more than a six year hiatus, Miss M and Miss Haden convene anew for another bout of ebullient sonic symbiosis.

Their last effort, Bella Neurox, met with critical acclaim and delighted fan frenzy. Their simple but unique combination of accordion, violin and voice delved into waters deep and strange, with a mix of vocals and instrumentals that transported the listener to eerie dark alleys, lush Italian seasides and the false bottoms of haunted toychests.

Their newest effort ­ Hearts & Daggers, offers 9 new tracks of absolute symphonic loveliness. Fueled by mutual heartache, spectral visions, grandiose baroque fantasies and their undying fondness for one another’s brains, Miss M and Petra have truly outdone themselves. Layering vocals, violin, viola and accordion in ways that will utterly enchant and intrigue the listener, this is a true labor of love that defies as many genres as it is influenced by.

Daughter of legendary jazz bassist Charlie Haden, Petra was a founding member of girl pop sensations that dog and has worked with many fancily panted superstars - Beck, Luscious Jackson, The Rentals, Cibo Matto, Sean Lennon, Foo Fighters, Spain, Victoria Williams and Rickie Lee Jones amongst others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Miss+Murgatroid+And+Petra+Haden">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
