1.) Black metal band from Oslo, Norway, which was formed in 1992 under the name Demonic Manifesto. Became Demonic in 1994. Lyrics are about Satan and demons.
This band is not active anymore. Their last and only full-length album "The Empire of Agony" was released in 1997. Fiend, went underground and released a few extremely limited underground demos / projects under the name of Pest, Svartgaldr, Slaktar, and Nukleus.

Demonic was founded by Witchdemon and Fiend in the year of 1992. They released a demo tape titled "Når mørket faller" (When Darkness Falls) in the autumn of the same year. This demo tape was pretty much sold out before they even got their hands on it themselves, so after exporting like 500, they decided to sign on some label. They were supposed to re-release the demo together with the ultimate Aussie one-man band, Abyssic Hate, but since he didn't get along with Necropolis Recs, and their terms, that release never came to place. Never the less, Demonic signed up for a MCD, on Necro, to release the demo plus a new track titled "His Eyes Burns Hate" wich is this MCD "Lead Us Into Darkness".

Demonic recorded all their stuff in the famous Grieghallen in Bergen, 92-96, under the sparkling knots of Pytten "Dæn e brun... i saus" (Grieghallen Studios), or as they recall "Dæn e go', pyttemann’n" (damari er heldi, bare så det er sagt).
