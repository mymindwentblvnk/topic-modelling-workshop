Divercia is a progressive gothic metal band from Finland. They were formed in 1994, initially known as Lost In Twilight. By 1998 a lineup was set (minus a vocalist), and they decided to record their first album, Descending Mist, as an instrumental album. A year later they acquired a vocalist, and in 2001 they released Planeteer, still as Lost In Twilight. The following year they signed to Hammerheart Records, and at that time they changed name to Divercia, and have since released two more albums. Their style, as heard on their recent Cycle Of Zero album, seems to slot somewhere between power metal and prog metal, but they really aren't either -- they thankfully don't have the happy choruses and rollicking drums/riffs of so many Euro power metal bands, and though the keyboards give them a prog edge, they don't really fit there either. Divercia therefore is one of those familiar yet original bands, the kind that draw from several influences but don't fall prey to cloning another band or genre. Still a young band, these guys could have a strong future in front of them.
