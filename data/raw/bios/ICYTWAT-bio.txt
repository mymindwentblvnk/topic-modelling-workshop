ICYTWAT is an underground american producer and rapper.  Heâ€™s worked with many artists including A$AP Rocky, Playboi Carti, UnoTheActivist, Thoto, and more. Starting his discography with smoother, more euphoric sounds, ICYTWAT's music and style has evolved over the course of his career, eventually turning into a harder, vintage, dark, Memphis-influenced tone. Not many are aware of his presence, but the ones that do, stick around. He currently has a heavily anticipated project coming soon with long-time collaborator Thoto, under the name, "THOTTWAT." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ICYTWAT">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
