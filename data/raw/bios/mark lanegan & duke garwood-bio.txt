American alternative rock musician and singer-songwriter Mark Lanegan (1964 - 2022) previously worked with Isobel Campbell, Greg Dulli, and was a member of The Screaming Trees, Queens of the Stone Age, and Soulsavers. “Duke Garwood is one of my all time favorite artists,” said Lanegan. “Working with him has been one of the best experiences of my recording life.” Lanegan and Garwood met while playing on the same bill and Garwood was a frequent opener on some of Lanegan’s  European tour dates. 

Garwood has often been described in the press as Lanegan’s “spiritual cousin across the Atlantic waters.” He has been widely praised as a master bluesman, with The Quietus saying “The combination of Garwood’s murmured vocals and the sound he gets out of his guitar – which ranges from a rolling, loose finger-picking to shuddering howls of feedback – has a hypnotic effect” and The Mirror dubbing him as “London’s leading exponent of the wheezy broke-down blues.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Lanegan+&+Duke+Garwood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
