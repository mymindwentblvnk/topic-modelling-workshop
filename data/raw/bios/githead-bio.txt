The appearance of Githead and the release of their debut EP Headgit in 2004 surprised many, not only because of the unlikely 'front line' of Wire's Colin Newman (guitar/vocals), Minimal Compact's Malka Spigel (bass, vocals) and Scanner's Robin Rimbaud (guitar), but also due to the band's cyclic, hypnotic funkiness, not to mention their avant-pop sensibility.

The band's genesis was in the proverbial 'one off' as part of the celebrations of Newman's record label Swim's 10th anniversary, but it quickly became apparent that the band was more than a mere collection of individuals and that it was able to generate its own style with an ease that escapes many better-starred collaborations. 

Initially 'drummerless', the band wrote and rehearsed in Swim's otherwise over-cramped studio from the outset, thus guaranteeing that all outbreaks of creative genius could be instantly recorded. This meant that as well as building up a repertoire, the band was also recording towards an end of released material, and subsequently able to fairly rapidly develop enough finished material to enable selections to be made for release. 

Thus the debut EP Headgit was released before the band had played its third gig, and material towards the debut album, 2005's Profile was already in the works before the band had even played two gigs! 

The first three shows were performed without a live drummer, but it had always been the band's intention to be able play with live drums. Various applicants were considered, but in the end it was perhaps inevitable that Max Franken from Malka's band Minimal Compact would be the man to fill the drum stool. 

The 4 piece released their sophomore effort, Art POP in 2007.
