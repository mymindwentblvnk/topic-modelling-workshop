Ovuca is Aleksi Perälä, an artist on Rephlex Records. 

He was born in 1976 in Finland. From 1993-1994 he lived in Michigan as an exchange student. Following piles demos sent in from 1994-1998, Perälä was finally rewarded a record deal after Rephlex heard his soundtrack to a Finnish porn movie. Perälä has been known for his braindance ever since. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ovuca">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
