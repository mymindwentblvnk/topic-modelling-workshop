2)  We grew up together. We discovered the pleasures of Mario Kart, Racquetball, The Letter "N" and, especially, Music together. We recorded 3 albums of strange, angular, exuberant, loud post-punk-y mayhem together in Portland that make sense only to us: The Summer of Promises Kept (2003) Heights (2004) You Can Know Danger (2006). We have played shows here, there and other places with many good bands and good friends. We are now making a 4th record of something completely different. Miniaturist, minimalist, nearly percussionless, prog folks songs. We are diligent and methodical in giving each new song a working title that corresponds to video game in sequential alphabetical order (Arkanoid, Bubble Bobble, Castelvanie etc.). Video games are not acoustic, but we now are. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/At+Dusk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
