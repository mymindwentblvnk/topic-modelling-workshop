"FAITH BURIED IN FLAMES" originally started as a three-piece band, all born and raised in Stanton, NE. Their original bass player had to leave the band in 2007, and Chris Schoenberg was added on guitar. Most recently, "F.B.I.F." has called on the talent of Dan Schoenberg on the bass. All of the band members have had a lot of experience playing shows in the Nebraska music scene. John doing double time with "Helldorado", drumming for "Primal Waters", and previously the Nebraska metal favorites "The Lifeless Design", Justin doing double time with "Helldorado" and previously the hard rock band "Empathy", Dan shredding guitar in "Primal Waters", and Chris shredding guitar in "Primal Waters", his solo act "The Chris Schoenberg Total Package" and previously the punk rock band "The Gremlins". "F.B.I.F." is now residing in Norfolk, NE. Influences include Lamb of God, Pantera, Machine Head, Devildriver, A Life Once Lost, The Black Dahlia Murder, Jack Daniels, Marlboro, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Budweiser, as well as many other bands. Currently in the process of mastering the all new material for their first full length album (which they are shopping around for labels), the band has come up with some of the most technical brutality to ever come out of the midwest. Expect big things from "F.B.I.F." in the next year. They are as determined as ever to get their brand of metal out to the masses and to be a breakthrough act in the Nebraska metal scene.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Faith+Buried+In+Flames">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
