Orphanage was a Dutch  innovative gregorian groovy celtic melodic danceable doom death metal band, which existed from 1987 till 2005. They were one of the first Dutch metal bands who mixed death metal grunts with clean female vocals. By mixing very different musical styles they have created their own unique sound.

In 1996, an era in which several new metal-styles and cross-overs arose in the landscape of metal, they described their style as "Innovative gregorian groovy celtic melodic danceable doom death metal" (great lastfm tag!!)

Mid October 2005, after 11 years, the band split up. The official announcement stated: "From recent internal discussions it appeared that there was too much irritation and a lack of mutual trust, to be able to make a new Orphanage product, by the high quality standards that the band has been known for throughout the years.".

Singer George Oosthoek is still frequently seen in the Dutch metal scene, performing as guest vocalist for other metal-bands (like Delain, After Forever and Within Temptation) or in his own bands like Pleurisy. Guus Eikens became a member of Delain and works with them on studio records (music writing and guitars) but he don't play live on stage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Orphanage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
