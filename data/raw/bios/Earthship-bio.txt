EARTHSHIP surge ahead like a nuclear-powered icebreaker through the Barents Sea, laden with mighty riffs, tons of groove and home-brewn whiskey.

Join the EARTHSHIP's bearded crew, led by captain Jan Oberg (former drummer of THE OCEAN) for a ride through the vast black sea of doom and prog'n'roll. Featuring The Ocean's Robin Staps on guitar.
