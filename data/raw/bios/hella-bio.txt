Hella began in 2001 in Sacramento, USA as a two member band consisting of Zach Hill and Spencer Seim writing technically intricate music of a highly spastic nature. They play a blend of math rock and noise rock. On early albums, the band forged their classic sound, playing minimally arranged, abrasive instrumentals that still retain an idiosyncratic sense of melody.

In 2005, the band expanded their live band by adding Dan Elkan on vocals, rhythm guitar, and synth and Jonathan Hischke on bass guitar. In 2006, Hella's line-up was expanded to include Hill's cousin, Josh Hill (guitar), Spencer's Advantage bandmate Carson McWhirter (bass) and Aaron Ross (Vocals).

Since 2009, Hella's lineup is back to the original two-piece of Zach Hill and Spencer Seim, and in August of 2011 they released their latest album, Tripper, on Sargent House. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hella">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
