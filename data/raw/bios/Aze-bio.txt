Apart from each other they are Beyza and Ezgi, together they form Aze. They grew up together and have been making music for 10 years. They say the more time you spend with a person the more like them you become. This allowed two rather different personalities to grow alongside while maintaining a nearly identical core – Music as the Golden Middle. Aze is alive because two independent artists put their heart and soul on the table and each person brings their own preference and habits into play.

So instead of limiting themselves to only one Genre, they choose to welcome life’s fluctuations. RnB, Jazz and Hip Hop have a heavy influence on their sound just as much as oriental music does. Every Genre, every instrument and every language has the potential of new ways of producing sound and feelings. Music offers “space” to feel, to speak up and to process. That’s why a lot of their songs discuss topics starting from hopeless love to struggling in between two cultures growing up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aze">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
