Bizarrekult was formed back in 2006 as a response to the chaos of the surroundings and already with a first demo got attention through 2000 copy split CD release. However, following the second studio demo and then a two track rehearsal demo in Bergen, the project was laid on ice. Many moons have passed since then and surviving the hardships of life, Bizarrekult is reborn in a totally different environment, incorporating the best of the two different yet somewhat similar worlds.

Current line-up:
BIZARRE - Vocals, guitar, bass
Dina - Vocals
ADV - Drums
Ignat - Guitars, bass (member of Adliga ) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bizarrekult">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
