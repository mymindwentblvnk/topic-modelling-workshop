Martial Canterel (previously called Moravagine) is a minimal wave/synth project by Sean McBride from New York. The project has been renamed for his first officially released album "Confusing Outsides" (2005), because there are already two other bands using the name Moravagine. Martial Canterel records and performs using only vintage analogue synthesizers and sequencers, producing a highly-crafted, complex, and idiosyncratic form of electronic music that is simultaneously romantically melancholic and affirmatively aggressive. Inspired both by the first wave of relatively unknown minimal electronic bands in Northern Europe(a musical genre also often referred to as ‘minimal synth‘) and the seminal industrial noise bands such as Throbbing Gristle, SPK and Cabaret Voltaire, Martial Canterel presents a new optimistic paradigm for electronic music in which the analogue synthesizer functions anew as a folk instrument of humanist resistance to a virtual ‘soft synth‘, iPod, and iTunes saturated world of ‘click and drag‘ dematerialized abstraction.
Sean is also a member of the following projects: Xeno And Oaklander (with Miss Liz Wendelbo), Three To Forgotten (together with Miss Liz Wendelbo & Cheyney Thompson)
