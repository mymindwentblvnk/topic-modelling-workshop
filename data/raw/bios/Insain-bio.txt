INSAIN.. is a Parisian band formed at the end of ..2007.. by David (guitar) and Seb (vocals), joined few weeks later by Tibo (bass) and Jonathan (drums). The core Objective is to play brutal and fast music inspired by some great US and Polish bands, thus conserving a simple and humble approach in composition.
