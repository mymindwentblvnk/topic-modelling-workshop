        The beer swilling demon known as Brewhemoth was born in Moorpark, CA and the members were originally from Sarin, a group forming late in the year 2000 as a group of friends/musicians in their senior year of high school.  The group was strongly influenced by Pantera and the early works of Metallica. They continued playing until 2004 when some of their members left to pursue their own interests around the world. The three remaining members struggled through this "Brief Defeat" and took it on as their new name while they searched for a new member to hold the vocal reigns for the group.  

    After a couple years of disappointment's the group decided to take the responsibility of heading up the vocals themselves with the decision to split the responsibility between the guitarist Juan and bassist Javier, the group now seemed unstoppable.  After playing several shows and finally owning their new sound the band opted to change their name to Brewhemoth and so the demon was unleashed upon the land. They are set to release their first self produced album in December 2008.
