Hailing from central Britanny (France), STONEBIRDS came out in 2008 as a quintet, inspired by both surrounding deserted landscapes and bands like Queens Of The Stone Age, Kyuss, The Melvins and Alice In Chains. Strongly influenced by these well known acts, STONEBIRDS first records a 10 tracks demo entitled « Slow Fly » back in 2011, totally DIY stuff, but already releasing the rare feeling and groove of US desert rock bands.

Following years saw many changes in the band’s lineup : founding member Fañch (guitar/vocals) remained at the helm whereas the band was moving from 5 to 3 members, including himself, Sylvain (bass, from The Dying Seed, Axenis) and Antoine (drums, from Noisy Shed). In a couple of year STONEBIRDS evolves from a typically desert rock style to something heavier and sludgy and records « Kreiz-Breizh Sessions vol. 1″, a split CD with their crazy doom mates from STANGALA, and a live Ep called « The Mirabelle’s Night ». The « Kreiz-Breizh Sessions » received a very warm welcome and many reviews underlined the band’s maestria in making solid and fuzzy songs.

STONEBIRDS, among a long list of live shows, toured twice, a France/Uk tour in 2013 and an extensive french tour during summer 2014. New album « Into the fog… and the filthy air » has been released on July 14th 2015 through Pink Tank Records (Ger). Recorded live at Kerwax Studio (France). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/stonebirds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
