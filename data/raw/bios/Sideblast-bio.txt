Since 2004, France's very own Sideblast has been carving their own unique style of death, black, and thrash metal by utilizing power rage and melody in ways no one has seen before. With their upcoming "Flight of a Moth" full length record it is safe to say that this search has ended.

Putting a face on Sideblast's sound is not an easy task. The band draws their influences from Emperor, Strapping Young Lad, Immortal, and Behemoth, but still manages to dominate over the endless plethora of imitators through their self-critiquing use of sound bytes in their songs and near-symphonic keyboard samples. All this coupled with the band's patented manically ear/shattering/yet/intelligent approach to music, Sideblast are a force to be reckoned with.

"Flight of a Moth" promises, nay... demands to bring this one-of-a-kind sound to the ears of all the fans  of heavy music. Mastered at the Jailhouse Studios by Tommy Hansen (Helloween, Hatesphere), Sideblast is more than ever determined to reach as many people as possible and roam the surface of the earth to be finally known by all metalheads.
