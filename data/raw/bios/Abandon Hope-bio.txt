2) Abandon Hope plays old school trash metal and heavy metal. 

The band was created in the sommer of 2002 by singer Hommel and guitar-player JÃ¶rg in Warendorf, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany. Bass-player Max was quickly found. After a change at the drums, the band found the right man in sommer 2003 with Alex.

They released their first 4-tracks-long CD in autumn/winter of 2003. The next, real, album has been released in summer 2006.
 
The band's name means nothing else than: 
"Let the pure hope of a better morning behind - change yourself in the first place - nothing else will change before that."
