Violent Deception is a Heavy Metal band hailing from Hull, UK. The band play a style that incorporates Thrash/Power and Traditional Heavy Metal to create our their own distinct sound. Formed around September 2008, the band has been focused on writing and developing our their songs, rather than wasting their time with covers as so many other bands do. At first the band (made up of guitarists Hector and Jon (also the vocalist) had lineup troubles with finding a Bass player, until close friend Reece offered his skills in the rhythm department. Unfortunately, Chris decided to depart from the band in late 2008, causing them to go through a series of drummers that didn’t quite fit the profile. However, in early 2009, Violent Deception became a fully functional 4 piece band, with the addition of Phil on drums, who are committed to writing their own material and raising their profile in their local rock/metal scene. The band’s influences are obvious in such songs as “I Am Fear”, “The Ripper” and “Metal Warriors”.
