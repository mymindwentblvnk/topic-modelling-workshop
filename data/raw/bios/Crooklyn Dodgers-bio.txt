The Crooklyn Dodgers is a hip-hop supergroup based in Brooklyn, NY. They have appeared in three separate incarnations since 1994. The first two incarnations recorded for the soundtracks of Spike Lee films, Crooklyn and Clockers, respectively.

The first group was composed of Special Ed, Masta Ace, and Buckshot. Their contribution was the track "Crooklyn," produced by Ali Shaheed Muhammed of A Tribe Called Quest, and featured in the 1994 film of the same name.

The second group was composed of Chubb Rock, O.C., and Jeru the Damaja. They collaborated on record "Return of the Crooklyn Dodgers," produced by DJ Premier and featured in the 1995 film Clockers. This incarnation was credited as Crooklyn Dodgers '95.

North Carolina producer 9th Wonder resurrected the group concept in 2006 for a track on his album Dream Merchant Vol. 2, titled "Brooklyn in My Mind (Crooklyn Dodgers Part 3)". The new incarnation consisted of Jean Grae, Mos Def and Memphis Bleek. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crooklyn+Dodgers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
