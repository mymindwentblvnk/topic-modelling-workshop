After more than a decade of continuous releases, Hopewell has become an institution in the indie space rock scene. Weathering music industry collapse, stylistic shifts and near fatal personal conflicts, the tenacious band continues to pump out genre defying music to critical acclaim. A series of releases in the late 90's brought them to Europe's festival circuit, Peel Sessions, and NME fame. The results of this pressure were nearly catastrophic for the small town band, spawned in Hopewell Jct, NY. Hospitals and institutions were employed. Hopewell rallied around the stormy Dave Fridmann produced "Hopewell & The Birds of Appetite". What followed was a period of constant touring, culminating in 2007's release of the joyful "Beautiful Targets", an album that is the sound of a band celebrating its survival. Hopewell's 5th and most ambitious work is well underway. Somehow melding Can and Roxy Music with a touch of early tribal Janeâ€™s Addiction, the group is zeroing in on it's musical holy grail: the transmutation of their live show to tape.
