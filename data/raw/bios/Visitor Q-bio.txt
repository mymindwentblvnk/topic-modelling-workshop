"Fusing elements of hardcore, prog-metal and the simmering undercurrents of dementia into a neat untroubled delivery, brazen innovators of just-for-the-fuck-of-it heavy metal style in the city, Visitor Q are the anticonscience of Dublin heavy metal..."

We started playing together in 2007, under the name Wyvern. Our first set of songs were more straight ahead with a thrash metal feel to them.
Since then we've experimented with more progressive and heavier styles of metal and changed our name to Visitor Q. We feel we've finally found our own sound and have been playing some of the best gigs we've ever played and writing some of the best material we've ever written.

We are currently rehearsing and writing alot of new material aswell as gigging all over the country.We have recently recorded a brand new four song EP called "Vile Regression"more details coming soon!

Changed name in 2009 to Vile Regression. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Visitor+Q">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
