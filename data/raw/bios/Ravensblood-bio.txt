Ravensblood was born during summer 2001. This french horde performs a fast and brutal black metal with pagan lyrics. After some line-up changes, the two remaining members (CG: vocals and SC: instruments) recorded their first demo called "A New Blizzard Shall Come" which has recently been re-released as a split tape with Memorial through Ewiger Hass Productions (by the way it was limited to only 150 copies and is sold out for now). Now, mightier than ever thanks to the furious vocals of Wolfnacht (Ornaments Of Sin), the band releases its first album: "From The Tumulus Depths" (both CD and gatefold picture LP versions has been released through Christhunt Productions).

Changed name in 2006: the band is now called Hybrid. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ravensblood">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
