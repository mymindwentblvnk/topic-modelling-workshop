Gontyna Kry is a Polish Black Metal band founded by Warterz "Bard" Neur, and Komes Lupul Kurhan in the winter of 1993.  The lyrics deal mostly with heathen heritage, initiation of battle rituals, philosophy and the legacy of great Slavonic tribes.  Gontyna Kry is meant to stand for "Temple of Blood" in Proto-Slavic language. 
The new albums "The Blood Of Our Fathers" & "Arystokracja Ducha" have been produced independently by Bard Neur and has a sound similar to newer Emperor combined with some slight death metal stylings in riff construction. 

The next album of Gontyna Kry will be recorded in 2010 and will feature Piaty from Kataxu on vocals.
Warterz Neur is also a member of Aetheres.
