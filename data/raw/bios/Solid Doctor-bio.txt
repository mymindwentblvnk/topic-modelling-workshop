Solid Doctor is Steve Cobby who, alongside David 'Porky' Brennand, was the dominant creative force behind popular Hull-based label Pork Recordings, for whom he recorded a number of full-length albums under a variety of names (including Fila Brazillia and Heights of Abraham).  He released two full-length lp's (one of them, How About Some Ether?, a double-disc compilation of singles) and helped attract critical attention to Pork with a blend of instrumental hip-hop, dub, funk, and house that would soon propel labels such as Mo'Wax and Cup of Tea into the spotlight. Cobby's Solid Doctor material carves out a space between the dancefloor and the hi-fi, aiming for a middle ground of groove with songwriting and musicianship given equal weight with the more practical consideration of moving a crowd. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Solid+Doctor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
