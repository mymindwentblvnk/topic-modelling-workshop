Kvrga (drums), Mishel (guitar), Glax (guitar) and Dac(bass) started to play some metal music in spring 2004. Since metal isn't so popular in our hometown of Kutina we haven't progressed fast. There were some pauses between rehearsals but we managed to play more and more covers of In Flames, and made 3 of our own songs.

In the autumn of 2005 Koshpa (vocals) joined the band and started writing some lyrics. The bands' first live performance took place at Organizirani Kaos (Organized Chaos) 11 fest in our hometown Kutina, Croatia.In the autumn of 2006 we had a lineup change. Kvrga (drums) has left the band 'cause he got a job in Zagreb and he wants to graduate finally. Because of that we haven't rehearsed in 3 months so we found a replacement Brane. Soon after Dac (bass) left the band, so we found a temporary bass player, Che, who also plays bass in our friendly band Gregzeye. He was our session player for few months. We're very thankful for his help.

In the spring of 2007 we found new bass player. Kela joined the band and he will certainly add a new dimension to our music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moltencore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
