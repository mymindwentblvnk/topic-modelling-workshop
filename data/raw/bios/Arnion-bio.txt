The Brazilian metal group ARNION started working on the local metal scene in early 2003 with their music straight out of the 80´s and 90´s thrash metal style. Inspired by metal titans like Kreator, Exodus, Slayer, and Living Sacrifice the band started gaining respect and the attention of the local scene.

In 2006, the band achieved notoriety by releasing a Demo EP entitled: Refuge. Creating a local undergound buzz, the group got the attention of Brazilian label SILENT MUSIC RECORDS.

In August 2008, Silent Music Records´s support, the band releases their debut album, "Fall Like Rain." Immediately the band gained a whirlwind of undergound buzz in the Brazilian metal scene. Thrash metal band fans and the media alike were floored with the quality and talent of this new band's debut release.

"ARNION" is an ancient Greek word from the Bible meaning "lamb, or lamb of God." Breaking trends, preconception, and paradigms between music, attitude and faith, the group focuses their music on a powerful, aggressive, and heavy thrash metal style, delivering metal attitude with an intelligent message to metal fans worldwide. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arnion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
