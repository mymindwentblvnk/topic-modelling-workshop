Surface of Eceon (also known as Surface of Eceyon), is a supergroup of sorts from Portland, Oregon whose music has been described as ambient, space rock.

This unit, which has a penchant for the phantasmagoric, includes members of from Landing and Yume Bitsu, two notable post-rock groups. Their allegories have led some to dub them Mothmen, an unfortunate conflation of a moniker used by another notable musical collective from the 1980s. That group, now defunct, included members of Simply Red and The Durutti Column.

The first fruit of this sensational collaboration came in late 2001 in the form of The King Beneath the Mountain. The title references "The Grasshopper King" (of the album's third track) who, according to the liner notes, rules the "Surface of Eceon," a land "beyond the outer reaches of Dryystn," where "time and energy are blurred into a beautiful landscape of sound and action." While this brief, whimsical mythology might sound like the byproduct of a little too much Herbert or Heinlein or Ursula K. LeGuin, it nonetheless provides a delightful context for the phantasmagorical musical delights within. The King Beneath the Mountain contains six torpid, improvisation-driven inquiries into the hidden secrets of the cosmos, including the featured "Deep Gray Night," a mellow effects-laden wash of synths, layered guitars, and surf-like percussion that feels like a slow trip through the murky nocturnal waters of a distant planet.

The original lineup:

Aaron Snow: guitar, synthesizer, vocals;
Adam Forkner: guitar, vocals;
Dick Baldwin: guitar;
Daron Gardner: bass guitar;
Phil Jenkins: percussion.
