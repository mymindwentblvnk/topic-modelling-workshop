The German Heavy Rockband ARREST was basicly founded in September 1992 (first Idea to form a band). It takes then two more years since Sommer 1994 they became one of the well acknowledged Live-Rock-Acts in their region.
Right from the beginning homemade, honest Heavy Rock-Music, which is not influenced by any trends, is one of the priorities. Still from these early days the band founding members Ralf Weber, Frank Doleczik and Alex Weinrauch are together.
