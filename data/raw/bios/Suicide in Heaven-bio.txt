Suicide In Heaven is Metal band from Indonesia. We come to have and give some fun for all of you. We formed in November, 2007. We have been influenced by metal band like, As I Lay Dying, Parkway Drive, August Burns Red, Unearth, and many more.

We have vision, that we will play this kind of music until we die. We wanna have some show around Indonesia and around The World. We hope that we will have that chance, we believe it. Let's join us, support us, and keep your hands up with us. God Bless us all. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Suicide+In+Heaven">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
