Packing a background as exotic as it is homegrown, Atlanta-based Haitian/Dominican songwriter Stacy Barthe has earned a startstudded client list in her short time on the scene.

With credits for the likes of Black Eyed Peas, Britney Spears, Keri Hilson, Enrique Iglesias, New Kids on the Block, Ciara, Tiffany Evans, Cassie, and Diddy to name a few, Barthe has become one of the most indemand young songwriting talents. So much so that Universal Music Publishing took notice of her work, and signed her to their already impressive assembly.

Barthe's work combines a nostalgic noise with unique new sounds, and just like her idols Diane Warren and Martha Walsh, she is masterfully coupling lyrics rife with raw emotion with uninhibited music.

"As I have observed life and those around me, I noticed that almost everyone I run into has some form of insecurity that they battle with. I believe the music I create fosters security and encourages those that hear it to embrace what makes them different and to find the beauty within their situation," says Barthe.

A performer as well as a gifted songwriter, Barthe is already a wellrounded success story at just 23 years old. Barthe's experiences traveling the world, attending St. John's University, and being raised in a multicultural home provided her with the unique and diverse view of the world that she now applies to her music. She has proven that she can take any genre or style of music put in her path and turn it into a hit, and in doing so, change the industry's expectation of what a pop song can and should be.
