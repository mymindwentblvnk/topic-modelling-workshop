There are multiple artists known by the name Tellurian.

Tellurian was a short-lived obscure early metal band from Buckinghamshire, UK formed in 1980. They had rather heavy sound for the early 80s combining brooding Black Sabbath/Witchfinder General-style doom metal with delicious nwobhm guitarwork and with considerable songwriting skill. Tellurian was comprised of Steve Cowerd on vocals, Richard Haines (guitar), Jon Newport (bass) and Dave White (drums). They only wrote about  a dozen songs contributing two tracks for the compilation of obscure local scene titled "The Whinging Album: Clutching At Straws" in 1982. These songs were re-released in 2006 by Zerlinda Records as a handnumbered limited edition of 500 copies "Reborn"/"Trojan Journey" 7-inch. Tellurian broke up in 1983, the rest of their material didn't survive through years.

Another Tellurian is the Hardcore Techno producer Michel Klaassen also known as Brainiac, Fearless, Leviathan, Micado, Michel Klaassen, Pulse. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tellurian">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
