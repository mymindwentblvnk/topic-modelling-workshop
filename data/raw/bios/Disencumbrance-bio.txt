Formed in 1992 when Joe Espinoza and Karel Fiferna formerly of Anguish teamed up with Richard Bruce and Clayton Humphrey formerly of True Repentance. Much toil ensued, and after roughly a year a diabolical force was unleashed upon the leopard-skin-tight wearing denizens of On The Rocks. More shows followed and in early 1994 the intrepid foursome recorded a 2 song demo featuring "Mark of Death" and "The Dead Are Among Us". Later that year Mr. Humphrey departed the band. Around Thanksgiving of 1994 the remaining members entered Sound Logic Studios to record a 3 song demo featuring Unholy Manifestations, Dimensions of Reality, and Suicide. Released in 1995 this recording is by far their best known work, still garnering positive reviews a decade later. Differing opinions in band direction led to Mr. Bruce departing the band in late 1995. Joe and Karel went on to form the fantastically brutal Detrimental in mid-1996. In 1998 the 3-song demo was featured in full on the Christian Grind/Thrash compilation Chords of the Grave. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Disencumbrance">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
