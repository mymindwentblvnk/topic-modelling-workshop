American technical thrash metal band from the Bay Area scene (San Francisco). Split up after recording two demos (1985, 1987), they have now re-united. In 2003 Real Metal Records released "Above the Ashes", a compilation/album that includes material from these two early demos. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ulysses+Siren">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
