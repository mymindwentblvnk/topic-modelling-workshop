They try to reanimate the spirit of the eighties, when music still was made for their own sake, when music meant rebellion and was an attitude, a life style. Inspired by bands from Iron Maiden to Metallica they found their own style somewhere between Heavy-, Thrash- and Powermetal.
They are fighting against the unoriginal music of today with it's endless repetions and face it with widespread compositions, melodic-high-energy vocals, countless guitar solos and outfits worthy to make the pure and “oldschool” fans become pretty nostalgic. 

Tune into their songs!!
