Destroying The Devoid was started by Craig Peters (Deeds of Flesh/Arkaik) in 2014. The idea behind the project was to be able to have creative freedom and take my songs to places I never would have in the past. The songs are dark, aggressive and very thematic. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Destroying+The+Devoid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
