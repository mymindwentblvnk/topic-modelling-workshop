Stained Glory was born on 2008 as a counter proposal to the local tendencies, not wanting to being categorized into any metal subgenre; taking into account that every band member presents influences that come from Johnny Cash to Pantera and from Alice in Chains to Lamb of God, presenting a unique sound that shows the world as the band sees it; a world without enough character to face situations that define a society giving the band the name of Stained Glory.

In early 2009 Stained Glory reaches its final line up with Sergio Osorio (Vocals), Carlos Escobar (Guitars) Francisco Sarmiento (Guitars) John Jairo Villaquiran (Bass) and Juan Andres Angulo (drums). In September 2009 Stained Glory Released its first demo called Freedoom that summarizes the band's essence in four well balanced songs, receiving big acceptance from the public.

This consolidates the band as one of the strongest exponents in Colombia's metal scene.
