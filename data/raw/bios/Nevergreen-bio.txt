1. Hungarian dark/gothic metal band formed in 1994 in Subotica (Serbia). Nevergreen released 7 full-length albums so far and one double live, most of their songs having Hungarian lyrics. Between 2004 and 2006 the band was on hold, because the members were concentrating on their projects (Green Division & Amok). But now, with new members along Bob Macura bassist-vocalist and Miklos Matlari keyboardist the band reunited and the new album is available since April 30 2007, titled "Eros, mint a halal".
They played at the biggest festivals in Hungary and Romania, right before Anathema, Paradise Lost, Deathstars and after Apocalyptica.
