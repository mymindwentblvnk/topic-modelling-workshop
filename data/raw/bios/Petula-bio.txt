Petula takes pleasure in making mistakes. He loves missing out. And he makes his guitar, assorted loops and rhythmic sound become songs. Inbetween lo-fi kitsch and friendly rage they go searching, looking for ends to their means.

An active part of post and indie rock bands Kate Mosh and SDNMT, this Mr Petula is about reluctance and about the slow and shaky exploration of possible futures and pasts. But what it all comes down to, time and again: Endings, farewells, pain and truth. Sounds good, doesn't it?

"A confident and desperate man knows how to create high-pitched frailty, cruelty almost, as it touches you where the scab fell off only recently, delicate and touchy places."
