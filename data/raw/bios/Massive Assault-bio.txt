Diesel truck grinding guitar sound, pounding drums, supercharged bass and aggressive vocals are merged into the band called Massive Assault.
Their music is a perfect mix of "early nineties" Death Metal & D-beat/Crust with Hardcore Punk energie.

Their latest release, 'Mortar'  displays the ]band in ultimate shape.

This Dutch band is around sinds 2003 and known for their impressive guitarsound, energetic live performances and musical & composing skills.

...Massive Assaults musical style will truly ravish those who like Entombed 's ' Left Hand Path', Dismember's 'Like an Ever Flowing Stream', Obituary's Slowly we Rot and Bolt Thrower's 'War Master'.
But will also appeal to those who are into crustpunk[/tag, thrash metal and hardcore.

Crank up the volume to the max when you're listening to Massive Assault!
