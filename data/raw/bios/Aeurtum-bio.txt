Aeurtum formed in 2010 as a 2 man project between Jon Collins and Brad Thomas, and released a 4 track demo in early 2011 under the title "Within This Enervation", before the project ended abruptly and the pair went separate ways to pursue other musical ventures.

During time playing in a different band, Jon began writing new material for the project. After leaving the other band late 2012, he then began work full-time on Aeurtum as a solo project, laying the foundations for what is now simply dubbed as "The Fall", an album described as "a great and absorbing album," (Seb Di Gatto, Mayfair Mallzine) and "Atmospheric, brutal and yet also almost unfathomably beautiful" (Phillip Stiles, Sonic Abuse).

November 2014 saw the release of Aeurtums sophomore album, "The Depths Of Which These Roots Do Bind". Ushering in a much darker sound, the album is a huge step forward to Aeurtum defining their own path in the doom/death metal genre.

"The Fall" and "The Depths Of Which These Roots Do Bind" are OUT NOW! 

The name Aeurtum (A-yer-tum) is inspired by the latin Aeternum (forever âˆž) and the modern day Autumn.
