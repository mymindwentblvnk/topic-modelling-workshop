1) Pneumonia was formed in 2003 in Częstochowa (Poland). The goal of the project is to create musician style joining different genres from Hardcore to Death Metal. The current line-up is:

Wojciech "Belfegor" Zalewski - guitar, vocals, music; 
Adrian "Marian" Olczyk - bass, vocals, lyrics;
Paweł "Kojot" Borecki - drums.

2) Crossover band, this time more Hardcore oriented.They lasted few years from 1988 and 1992, and also left us without any proper studio work.Just few DIY recordings, a testimony that Pneumonia was also a band that left a mark in the Pula Rock scene.
