Common Rider was formed in 1999 in California by Jesse Michaels (guitar, vocals), Mass Giorgini (bass), and Dan Lumley (drums). They were a ska band on a much softer note than that of Michaels' first group Operation Ivy, but still contained the same amount of energy and passion. They released two full-length albums and one EP. Last Wave Rockers was released in 1999 on Lookout! Records. Thief In a Sleeping Town EP was also released on Lookout! Records in 2001. The band released This Is Unity Music on Hopeless Records in 2002. In 2002, the band toured the US extensively, including the 2002 Plea For Peace tour, sponsored by Asian Man Records. On the tour, Phillip Hill (from the Teen Idols and also a major contributor on the album This is Unity Music) and Joe Mizzi (from Metro Detroit and also a guest vocalist on the album This Is Unity Music) played guitar for the band. A new EP (April 2005), split with Against All Authority, has been released containing outtakes from 2002's This Is Unity Music.

They broke up in 2003 mainly because of the want to pursue other opportunities. Dan Lumley officially retired from music at that time as well. Mass still remains in Squirtgun. In 2008, Jesse began a new band called Classics of Love. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Common+Rider">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
