Insane Prophecy is a Black Metal band from Guwahati, India formed in 2009.

Formed back in 2008 by Ifty (Drums) and Parvez (Former vocalist), Insane Prophecy defined its music as a Death/Grind Metal band. With five members in the band, it played its first gig in the Assam Engineering College’s annual rock fest – Pyrokinesis ’08, and made it to the finals. At that time, it played stuffs from Napalm Death and their then original numbers – ‘War Cry’, ‘Resurrection’ and ‘Rape of Democracy’. Unfortunately, after a couple of months, the band had to split ways to pursue higher education which resulted in the exit of its guitarist and bassist. After a hiatus of two months, the band reformed with Xulfi on bass, Bikash on guitars and Abhishek on keyboards. With this new line-up being heavily influenced by some Symphonic Black Metal acts like Dimmu Borgir, Cradle of Filth, etc, the band changed its genre to Symphonic Black Metal covering songs from the respective bands. Then there a time came when Parvez and Abhishek walked out from the band and with their exit, Insane Prophecy fluctuated from Symphonic Black Metal to Black Metal and Valefar joined in on vocals. On basis of its new sound, i.e, Black Metal, Insane Prophecy recorded its first single – ‘Blasphemy ov a Diabolic’. Recently, Valefar quit the band, which led Insane Prophecy to be a three-piece outfit with Ifty doing the Vocal & Drum duties and Xulfi & Bikash on their respective places. Insane Prophecy is now busy making more original stuffs for an upcoming E.P. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Insane+Prophecy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
