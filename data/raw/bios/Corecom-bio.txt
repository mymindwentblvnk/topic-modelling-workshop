Corecom is a band from the Bulgarian capital, started in the summer of 2011, which melts thrash, groove & sludge metal in an explosive and harsh mixture. The unique sound of CORECOM is forged by remarkably powerful vocals built on a background of sludgy contrast tempos, extremely expressive on stage.
The band themes and lyrics often concern social topics like human brutality, pollution, self-abuse & degradation.
Corecom started as a side project of the drummer Elenko Petrov and his mate the guitarist Plamen Bayraktarski and become a seriously addictive occupation with the recruiting of the bassist Miroslav Videnov and the vocalist / producer Dimitar “Dido” Georgiev. All members are well known from other Bulgarian bands (KPD-0, Reactija, The Alien Jackals, Der Hunds, ITSI, Alien Industry, All Of Us, Osil Amuk, Rocco E Freddy, Sub Zero Farm…) for the last 15 years.
The story of band’s name is linked to a trademark brand store “CORECOM” which was the only place where Bulgarians could find and buy western European products during the communistic period of the country (1944 - 1989). Anyone purchasing goods at “CORECOM” but not authorized possess foreign currency was at risk of investigation by communistic State security.
In 2013 CORECOM released a self-titled EP with 3 songs in and immediately after that started work on their first full length album (titled “Crawling Under The Heavy Foot Of Addiction”) which was released in the 1-st of November 2014 - 10 astonishing tracks, including an industrial metal remix of song from the EP, made by the Bulgaria’s pioneer in the genre ZZ Minev from Alien Industry.
