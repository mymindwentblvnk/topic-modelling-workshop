If you’re a collector of old school funk, this is for you. Produced by Dr. Cecil Hale and Cold Fire’s only released album. Their second album was being recorded when the group broke up.  The members of the band  were Ron Rillera the main songwriter/arranger on keyboards, Michael Loatman on guitars, Warren Anthony Petty on bass, Douglas Stevens on trombone, Jimmie Weaver on sax, Roland Jennings on trumpet, William "BJ" Reese on lead vocals, and Ray Towns, Jr. on drums.  All members sang vocals on the album with Loatman, Petty, and Towns, Jr., sharing lead vocals on various cuts.  William "BJ" Reese was the main lead singer heard throughout the album.  The opening cut, the funky H.F.R.S. (Hustlin’, Freakin’, Rockin’, Streakin’) is a killer track and the main reason for it being on this list. The album also includes Patrice Rushen on keyboards, Nathan East on bass and once Crusaders drummer Ndugu Chancler.  All keyboard solos were performed by Ron Rillera,  All guitar solos were performed by Michael Loatman.  All bass solos were performed by Warren Anthony Petty.  "Daydreaming" soprano sax solo was performed by Jimmie Weaver.  The group was a talented self-contained act with the "guest" artists included for "name" recognition value. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cold+Fire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
