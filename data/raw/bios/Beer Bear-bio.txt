Beer Bear is a Russian Folk metal band formed in 2008 and disbanded in 2013. It was founded by bassist and vocalist Kirill Nikeyev aka Sventoyar. 

Beer Bear released two albums with mostly humorous folk fantasy lyrics about sentient Russian bears who fight, drink, and feast, although some songs were more serious. For their lyrics and genre, they were often compared to Finntroll. While most songs are in Russian, a couple of songs on their second album were in Ukrainian and one in Polish. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beer+Bear">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
