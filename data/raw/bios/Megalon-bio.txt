Tommy Gunn aka Megalon is a Hip Hop artist from NY, USA

Megalon is one of the original Monsta Island Czars emcee's even going back to when he was part of Bobbito's Fondle Em' label way back when (he also busted large on Doom's classic plastic 'Greenbacks'). 'Penny For Your Thoughts' is his debut album, a twenty two track journey into the darkened heavy heavy sound of the NY underground, lyrically deep and intense like we love - hate & love in the mix. Full dope production by the man X-Ray who even guest raps on a couple of tracks. There's no love for Doom here though that's no reason to ignore this incredible talent who is currently serving time at the Five Points Correctional Facility in NY.
