Old Thunder was conceptualized sometime in late 2012/early 2013. After writing music under a different project name for several years, some life events brought about a new creative spark and maturity. With the change in sound came a change in name. "Old Thunder" is lifted from Melville's novel Moby Dick and is an homage to the enduring spirit of creativity.

The EP Slings & Arrows was recorded in June 2014 and was released independently in September. More songs are currently being written, and studio time is tentatively scheduled for December 2014.
