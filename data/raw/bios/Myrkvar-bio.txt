Myrkvar is storming the Dutch and international metalstages since 2004 with their energetic folk/viking metal. The characteristic sound of the bands is best described as a mix between merry folk and rapid energetic guitar-riffs with banging drums. The fierce screams and grunts are alternated with clean vocals which creates a real folk-atmosphere. During their gigs Myrkvar has shared the stage with famous bands like Turisas, Korpiklaani, Finntroll, Heidevolk, Arkona, Thyrfing, and Månegarm.

After several demos Myrkvar released their debut-album Als een woeste Horde in 2008, and many live shows followed. In 2010 the band began working on a second full album, a concept album with stories about Ragnarok, inspired by Nordic Mythology as found in the Edda. The album As en Bloed was released in 2012; its Dutch title translates into "Ash and Blood", but also "Blood of the Æsir" (asenbloed). After some gigs in the Netherlands, Germany and France - with an awesome show at Cernunnons Pagan Fest being one of the highlights - the band started recording again. In december 2016 their newest output Plunder & Brand saw the light of day.
