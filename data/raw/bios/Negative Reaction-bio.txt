There are two groups that have used the name Negative Reaction. One is an Australian Industrial/Experimental group that formed in 1978. The other is a sludge/doom metal band originally from New York, USA, but relocated to West Virginia.  They formed in 1990.

The sludge/doom metal group's biography:
Ken-E Bones - Vocals, Guitars (Orange 120 OD Feedback), Native American Flute
Trey Crane - Bass
Kevin King - Drums

Negative Reaction is a part of the Sludge/Doom metal scene. NR uses feedback as a hammer and the guitars tuned to A as the stake. Don't be alarmed though, this band writes songs with feeling and heart to match creativity and give the listener one hell of a time. They can tear through a fast number as well as a slow one, which will make you think you're listening to a combination of Grief, Black Sabbath and Napalm Death. Negative Reaction released their first seven inch in 1993 and are still going strong.
