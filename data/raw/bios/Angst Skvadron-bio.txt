Formed in 2008 in Norway, Angst Skvadron is the brainchild of Norwegian musician T. Nefas, known for his work in Urgehal, Kvist, In Lingua Mortua, Vulture Lord and Beastcraft, among others. Angst Skvadron is by far his most progressive project to date. 'Flukt' melds '90s black metal with '70s prog rock/metal. Disharmonic, melancholic, misanthropic and insane. Ably assisted by master keyboardist Lars Froislie (Wobbler, In Lingua Mortua, Endezzma, ex-White Willow).
