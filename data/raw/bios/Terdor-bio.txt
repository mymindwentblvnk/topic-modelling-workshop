BIOGRAPHY:
Terdor is a Dutch Black Metal band founded in 2005. The line-up has been, is and always will be just Elshschappij Tovenaere (instruments) and Lafawijn (vocals). During the early years of Terdor our songs were focussed on war themes, hence our slogans, “No Peace for our time!” and “It’s not just music with war lyrics but the war within the music!”, that we still use today on our releases. During 2005 our first demo, called “The combat action of 5 October 1944”, was released by my own label Lafawijn Records (RIP) as 152 tapes. In 2007 this demo is re-released by War Flaggelation Records from Portugal as 300 tapes and by Wolfsvuur Records from The Netherlands as 100 tapes and 48 CD-Rs bringing the total amount of this release at 600 copies. Of note, all editions have different artwork. During the years after the release of our first demo we worked hard on new songs for the first full length album. This album named “Axis Panzerzug anno November 1942” was finally unleashed in 2008 by Thor’s Hammer Records from France as 500 CDs and by Krieg Distro & Productions from Brasil as 333 tapes. Almost simultaneously a split album with Gheestenland was released by Wolfsvuur records as 250 tapes. In 2010 the war inspired period of Terdor was finished with the release of the 7” EP named “No peace for our time!” by Negra Nit Distro from Spain, limited to 525 copies. With a different approach, both lyrically and musically we started working on our second full length album, titled “Levi”. This album was released as a co-release by Negra Nit Distro and Stunde Des Ideals from Germany as 1000 CDs and 250 digi-CDs. Our latest album, titled “Levi II” was released in 2013 by Pesttanz Klangschmiede and Hass Weg Productions from Germany and France as a CD (1000 copies) and LP (474 copies).
