Under The Scythe is a deathcore band that formed in Yaroslavl, Russia in July 2008. Its members came from the groups 'Scythe', 'Fourth Dimension', and 'Mind Eclipse'. At that time they made their first demo tape and sometime later published it in the form of an EP release. It received lots of positive reviews on the Internet. During this time the group was also working to create new material and concert performances. Over the last few years, Under The Scythe has given many successful concerts, including performances with 'Despised Icon' (Canada) and 'Horse The Band' (USA). In late 2009, Under The Scythe released their debut full-length album entitled «Истина в Тебе» which translates to 'The Truth Inside You'. It was released through an independent Russia label 'Gigawatt Music'.
