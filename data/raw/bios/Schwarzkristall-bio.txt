Formed in 2005 in the deep crypts of Herzogenburg in Austria, SCHWARZKRISTALL is an enigmatic black metal band that centralizes the dark energies of all existence and splits them into deep atmospheric auras.  Their music is not the typical fast and furious Black Metal thrashings - over in an instant.  The tracks are long - melding doom, serene acoustic introspection and terrifying ferocity to lead you to another world.  SCHWARZKRISTALL’s music is a gate to a higher dimension.  

SCHWARZKRISTALL released their first demo (CD/MC) at the start of 2009 and received an overwhelmingly positive response from the metal underground.  The Demo sold out in a very short time, and many who heard it assumed it to be a debut album because of the production qualities, and the playing time of 48 minutes.  

Demo Track List:
01 Und Es Begann
02 Schwarzkristallnacht
03 Begräbnis Des Lichts
04 Gefrierpunkt

Members:
Noctar (Guitar, Vocals)
Dakryor (Guitar)
Despectus (Drums)
Abyssus (Bass)

Work is now well under way on the first full-length album, and SCHWARZKRISTALL will begin to look for a label.
