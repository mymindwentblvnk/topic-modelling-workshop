provocateur (pr..k'uh-tûr) n. a secret agent who incites suspected persons to commit illegal acts [syn: agent provocateur.] [French: provocateur, instigator.]

There are multiple artists known as Provocateur:

1. Provocateur is Boston's premiere electro-pop band, comprised of the unlikely combination of jazz-folk singer/songwriter Matthew Connor, and Stacia Tucker, electro mastermind and member of Boston based acts Infrastructure and mindFIELD.

Matthew is an Aries, prone to fierce, albeit productive, mood swings and hyperbolic tendencies. A former opera singer turned contemporary songwriter, he found his way from the rural Southland to Boston in search of fame, designer clothing, and whiskey.

Stacia is a mild-mannered Scorpio who spends her days playing with robots and her nights playing with analog synthesizers and operating heavy machinery. She has extensive remix experience and recently contributed the first track on Mindless Self Indulgence’s Straight to Video Remixes single, which landed at 7 on Billboard’s year-end dance singles chart for 2006 (beating out Beyonce and Goldfrapp). When she is not busy dominating the charts, she enjoys veggie tacos, sharks, and zombies.

Matthew and Stacia are joined on stage by Adam 'Honey Smacks' Hodges on bass and Chris Lampner rockin the drums.

These eclectic talents combine to form Provocateur, a sound that is entirely unique yet instantly accessible, melodic yet noisy, unapologetically sexual, slyly humorous, and above all consistently danceable. Provocateur: the name says it all. 

2. Provocateur is an industrial metal act from Auckland, New Zealand. Their Libertine EP is set for release soon.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Provocateur">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
