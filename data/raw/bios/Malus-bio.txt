1. Malus is a Black Metal band from RÃ¶srath, Germany in 2001. All instruments and vocals are done by Wargrath, who is also a member of Odium Immortalis and Somnium Mortuum. He also runs Storms Productions.

The band's lyrical themes center on the supremacy of nature over mankind, and the sound varies from very raw, hard black metal to very atmospheric, dark toned symphony.

Malus has four demos, three of which were created all in the year of 2002. The only full length album is Creation of Death, which was released in 2003.
