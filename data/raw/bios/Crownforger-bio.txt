Crownforger was formed in 2005 by keyboardist Heikkinen, vocalist/guitarist Salonen, Marjakoski, Toppila and Blom. This bunch of friends wanted to play together some sort of melodic metal, inspired by many Finnish groups. It was spring 2006 when we started to work out our own songs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 In late 2006 Crownforger got a chance to record three songs in a demo studio for free. The line-up was Moilanen, Marjakoski, Kampura, Heikkinen, Toppila and Blom. At the same year we played our first gig at Malmi, Helsinki. Few other shows were played as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   In summer 2007 Crownforger decided to record our second demo tape, which is now known as In His Crypt. Shortly after that Heikkinen left the band and later Kampura was off too. He was replaced by Haimilahti, but the band made a decision to move on without keyboardist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The year 2008 started with rehelsals and new songs were ready to bang some heads. In January Kampura made his return to band and replaced Haimilahti as a second guitarist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crownforger">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
