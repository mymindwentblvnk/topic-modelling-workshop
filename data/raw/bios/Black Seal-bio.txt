"Mixing noirish atmospheric post-rock, reverberating punk, sluggish stoner sludge pacing, and early metal riffing, the Lake Worth trio of Astaroth Crowley, Robb Erwin, and Tom Beals cohesively meshes all the music thatâ€™s likely sitting in their record collection."
 
- William Alton, Beached Miami, "Top 50 South Florida Songs of 2012"
 

"There is no mumbling from Black Seal behind a curtain of feedback and reverb; vocals are shouted and at times screamed with zealous clarity over the strained grind of an overdriven guitar." 

- Brennan Forsyth, Broward-Palm Beach New Times
 

"Its punk-rock roots, the blues, and garage psychedelic rock inform its current sound, as do bands like Butthole Surfers and Motorhead . . . Their music fuses genres, creating something enveloping and attractive, something originally familiar." 

- Liz Tracy, County Grind - New Times Broward-Palm Beach Music
 

"This band is all things 'Heavy Planet'. They bring doom, sludge, stoner metal, and psychedelia. Seriously, miss this and you miss our mission." 

- Seth Grennan, Heavy Planet
