DBB (Drive-By Bukkake) is a revoltingly fun, thrash / grind / death metal band based out of Worcester, MA USA. DBB are heavily influenced by Andrew WK, SOD, Nails, Power Trip, Suffocation, pro wrestling, and dumb movie/tv samples (which they use throughout their songs). “It’s an experience to hear them live, a show full of crunchy comedic memories” quoted Vanyaland.com.

DBB’s summer 2022 album “Bastards of Slime” was engineered at Sonic Titan Studios by Anthony Medaglia (Atheist) and was mastered by Tim Brault (Hivesmasher). Since 2005, DBB have also released multiple full-length albums as well a 90’s punk covers EP “Spunk-O-Rama”.

Formed in 2005, DBB have played throughout the US and Canada, including shows with Party Cannon, Parasitic Ejaculation, Meek is Murder, Eat the Turnbuckle, Chained to the Dead, Dysentery, Anal Cunt, The Summoned, and more. DBB also performed at the 2018 edition of RPM Fest and will be playing extensively beyond 2022 to promote their album “Bastards of Slime”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Drive-By+Bukkake">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
