Gosforth is a black metal band from Milan, Italy. Forming the band in 1997 E.A. Zorath decided to pay his tribute to the old extreme black metal scene, starting a band called Elghard with M.L. (guitar) and C. Zorath (drums). The first songs were written but, before the band entered the studio for the 1st recording, M.L. left them. 1999 After lots of guitarists changes, E.A. Zorath decided to play both guitar and bass himself, and when Luxitan joined the band the old songs were re-arranged. From an idea of Luxitan the band name turned into Gosforth.
