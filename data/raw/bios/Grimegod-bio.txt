Grimegod was born in 1991, in Arad (Romania). The story starts in the autumn of 1991, when Tibor (vocals) and Hoit (guitars) created Grimegod. Three years later, the first demo tape was recorded and was sold in over 500 copies. The demo is called "Never Come Back" and because of it Grimegod was considered the first doom-death Romanian band. Line-up on "Never Come Back": Tibor K. - vocals, Aniela F. - female vocals, Hoit C. - guitar, Do B. - guitar, Ady L. - bass, Andy A. - keyboards and Gaby F. - drums. The first album, "Under The Sad And Silent Sky", was recorded one year later, at Pacific Home Studio, and was produced by Grimegod & Theo B. The band gets the 3rd position in Top Ten Romanian new-comers of Heavy Metal Magazine (the oldest and most popular magazine in Romania). This first album was sold in about 900 copies (the tape is sold out now). Line-up on Under the Sad and Silent Sky : Tibor K. - vocals, Aniela F. - female vocals, Hoit C. - guitar, Do B. - guitar, Danny V. - bass, Ciungu D. - keyboards and Gaby F. - drums.

Starting with the second album, Dreamside Of Me, Grimegod signs a deal with Bestial Records (first and most respectable Romanian metal label). This album was recorded again at Pacific Home Studio, in 1996; it was produced by Grimegod and released in 1997 by the above mentioned record company. This one was the best sold album (1500 copies - sold out now). According to Heavy Metal Magazine annual top, the band became "the best Romanian act on 1997", and "Dreamside Of Me" is "the best album", in the same top. The music from this album is pessimistic, violent but also melodious, in the same time. The feeling is the meaning of life... Line-up: Tibor K. - vocal, Hoit C. - guitar, Tilo A. - guitar, Danny V. - bass, Dan "Polymoog" S. (Pacific, Compact B., etc.) - keyboards and Dolly I. - drums. In 1998, at Red Moon Studio, Grimegod recorded "The Dark Side - Pain In Another Dimension" (the 3rd album of the band and the second released under Bestial Records). This was an so called "experimental album", because a drum machine and a computer were used, and the songs were the remixed versions of the best parts from the previous albums. The line-up on this album is: Tibor K. - vocal & programing, Hoit C. - guitar & programing, Tilo A. - guitar.

The 4th and the last album so far is called "With Broken Wings" and it’s still available in Bestial Records mail order. The recording took place at Grimegod Studio in 2000 and the album is produced by the band itself. We only can tell you that the sound is better than ever, and the music is more violent, maybe preparing the next album, which will be a true death metal one. Starting with 2001 Grimegod was invited to take part in some major events and festivals. We played a few times in Hungary (on the same stage with Sear Bliss – Nightbreed Festival 2001), we were invited as opening band for Mystic Circle in February 2004, in Bucharest and in September 2006 Grimegod performed in front of 1900 people as opening band for Tiamat (in Bucharest/Romania, once again). This year, 2007, a new chapter in our band's history will arise. A new album, new people, another way of life, another style. You can find on our MySpace the very first single, "Cosmar prefabricat". In January 2007 former member Hoit has left the band. The reason behind this decision was a personal one. Same time Bogdan, the bass player, left the band as well... Tibor is taking the guitar parts and the bass is played by an old friend of the band, Oribilu. Now the band is working to a series of new songs (agressive, melodic and straight death metal) for the upcoming and long awaited 5th album. Some of these songs were performed live for the first time at Metal Healing Festival (22th of July, 2007), where Grimegod played live for the first time in Greece, as opening band for Pentagram and Destruction. For the first time the lyrics are fully in Romanian language.
In 2007 Hoit (guitar) decides to leave the band leaving Tibor the only founding member in the band. Grimegod performs that year in Greece at Metal Healing festival on the same stage with Destruction, The Haunted and Pentagram. In 2008, Grimegod performs in a mini-tour with Crossover ( Greece ) and Krepuskul (Ro). During the summer of 2008 the band opens the Crematory and Lake of Tears concerts. In the same year Grimegod begins the recording for the new “Roads” album.

Recently, in 2009 Hoit (guitar) rejoins the band and celebrating 18 years of existence, the band starts an anniversary tour. This same year the first album “Under the Sad and Silent Sky” is re-mastered but never produced. In 2010 the anniversary tour continues until Hoit (guitar) and Ted (drums) leave the band. Their place is filled with success by Alex (drums) and Jet (guitar).

In 2011, the band finishes recording the album "Wrong Roads". Vartan (drums) took over the place of Alex. Since then, the band had several concerts in this new arrangement, participating in Romania's finals for Global Battle of the Bands. At the start of 2012, Jetu (guitar) left the band, Gabi taking over the rhythm guitar parts.
In about 20 years of intense activity, Grimegod has changed a lot of members – the band want to thank all of them for the support. The present line-up is: Tibor K. – vocals and guitar, Tilo  - guitar, Ovidiu C. "Oribilu" - bass, Gabriel Hesz - guitar and Vartan Garabedian– drums.

Kati Tibor "Tubi" (vocals,guitar)
