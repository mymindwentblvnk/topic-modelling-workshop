ANGIS (Members: Alenas Babrauskas - vocals, Tadas Petrokas - guitar, backing vocals, Darius Laurinavičius - guitar, angry vocals, Laurynas Arminas "Bėska" – bass, Gytis Nėnius "Kingas" – drums) exists from 1996 and has been searching for new ways of expression in metal music ever since. Having started with doom and death metal, it later changed its style several times and finally stopped at pagan metal. The music of the band is enriched by pagan moods, and the texts of songs often picture the historical past of Lithuania, when it was still a pagan country. Lately the line-up of the band changed and now the style of ANGIS is described as melodic metal.
