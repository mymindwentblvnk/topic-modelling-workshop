Neuraxis was formed in 1994 in Montreal, Canada.

Having released 6 full lengths (Imagery, A Passage Into Forlorn, Truth Beyond.. , Trilateral Progression, The Thin Line Between, Asylon) Neuraxis have created a very unique style combining sheer brutality with a melodic and progressive edge. 

Imagery was more of a death/grind album, while A Passage Into Forlorn (2001) introduced a more melodic and progressive side of extreme metal. And with Truth Beyond…(2002), Neuraxis raised the bar with a dizzying amount of brutality, melody and technicality. All 3 albums were released in Canada (Galy Rec), USA (Willowtip Rec) and Europe (Earache Rec). 

In 2005 Neuraxis remain as progressive and vital as ever with their brand new full length, Trilateral Progression. Since Truth Beyond, the band's songwriting has matured to the point of Atheist-like complexity,  while maintaining a triumphant melodic edge that baffles and lays waste to most of their contemporaries. 

Trilateral Progression stands tall as an articulate model for challenging technical death metal that rejects commercial trends and successfully balances a majestic sense of melody with go-for-the-throat aggression.
