This band was formed in 1998 under the name "Thirsty for Blood." We played numerous gigs in Auburn, Sacramento, and San Francisco. Our stage show consisted of fire, metal, and of course lots of blood. In 2000 we put out a 5 song demo cassette limited to 50 copies. We had a few member changes and we changed the name to "Shrine Of Scars." 

After a six month hiatus and some more member changes we released "Deathbed for a Weakening Spirit". In 2003 Disfigured Records released "Violence Is The Answer", which received many great reviews worldwide. We took another break so certain members could have kids... or mental breakdowns. Then in 2007 we independently release our third recording, a 5 song E.P. "The Knife" - 

 S.O.S. is not trying to be the fastest, most brutal or extreme band. We are strictly committed to playing metal in the vein we would like to hear it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shrine+of+Scars">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
