Liquid Society plays melodic, female fronted metal. The band aims to create something own and unique by combining different styles of metal music. At the moment Liquid Society resides in South-Ostrobothnia, Finland, mainly in Seinäjoki and Vaasa. The band was formed in 2007 but with current line-up it has been active since autumn 2008, because the band faced a change of vocalist. The new vocalist didn’t have much experience of singing in a metal band. Nevertheless, due to the new vocalist Liquid Society’s songs gained a totally new edge and the overall sound of the band improved. Since the new line-up seemed to work out very well Liquid Society decided to produce a demo and bring the band and its music forth actively. The first demo was made and produced completely by the band itself (only mastering and copying was made at Studio57). The demo was recorded at the band’s training facilities and in Mika’s flat. The main goal of Liquid Society is of course to get a record deal and make lots of performances. The most important thing for the band right now is to get feedback and to develop the music. All members of the band look positively into the future and are ambitious regarding this project.
