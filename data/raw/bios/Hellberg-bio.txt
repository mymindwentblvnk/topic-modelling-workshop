Jonathan Hellberg has always been hungry to prove his musical prowess to the world. Hailing from Stockholm, Hellberg first began his musical knack in the form of one-man-shows for his family on makeshift instruments. By the age of 13, he was introduced to the world of producing and DJ culture through a school friend who was experimenting with mashups. From that discovery, Hellberg began to tinker on FL Studio, seeing how far he could push himself. Creating a slew of both hip hop beats and house tracks, Hellberg eventually turned to honing his craft in the dance music world.

Fast forward to today, Hellberg has become a valued family member of Monstercat by embodying everything the label is about: fearless experimentation, holding himself to a standard of perfection, and a disregard for the status quo. The future is nothing if not extremely promising for Hellberg. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hellberg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
