Their style can be described as harder punk or softer grindcore, but the most appropriate name would be probably "shit metal". 

This project was born in Pilsen, Czech Republic (yes, the capital of beer :-) ) in December of 2000. Members are (or were, since this is a one-time project) Lord Kopromaster the Great, Lord Hovnocuc and Kopro Kaya. Lyrics are inspired by coprophagy (litteraly "eating shit"). They made only one album, named "7%" since there statistically is circa 7% of population perverted this way.

If you want to compare this music to something, you can look for the bands "Shat", "Bathtub Shitter", "Defecation" and "Bloody Diarrhoea". 

However, quality of their records (can be downloaded for free at http://kopromasters.cernylord.cz/#KMS_MP3) is quite low - as it usually is, when talking about underground - and they sing in Czech, so that if you don't speak Czech, you'll probably miss the point, but if you want to try it anyway - YOU'RE WELCOME. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kopromasters">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
