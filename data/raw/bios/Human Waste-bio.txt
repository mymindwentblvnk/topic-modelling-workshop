Tjere are at least four bands with this name:

1) Crust from Ã–stersund, Sweden
2) Spanish Death Metal band  https://archive.org/details/humanwastehumanwaste
3) Australian 80's hardcore band.
4) Oakland grindcore band.

1) This band started back in the year 1998. Four low-life suckers who had nothing to do in their spare time except for drinking and play music started to jam on a youth recreation centre. The band have changed members more often then they change underwears. But todays line-up have been the same for some years now. The first seven inches was pretty boring straight-up forward scandi-crust, and they were often compared to Skitsystem in zine-reviews. Today they have created thier own sound, in a sweet combination between crust and rock n roll. Human Waste have released to many records and done to few conserts. But it's not that easy when all of the members live in different cites all over across Sweden. It's not that hard to guess that this band don't rehersal that often. It's fucking unbelievable that they did the european "slusk tour" for five weeks in the end of 2004. They have talked about recording an LP for a long time now, and who knows...when you least expect it it might be released... 

2) Spanish death metal band formed in 1990. Human Waste featured the themes 'So is death', 'The men and their lives' and 'The almighty protozoon' in the "Death Metal Party" Compilation (PSM Music, 1995). Another bands featured were Pulmons Negres, Traste, Mortal Mutilation, Obscure (Esp), Corrupt Soul, Karne de Zerdo and Necropsy (Esp).

3) Australian 80's hardcore band. Released a demo in '86. Additional information is scarce.

4) Short-lived Oakland grindcore act. Released 2 splits, a small handful of EPs and demos and called it quits in Aug '12.
