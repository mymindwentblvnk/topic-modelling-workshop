2) Formed in 2004, After the Sun began writing songs and playing small local shows, slowly gaining a fan base along the way. Several line-up changes along the years have brought After the Sun to a new level of song writing/structuring as well as enhanced live performances. With it's current line-up, the band combines many genres such as metal, harcdore, and punk into their songs. Each member brings their own style and musical background to create what is their sound. Heavy intense riffs that lead to catchy sing along choruses depict After the Sun's approach to song writing.  This group using the moniker After The Sun is done being a band,  broken up in 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/After+the+Sun">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
