There are several bands with the name Serapis:

1)  A trip-hop  group. They released the album Serapis in 2003, and an extended version  Serapis extended in 2006.

2) Mixing doom, thrash, and metal, Serapis are as unique as they are volatile. Formed from the core members of My Surrender, the band has in one form another been active since the year 2000. These Memphis, TN natives advance forth with a blitzkrieg-like assault of thrashy riffs, an elephantine rhythm section and screeching vocals that occasionally simmer off into a few soaring harmonies. When these elements are combined with the groups claustrophobic and violent songwriting style, it's not long before a cathartic aural dementia soon sets in. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Serapis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
