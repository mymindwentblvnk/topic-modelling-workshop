A hallucinogenic waltz, an expressive temper tantrum. A heart wide open and eyes sewn shut. Einvera was formed in Los Angeles where each of the members met in music school. With completely different musical backgrounds Einvera has created something very refreshing and off the wall. With use of odd instrumentation and haunting folk passages as well as pounding drums and chest sinking melody they continue to give everything in a live show and well as recordings. Playing to very diverse crowds and mixed genre shows Einvera gives something that each person can see, honesty.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Einvera">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
