Biography:
The band was founded around March 07 by Domen, Ožbej, Rok and Bojan, who just wanted to play some old school thrash covers, but after the first band practice they already decided to do something bigger. They started to look for a vocalist and in a couple of weeks Alex showed up, and so the band was complete. With intense practicing they we're ready to record their first demo till the end of September and right shortly after that the calls for gigs came flying in. The guys already did around 20 gigs including a succesful appearance at MC 08. Practicing, working and playing at full speed they're looking for as many gigs as possible and a label to help them. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thraw">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
