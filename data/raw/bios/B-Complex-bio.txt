B-complex, real name Matia Lenická (formerly known as Matúš Lenický), is a producer hailing from Bratislava, Slovakia. 
Her first musical attempts began in 1996, at the age of twelve. A passion and fascination of music led her through many genres. Beginning with Hardcore, Trance, Psytrance, progressing though to experimenting with down tempo and Hip-Hop. 2001 she discovered the album ‘Clockwork’ by ‘Stakka and Skynet.’ Her journey with Drum and Bass music was born. 
Matia has a unique style, not trying to follow anyone but rather prefers to walk her own path. With potential growing - her sound becoming ever more definitive. 
She was discovered in November 2008 by Tony Colman of ‘Hospital Records’. They featured her soon to be debut hit ‘Beautiful Lies’ on the ‘London Electricity’ Podcast, later to be featured on the ‘Introducing’ BBC Radio1 show. After receiving a lot of attention from other producers, DJ’s and fans alike; ‘Beautiful Lies’ was released with great succession as an ‘A side’ on Hospital’s ‘Sick Music’ compilation album in June 2009, reaching the top 30 ‘iTunes UK Download Chart’ and making it into the top 5 ‘Beatport Drum and Bass Chart’. The tune soon became a major d&b hit, and is now considered classic among many. 

Soon after, her track ‘Three Dots’ also received play from Tony and High Contrast on Radio1. Forthcoming releases in line, a full DJ schedule, with her first UK show in September 2009 at London’s 'Hospitality @Matter'.

For many, her coming out as transgender was also such surprise. She promotes tolerance, understanding and defends the minorities, in her actions and in music too. Recent example being her tune 'Past lessons for the future', a free track featuring words of great czech actor and philosopher Jan Werich. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/B-Complex">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
