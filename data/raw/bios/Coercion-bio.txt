2) Coercion is a Romanian hardcore punk band

The band started out in '07, having the first show in may. It's mostly about some good old fashioned fast hardcore/punk music about... well about what most good old fashioned fast hardcore/punk music is about: social change, destroying the new world order, people who piss you off, drugs, nakedness and all that, straight outta the wild east. Demo was out back in '09 and the first LP will finally come to life in the fall of '11. So have fun and kill cops!
