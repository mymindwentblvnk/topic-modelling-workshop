SEE INFO FOR NIMROD FROM DKNY:

Nimrod, also known as Luis. these tracks are a collection of songs i made through the past several years. they aren't the best sounding songs but i think it's fine for what i had to work with. several songs were recorded with a laptop using adobe audition software. the beats are not produced by me, all are 'borrowed'. but as for actual content.., that's me, nimrod.

'how i like it' was a hit! inspiration can strike from anything, whether it be 'net hook-ups (believe, j.a.n.(just another night), doomed relationships (do you, platypus (i hate you), a lil ultra-violence (cholerik f.s., nobody come around), or the streets (meltdown, str8 outta dk). my blink-182 jacked instrumental track stands alone (life's so boring).
