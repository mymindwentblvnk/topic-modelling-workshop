Aeba are one of the first pioneers of the second generation of Black Metal in Germany. They were founded in 1992 and were named Eternal Suffer. In 1994 they renamed the bandname to Aeba. It's a buildup from the four archdemons Astaroth, Eurynome, Bael and Amducias who brought the Apocalypse. The lyrics are mostly satanic but the band insists that they are not a NSBM band and they don't want to be understood like that. 

The lineup AEBA today:

Isegrim - Vocals & Guitar
Schattensturm - Vocals & Guitar
Xsaahr - Guitar
Exul - Bass
Infernal Desaster - Drums
