A melodic black metal band from Narva, Estonia.

The band was founded in the year 2000. At the very beginning the band was called Fatal Silence. The idea of its creation belonged to Kryptos but he wasn’t a member of a band yet because around that time was playing guitar in another Death/Doom band Decadent. At times, Kryptos gave only some advice and visited their rehearsals with some kind of session member' role. So that’s why Devotus Regnum had only 2 people: Tanum and Fatal. Then Kryptos fully joined band in the year 2001 and took a still vacant place of vocalist and bass player. In the year 2003 Kurt VB (second guitarist) came to Devotus Regnum. There is also one out-of-stage member Asgartha, who is going to become the full rights' member in the nearest future. Her merit are some lyrics, translations, logo, design of covers and photography. Nowadays band consists of five members.

In the summer of 2007 they released their first full-length album Centuries Conversely.
