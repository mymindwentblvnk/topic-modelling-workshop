Music in its purest form is simple, emotional, and energetic. There is no need for musical odysseys with fifteen instruments and twenty solos. Music carries with it a feel, a pulse. Music is and will always be the ultimate art form.

In the summer of 2007, five dudes with this same philosophy came together to have fun, go crazy, and make music. Bringing their broad influences and different styles they blended them all to become what is now A World Without… hardcore done right.

He spent the next few hours on the phone with Logan Shermeyer, his friend and band mate in …And Her Name Was Vengeance, discussing what to do next. The consensus solution was to form a new band. During those conversations, one name kept popping up… Josh Mullen. With Josh on board, Logan recruited Todd Myers to play guitar. The last piece of the puzzle fell into place the next day when Travis Philyaw, ex-bassist and co-founder of …And Her Name Was Vengeance, called.
