The Prague-based Taliesyn, named for the semi-mythical Welsh bard and patron of wizards, got together in the late 90’s with the aim of taking up the best of the anglophone folk scene of the 60’s and 70’s -- namely the legendary British outfit Pentangle. Gradually, Taliesyn steered in the direction of an idiosyncratic folk-rock fusion.

The band draws heavily on the songwriting talents of the lead singer Jan Bicovsky, the echoes of Central European folklore in the songs by Vojtech Jindra and the arrangements by the bandleader Robert Fischmann. In 2000 and 2001, the demo disks titled “Taliesyn” and “Four Flavours” came out. The line-up then underwent some changes, including the adoption of a drum kit, as opposed to the persussion set used in the previous years, which ultimately led to a more vigorous sound, fusing elements of folk, Celtic music, Czech and Moravian folklore, jazz and rock. The instrumentation remains largely “traditional”, with staple instruments such as acoustic guitar, bouzouki, mandolin, flute and violin, later complemented by the electric colours of the Hammond organ and Fender Rhodes. The current line-up includes Adam Pospisil on the violin, Filip Benesovsky on the bass, and Michal Dolezal and Radim Chrobok behind the keyboards and the drums, respectively.

The band released their first CD "Southern Amnesia" in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Taliesyn">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
