Downcast Collision from The Hague & Rotterdam Area plays Modern Metal.

Heavy sounding songs infested with tight riffs and melody. The band was brought to life somewhere in 2012 and has since been enthusiastically working on catchy album material. Although the band is fairly young, its members are experienced musicians in the metal and rock music scene. Downcast Collision as of now is ready to sweep over the world like a plague of heaviness. 

Monica Janssen - Vocals & Bass
Peter van Toren - Drums
Casper van der Woord - Guitar
Geoffrey Maas - Guitar
