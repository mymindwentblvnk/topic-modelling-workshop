4) A canadian blues rock band.

Blackstone recorded its debut album in 1973, On the Line. The music critics found the first album less than pleasing, and soon group members Finley, Leishman, Hodgson, Sheppard, and Steinberg were all moving on to more lucrative projects. Weis and Fonfara tried to hang in there for a while longer with Blackstone, brining in some new blood to the group, like bassist John Prakash, singer Mike Stull, and drummer Penti "Whitey" Glan. The official end came in 1973, only a year after the band's creation.

Line-up:

John Finley (vocals),
Michael Fonfara (keyboards),
Peter Hodgson (bass),
Larry Leishman (vocals, guitar, harp),
Frank "Zeke" Sheppard (vocals, harp),
Richard Steinberg (drums),
Danny Weis (guitar)
