Lux Aeterna - French progressive metal band

In 2002 the story of the band began in Rennes (France). Walter Français (Drums) and Benoît Toquet (Guitar) who were already playing together met lots of musicians. At the end of 2003 they composed their first songs and wanted to search for other musicians to complete the band. That is how the progressive metal band Lux Aeterna was founded. During the following years (2004/2005) the band was disorganized. At the end of 2005 Nicolas Meyer (Piano/Keyboards), Olivier Le pech (Bass)and Maela Revolt (Vocals/Violin) joined the latter. The members released their first Demo CD called "Beyond Horizons" in 2006. They're recoring their first album...

There is also a composition by Clint Mansell, played by the Kronos Quartet, that's the theme song of Requiem for a Dream (among other films), using this name, so please check your tagging.

It should be known that there is an experimental/rock band in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area with the same name <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lux+Aeterna">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
