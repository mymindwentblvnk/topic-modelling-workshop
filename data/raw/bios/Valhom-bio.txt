Valhom was created in 1998 by Lord Temptation as a one man black metal band. Valhoms music, lyrics and artwork combine black metal, dark poetry, and dark art. The early music of Valhom is heavily influenced by early recordings of bands such as Setherial and Burzum. 

Valhoms mini cd Satans Castle was recorded in 2000 and released on Bruiser Studio Records. Satans Castle featured Tim as a session drummer.  The CD was well received in the underground metal scene. In 2002 Lord Temptation created the first full-length album entitled Journey of Blood, again released on Bruiser Studio Records. It would consist of seven new tracks as well as a revision of Throne Of Thorns from Satanâ€™s Castle. The album is considered a cult classic in the black metal underground, combining traditional black metal with elements of thrash and death metal.  Journey of blood featured Lord Conversion session drummer and synth player.

Lord Temptation took a break from the Valhom for 2 years to concentrate on other metal projects. The Valhom project then resumed in 2004 with the recording of the new full length album entitled Desolation. Desolation was recorded in 2004 and released by Ars Magna Recordings in 2005. Desolation has earned many positive reviews and has turned a lot of heads and ears. Desolation featured Lord Deception as a session drummer.

In 2006 Lord Temptation wrote the next Valhom full length album entitled Despair and was released in 2007 on Ars Magna Recordings. The Despair album has brought Valhom strong support from the underground to the point of Valhom becoming one of the top black metal acts in the US scene. 

In 2009, the full length album entitled "Decay" has been recorded and released. It features eight songs of Supreme Black Metal Violence. 

In 2010 the Valhom project has ended.
