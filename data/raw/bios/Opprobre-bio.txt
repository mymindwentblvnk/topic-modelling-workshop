Opprobre is a french post-black metal quartet from Montpellier and Paris formed in 2013 and active since the fall of 2015. The Band’s principal musical goal is to unite the traditional black metal sound and some post-rock and progressive modern tones to create an innovative musical universe.
The band’s line-up is composed of Vincent (from the french Black Metal band “Mysticisme”) as the lead singer, Cyril (from the french Raw Black Metal band “Sunnudagr”) on the bass, Olivier on the clean vocals and on the guitar and Clément (ex-member from the french Brutal Death Metal Band “Antropofago” and “Devolution”) on the guitar and the drums.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Opprobre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
