There are multiple artists named Ether : 

1) Scythrawl's project (Trails of Anguish, Unquintessence, Nefastus Dies). Genre: Depressive Québécois Black Metal http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=43734

2)An IDM trio from Florence, Italy.Andrea Bracali and Andrea Masi met in Florence in the second half of the nineties, immediately undertaking a journey/study into electronic music, experimenting and absorbing sound apparently distant from tact but totally enjoyable to the ear. After a few local performances they debut as Ether in 2001 with the self produced "Tree of Porphyry" followed by "Nunca Mais" in 2003, as well as the soundtrack to an environmental documentary about the tragedy of the oil tanker Prestige in Galizia (licensed by Atelier Distribution). Ether's minimalistic sound and strong melodic vein also drew interest from AI Records from the UK ("Hue Song" of their side project "Tin-Tole-Lata" - sampler "Station"). With the arrival of Biga, a talented DJ and manipulator from Florence, the group has expanded their range of creativity and enhanced their truly unique electronic sound. Ether have recently produced music for the compilation "Condominium" on the label Mousikelab, plus an upcoming EP "Quasi Quasar" for PersistenceBit Records, and their debut album "Intimo personelles," for the Eclectic Neapolitan label. 

In 2012 they released an  EP "Prejanka" for Lil Pitch Records including a remix By Pinch (Tectonic).
