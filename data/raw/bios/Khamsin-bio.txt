There are two artists that perform under the name 'Khamsin':
1. A rock band from Nashville, TN
2. An electronic music artist from France

1. Khamsin began as the reverb-laden solo project of Jacob Curry in 2012. After recruiting friends to flesh out his songs, the Nashville, TN-based band took a turn towards lyrically based, emo infused indie rock with jagged, linear guitar riffs and a rolling rhythm section, inspired by and in the vein of From Indian Lakes, HRVRD, Colour Revolt, and mewithoutYou. As a full band, including Cole Harrison (bass) and Darin Harger (drums), the group has shared the stage with a variety of acts throughout the Midwest and East Coast including Pianos Become the Teeth, Delta Sleep, The Appleseed Cast, Valleyheart, Caracara, Household, Salt Creek, and Author. After a string of EPs ('There Is A Place' (2012), 'I've Only Been A Thief' (2014), 'Let Me See Clearly' (2016), and 'A Brief Look Down' (2018)) and numerous regional tours with Old News, A Modest Proposal, and Idle Threat, Khamsin released their debut LP 'Whatâ€™s Left of Life' on May 13, 2022.
2. Khamsin is an electronic music artist from France, starting in 2016 with his debut 'Leaving'. He is also also a lead member of the super-group Slow Hours. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Khamsin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
