Babyfather is an experimental hip-hop project of enigmatic British artist Dean Blunt, previously known as one half of the duo Hype Williams. Presented as a quintet including DJ Escrow, Lady T (TYSON), Triumph Allah (Lord Tusk) and Gassman D, the project's recordings are fractured collages of dub rhythms, aggressive rapping, and bursts of harsh noise. Blunt initially titled a free online EP Babyfather in 2015; later in the year, he issued a mixtape titled UK2UK credited to Babyfather. In early 2016, Hyperdub issued "Meditation," a Babyfather single co-produced by Arca. Second mixtape Platinum Tears followed in February, and full-length debut BBF Hosted by DJ Escrow was issued by Hyperdub in April. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Babyfather">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
