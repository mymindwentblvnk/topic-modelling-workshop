CRAWLEY was the brainchild of two Swedish musicians, guitarist Lawrence West, ex-DAMIEN, and vocalist Joel Andersson, who had recently returned from America, breaking away from the act VITAL SIGNS. In 1992 CRAWLEY was established with an original roll call that included bassist Matte Järnil and guitarist Jonas Ragnarsson.

Having recorded and released the 'Addiction' album, Matte Järnil, who had departed to join LOST SOULS, was replaced with new man Sampo Axelsson for August 1994's 'Supersonic' album. Axelsson would later feature as a member of former DEEP PURPLE star GLENN HUGHES' band for his 'Addiction' album.

During the following year CRAWLEY actually broke up, but were to return with another fresh face in the fold, bassist Christer Goldsmith and the band's third album, 'Territorial', appeared in February 1996 through new label Roadrunner. By 2001 Goldsmith was ensconced within the ranks of FULL STRIKE, the Melodic Metal side venture convened by HAMMERFALL guitarist Stefan Elmgren. March 2005 saw Sampo Axelsson joining LION'S SHARE. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crawley">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
