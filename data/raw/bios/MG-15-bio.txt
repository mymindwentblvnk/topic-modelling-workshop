MG-15 are a Spanish d-beat band formed in 1980. MG-15’s contacts with bands & zines from many different countries helped MG-15 establish a connection worldwide. The subject matter is similar to Discharge, in that the songs’ themes are primarily on war & genocides. Like other bands at the time they leaned towards anarchism. In 1983 they recorded their first single, Caos Final. The single was recorded on an Italian label & distributed in foreign countries since their music was much harder than other Spanish bands at the time. The following year they were interviewed on Maximum RocknRoll which helped boost their fan base in Europe, as well as North America, South America, & Australia. The interview helped them become Spanish representatives on a worldwide punk compilation, with groups from 25 other countries. In 1988 they recorded “Holy Earth”, their second single, a limited edition of 330 which included two songs sung in English.

After a long silence, in 2005, MG15 recorded a split single with reformed Discharge.
