It all started during in the mid weeks of June (2011) when founder Alex Loader decided to make a project different from the rest. A project that showcases what the UK Underground Metal Scene has to offer with the best musical talents, upcoming bands and artists. Originally meant to be a Instrumental Death Metal band while having a weekly/monthly song release (or episode if you will). This was the birth of "The Deathisodes". 

In June 2012, they release their first album "Destructive Patterns Of Creation". Now only a year down the line, the project already have a second album with over 20+ guests, "Inside The Universe Of Horror", due for release on the 21st June 2013. With a new influences and inspired by the future, gaming, history and a number of others, this album takes the project onto a whole new level. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Deathisodes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
