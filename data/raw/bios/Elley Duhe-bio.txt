Elley Duhe's unique vocals are that of an 18 year old whose soulful, angelic style and song writing seamlessly express awareness beyond her years. She is rapidly gaining recognition for her unique musical style across the southeastern U.S. and beyond, thanks to a growing internet presence. At age 15 she began writing and performing her songs at coffee houses, open-mics, and any local venue that would welcome her. By 2008, she was earning a paycheck and packing venues across the coast, in addition to being voted “Best Female Vocal” on ABC’s radio show: FAMEGAMES. 2009 brought more gigs at even larger venues and Music Festivals were on the horizon. In October 2009, Elley played BAYFEST, Alabama’s largest Music Festival and in November, she shared the stage with Ashton Sheperd, Jessica Harp, Colt Ford, Crossin Dixon, and Darryl Worley. Among her most recent performances, she had the honor of opening up for Benjy Davis Project and Sister Hazel. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elley+Duhe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
