Trizz, born Arthur “Tre” Lea III, is a self-released rapper based out Los Angeles, Calif. The young rapper became an avid music aficionado at an early age, first picking up a microphone at the tender age of nine. Growing up in the suburbs of the Inland Empire, hip-hop became a way for Trizz and his neighborhood friends to escape boredom and the simplicities of living life on the outskirts. As his writing skills developed, Trizz perfected his lyrical skill and began producing his own beats and mixtapes under the moniker “Young Trizz.” His debut full-length EP, titled Young Trizz, demonstrates the journey of an independent artist looking to lead ahead of the pack.

After dropping the “Young” from his stage name to signify his adulthood, Trizz released New West, a nod to the West Coast pioneers of rap. A steady stream of digital downloads and positive reaction in the virtual world led to the release of his highly anticipated mixtap, Cruel Intentions, chronicling the highs and lows of his relationships with women.

Now at the age of 21, Trizz is indeed poised to become one of the most prolific lyricists of his time, consistently writing rhymes, producing new material and touring across the United States. The music video for his 1st single, “Skitzo,” has generated buzz among fans and newcomers hungry for his next full-length project, scheduled for late 2013.

Trizz is currently affiliated with Strange Music artist Brotha Lynch Hung. He joined Lynch’s independent label Madesicc Muzicc early 2012 when he met up with Brotha Lynch at one of Lynch’s shows in Arizona where Trizz was set to open up for Lynch but the show was cancelled that night due to unknown reasons. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trizz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
