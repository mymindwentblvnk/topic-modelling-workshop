In early 2009 artist/writer and ex-vocalist of Tokyo's Detritum, Jeremy Mauney, had the idea to create a black metal band with sci-fi elements basing song/lyrical content around his own extraterrestrial research.

After posting classified ads online looking for interested musicians, Jeremy was approached by Roland La Goy (of Inlaid Rust and Molestation). Ideas were exchanged, and NUTRITION was born.

The lyrical content of NUTRITION's songs focus on detailed 'extraterrestrial' research, ancient astronauts, and the truth of Earth's history.
