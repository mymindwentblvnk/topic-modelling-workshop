Vital Science is the progressive power metal band formed by aspiring musicians from Estonia and Latvia. The roots of the Vital Science can be traced to the latvian Distant Light and estonian Shadow Cry, who united their powers in year 2008. At the present moment band members are: Alexey Boykov - vocals, Sergey Boykov - keyboards, Rustam Guseinov - drums, Aleksandr Volpert- guitars, Vladimir Mihailitcheko - guitars, Stanislav Kilmasov â€“ bass. Musicians strongly believe in melodic approach to the song composition, but also value heavy riffs and complex arrangements. As the separate bands Distant Light had recorded two 30 minute demo albums with different lineups, and Shadow Cry has released one demo album. Band has performed extensively on stage under one name or another, effectively playing as opening act for Whitesnake, Udo, Overkill, Dark Tranquility, Samael to name a few. Stay tuned for more! .
Right now we are actively searching for a label to release a CD and also looking for concerts/festivals organizers who may include us in the lineup. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vital+Science">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
