The Dutch band Ex Libris brings new power and a fresh, exciting sound to the world of symphonic heavy  metal. Combining the melodic structure of classical music with progressive licks and hooks, Ex Libris delivered their first full-length album “Amygdala” in 2008 to great reviews. Frontwoman Dianne van Giersbergen combines powerful, soaring vocals with a dynamic range that is, frankly, intimidating. The music follows suit,  matching the vocals with an intensity that is rarely heard within the genre. 

Ex Libris have already played with the likes of Epica, ReVamp and Stream of Passion, and are now ready to take the next step with their second album. A concept album based on the well-known Greek tragedy, “Medea” will take the listener on a journey through the mind of a woman who suffers a betrayal that leads her to the most horrifying revenge imagineable: the murder of her own children. This three-track demo represents a small taste of things to come.

Ex Libris is:

Dianne van Giersbergen – Vocals
