Diaboli Imperium is a Symphonic Black Metal Band from Sao Paulo, Brazil, mainly idealized by Schmerz, Daimonos and Asterion. They were responsible for the Dimmu Borgir´s extinct tribute band “Indoctrination”. Where Diaboli Imperium was extracted and cut from.

The idea to start a band with their own compositions emerged in 2006, after some discussions amongst the band´s cast. The conclusion was that it would be better if Nazgûl left the band, and he did so.

However, the plans to carry on with the Diaboli project was frozen for some time until a good and settled cast was defined. During this time, some abstract compositions were made. However, only in 2009 the band was able to start a new age of compositions and its history changed a lot. Nazgûl was back, and other warriors joined them on their journey. Scorpio on the drums and Pantheros on the guitars and finally everything they planned for so long happened, Diaboli Imperium was born.

Nowadays, Daimonos' vocals translate hate and evil, all riffs and backing vocals of Asterion show how Diaboli Imperium is apocalyptic, the darkest musicality and speed of Pantheros brings the world to a new age of darkness, the dark symphony of Schmerz´s keyboards opens the gate to a new dimension of grief and madness and the infernal blasts and brutality of Scorpio craves a stake inside the hearts of all the living beings that listen to it.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diaboli+Imperium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
