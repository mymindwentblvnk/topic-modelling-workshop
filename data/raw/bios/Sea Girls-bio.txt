Sea Girls is a British four-piece band based in London.

Following on the heels of both the NME and Radio 1 Huw Stephens cherry-picking Sea Girls as Ones To Watch For 2018, the band released their follow up to January's HEAVENLY WAR - new single EAT ME WHOLE which furthers the bold claim that they are one of the most reliable new bands for penning these instant indie-disco, festival ready anthems.

Fronted by Henry Camamile, the single is the first to be taken from the band's third EP - EP3 which follows EP1 CALL ME OUT and EP2 HEAVENLY WAR and is another timely example of what this young British band are capable of.

Arriving in London via Leicestershire and Kent, Sea Girls know there is nothing understated or apologetic about a bold chorus, especially one that can be sung in unison by thousands of fans together of all walks of life. Sea Girls have these choruses in spades.

Henry Camamile on EAT ME WHOLE – “It’s a story about the moment at a party when it’s just about to kick off over someone being rude and one guy thinking he’s the man, but in reality they’re just killing the vibe. It was written the same day we recorded it, so it has that exciting and impulsive energy of a brand new jam, so we thought let’s do something in the moment to reflect the story of the song and see what happens. The music and the lyrics all came together and we love how it sounds.”

Following the quartets maiden UK headline tour in February, with fans screaming the words back to them the festival season is fast approaching with appearances confirmed at Reading and Leeds festival, Citadel, Truck, 110 Above, Live At Leeds, The Great Escape and Belladrum to mention but a few. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sea+Girls">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
