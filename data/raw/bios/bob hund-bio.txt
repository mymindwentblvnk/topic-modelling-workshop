bob hund is a seven-piece rock band from Sweden. Swedish for "bob dog", their name was borrowed from a television cartoon character. Their music, hard to classify, is by some described as "a frantic celebration of the power of music to invigorate and give life."

The indie rock band started in autumn 1991 and the group as it is known today was formed within about half a year. The group consists of singer Thomas Öberg, guitarists Johnny Essing and Conny Nimmersjö, bassist Mats Hellquist, Jonas Jonasson on synths, and Mats Andersson on drums.

bob hund have performed all over Scandinavia as well as in Poland and England. Some of their most notable performances have been at the Roskilde, Hultsfred, Ruisrock and Quart music festivals.

Bergman Rock is the band's English language side-project, which has released the albums "Bergman Rock" and "Bonjour Baberiba Pt II".

In 2005, Thomas Öberg and Jonas Jonasson started a DJ-duo named Sci-Fi SKANE, whose primary goal is to "create stupidity and dance." They produced an album the autumn of that year, called "Känslan av att jorden krymper växer".

In August, 2006, they announced two concerts as bob hund. This ends the band members pause from bob hund, which they have had since early 2003.

In the middle of June, Christian Gabel joined bob hund making it a seven-piece band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/bob+hund">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
