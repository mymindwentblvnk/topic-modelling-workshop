Nepal (Early) and later New York (Current) based Grindcore band with two drummers.

They self identify themselves as an "Immigrind" band, relating to their status as immigrants in America. The band is named after the Chepang people, a heavilly marginalised nomadic Tibeto-Burman Ethnic group native to Central Nepal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chepang">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
