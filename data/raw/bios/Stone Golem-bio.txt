Hailing from the Netherlands, this story driven rock band is inspired by dust, deserts, and outer space. Their music is best defined as a sandstorm of low tuned heavy rock riffs, contrasted by calm freshwater springs of psychedelic and blues orientated soundscapes. Stone Golem’s debut album, ‘The Universe of…’, was released late 2012 and shows the band’s versatility in music styles without ever losing their own progressive sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stone+Golem">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
