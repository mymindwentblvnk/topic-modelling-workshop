Witchstone ~ Calgary, Alberta Canada
Psychedelic, Doom, Groove 

"One need not venture far to identify the band's influences. Witchstone unapologetically taps the 'Sabbathian' vein, akin to 90' doom revival bands Sleep and Electric Wizard: A bubbling cauldron of churning guitar tones and volcanic yet melodic vocals atop thunderous crashing drums"
