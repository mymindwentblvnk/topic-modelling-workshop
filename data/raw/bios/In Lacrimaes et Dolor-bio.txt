The story of „In Lacrimales Et Dolor” project begins in 2009, initially as a black metal project. After some unsuccessful attempts to found a serious and lasting band, Noctis (also known as Rossielle or Velenus) decide to transform this project in an one man band, and to change the genre into Funeral doom metal, one of his older passions. In his ideas, Noctis, combines an atmospheric funeral doom with elements of dark ambient, drone and and religious subjects,with elements of orchestra and choir. In November 2012 he shows up the first single „In Lacrimales Et Dolor” that prophets an EP of 5 tracks, that might to appear in next year.
