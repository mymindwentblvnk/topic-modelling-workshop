Xerath are a progressive metal band from the UK signed to Candlelight Records. Their music draws influence from the industrial sound of Strapping Young Lad, the rhythmic complexity of Meshuggah and orchestral music to create a distinctive sound they call "orchestral groove metal".  

Formed in 2007, Xerath is comprised of guitarist Andy Phillips, drummer Michael Pitman, bassist Owain Williams, and later vocalist Richard Thomson.  Their first album, I, was released in 2009.  Their sophomore production, II, was released in 2011.
