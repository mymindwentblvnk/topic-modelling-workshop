In 2000, when left his previous extreme death metal band called "Healer", Daniel Filho just started to look for new members for a new project, with songs more technic and progressive, but still sounding pretty heavy.

Highly influenced by a band called Death, Daniel starts to find out musicians that could fit the needs of the main idea, showing up how the band was supposed to sound like for Daniel Soubihe, the first bass player of Arcane Aeon, then talking with Azzi and Geraldo, Arcane Aeon was born.

The band's members are Daniel Filho on vocals, Geraldo and Pilo on guitars and Azzi on drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arcane+Aeon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
