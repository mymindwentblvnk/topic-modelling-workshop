Silence the Witness is a 5-piece progressive melodic death metal band from St. Louis, MO. 

The band, conceived in 2014, wrote an original EP that was released for free in July 2015 across Bandcamp, SoundCloud, and YouTube.

Since its inception, Silence the Witness went through numerous line-up changes, and had the honor of working with some amazingly talented musicians. One of them being drummer Arissa Ball who unfortunately passed on as a result of her battle with Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).

The band is currently recording the spiritual successor to 2015's "Pick Your Poison [EP]" completely from scratch, with live instruments. Silence the Witness's first LP, "Pick Your Poison: Reloaded", is expected to have a late-fall 2016 release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Silence+The+Witness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
