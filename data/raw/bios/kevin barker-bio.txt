Kevin Barker is an American guitarist and sometime member of Vetiver. He has solo albums as Currituck Co. and one album, You & Me, under his own name released in 2010.

For years, Barker has juggled careers - as a musician and as a filmmaker. He spent some years recording, touring, and collaborating with Devendra Banhart, Joanna Newsom, Vashti Bunyan, Vetiver, Antony and the Johnsons, and Espers, to name just a few. Essentially acting as everyone's favorite sideman, Barker has influenced and helped create a sound with which some of this generation is happily familiar. 

Simultaneously, Barker attended film school at Columbia University, during which he shot the footage that would eventually become his feature documentary The Family Jams, which captures the 2004 tour of Banhart, Newsom and Vetiver. The Family Jams has played at the Sarasota Film Festival, Film Pop Montreal and Copenhagen International Documentary Film Festival and is still making the festival rounds. 

Barker began recording as Currituck Co. in 2002. In 2010, he released You & Me under his own name. For that latter album, produced by Thom Monahan (Vetiver, Lilys, Gary Louris, Devendra Banhart), he assembled a team of musicians including Pat Sansone (Wilco), Joanna Newsom, Jonathan Wilson (Elvis Costello, Jenny Lewis), Eric Johnson (Shins, Fruit Bats), and Otto Hauser (Vetiver, Espers). The album recalls the rustic grooves of The Band and The Grateful Dead, the heady melancholy of Roy Harper, and the golden harmonies of CSNY. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Barker">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
