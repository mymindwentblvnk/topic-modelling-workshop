The dosage of strength that is now Pillfed came to be from the guitarist's breaking point. Being fed up with the arguments and fights, the dumb ideas of dumb, incompetent people, and other such mishaps as he drifted through several bands, Sto finally decides to take matters into his own hands by putting into practice a thought he had had for quite some time. In the spring of 2008, he starts writing the concept for a demo album, and nearing the end of this tiresome process, the self-proclaimed band leader starts looking for people willing to play his music with him. This is how he finds Mesa. Although somewhat a novice, the bassist is clearly talented and has a steep learning curve, and as he joins the band, they shortly develop a strong friendship. The two start learning to play the songs together, while looking for a drummer and a vocalist. The stroke of luck appears when an older acquaintance of the guitarists, drummer Allen, returns from a 2-year stay in England. The first time they play together everything just clicks into place, and as they find his drumming suitable for their style, they agree that he would join the band. The final member added to the mix is Lasc. As he hears that the trio is looking for a vocalist, and having previously jammed with the guitarist some time ago, he quickly becomes interested in joining them. The band members decide to audition him, and are surprised of his performance, therefore having him join on the spot. The name Pillfed has a somewhat dual nature, figuratively meaning "fed up", even though the idea of it came as literal as possible. Pillfed aims to play a powerful brand of modern metal, that inspires people and infuses them with energy and strength.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pillfed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
