Still Corners is a band that formed in 2008 in London, England.  The group consists of duo Tessa Murray (vocals) and Greg Hughes (multi-instrumentalist/producer).  Since 2008 they've been joined by Leon Dufficy (guitar) and Luke Jarvis (bass) for live performances.  Jack Gooderham (drums) joined the live band in 2013.

Still Corners garnered wide critical success with a string of singles including the Don't Fall In Love/Wish 7-inch on cult label the Great Pop Supplement and the haunting Endless Summer during 2010 as well as Hughes's earlier self-released EP "Remember Pepper?". 

Their full length debut, Creatures of an Hour was launched on Sub Pop in October 2011.  The second album, Strange Pleasures was released on Sub Pop in May 2013.
