Theme Park is one of the most exciting new songwriting forces in our midst today, managing to attain that rare balance of feeling comfortingly familiar and yet not sounding like anyone else.

The four piece were formed by twin brothers Miles & Marcus Haughton earlier this year and quickly enrolling the service of old friend Oscar Manthorpe (guitar) as well as recruiting Ric Hollingbery (bass) and Phil Jordan for the drums. They are currently working on their first full length via Transgressive Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Theme+Park">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
