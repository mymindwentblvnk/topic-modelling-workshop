Modern Symphonic Dark Metal act AEONS CONFER has proven to be unlike anything in the metal landscape since their inception in 1997.

Masterminded by brothers Simon and Nils, the six musicians from Hamburg, Germany, have dedicated themselves to be a wellspring of innovativeness, complexity as well as mind-blowing musical prowess and sheer aggression. Whereas the original idea was to create the label "fast and complex Modern Symphonic Dark Metal", AEONS CONFER has by now become much more with the arrival of their first full length album "Symphonies Of Saturnus"- an unstoppable musical force that will shatter galaxies to their core!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aeons+Confer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
