With their first album, Diathra was a Belorussian melodic death metal band.  It was recorded under the influence of the very earliest albums of the Swedish death metal scene; sounding like Dark Tranquillity and In Flames in their first records.
The lineup for this album was:

Dmitry Shiyka - vocals
Irina Berestneva - vocals, keyboards
Dmitry Tracevski - guitars
Michail Sobol - guitars
Alexey Savchenko - bass
Dmitry Laptenok - drums

Their second, most recent album, My Endless Sorrow, which was released in 2008, features a new vocalist and lineup which is:

Maryna Volovik : Vocals
Alex Adamchenko : Bass
Johny Holodzow : Guitar
Dmitry Laptenok : Keyboard
Dmitry Shiyka : Vocals

This second album could be described as gothic metal, sounding almost similar to Within Temptation's earliest EPs. Though Dmitry Shiyka remains a vocalist, he doesn't dominate their sound, with Maryna Volovik fronting the band. Their sound also changed significantly with the release of My Endless Sorrow; from death metal to, again, female fronted gothic metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diathra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
