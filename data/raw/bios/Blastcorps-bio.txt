Blastcorps was created back in 2002 by Peter Paul. After a time of d.m. drumming (unexpected, sadistic, godly beings) it was time for a new challenge. The dream of writing music, singing and playing guitar. An acquaintance was brought in to help with the solo's and the first demo of Blastcorps called "The Art Of Terror" was born.

After the acquiantance left the band Aad (Infinited Hate, Houwitser, Sinister) was asked to join the band. It was a bit different for Aad  because he had to take care of vocal parts. Aad and Paul were already friends for a long time because they did a project band called Godly Beings and Aad was also doing vocals in this band so he was the right person to do the job. Aad's dedication to death metal was also a big factor.

Soon after Aad joined Blastcorps recorded a two track promo to look for a record deal. Blastcorps contacted Forever Underground and after a short time Blastcorps joined the ever growing ranks of Forever Underground.

After the signing Aad asked Toep (Putrefied) to join Blastcorps because he was the right blastmaster for the band.

In january 2005 Blastcorps hit the studio to record their debut album called "Glorified" at The Helter Belter Studio under command by Paul Beltman. Alex Paul (No Face Slave, ex-Sinister & ex-Houwitser) appears on the CD as a session bass player.

Blastcorps stands for old school death metal but with the brutality and sickness from today's metal... hail to metal! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blastcorps">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
