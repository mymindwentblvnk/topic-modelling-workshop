Holy Holy is a musical project born of award-winning singer songwriter Timothy Carroll from Brisbane and guitarist/composer Oscar Dawson (Ali Barter, Dukes of Windsor) from Melbourne. 

Dawson and Carroll met working as English teachers in South-East Asia. Over the intervening years they remained in contact, but it wasn't until they serendipitously met in Europe during 2011 that they started demoing songs. At the time, Carroll was living in Sweden and working on a solo project. Dawson was living in Berlin. When Dawson travelled to Stockholm on unrelated business, he tracked down Tim for a spare mattress; the two ended up recording a demo for what, unknown to them, would become a future Holy Holy song.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Holy+Holy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
