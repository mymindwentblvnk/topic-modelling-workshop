Hold Back The Day is a polish metal/hardcore band formed by two brothers in 2007. In 2011 HBTD had the honor to open the third editions of "Gda≈Ñsk Tattoo Konwent", whose main stars were legends of the american hardcore scene - Death Before Dishonor and Sworn Enemy. In early October band will be releasing their debut mini-album entitled "Desperate Times", which will include five tracks trully representing their style.
