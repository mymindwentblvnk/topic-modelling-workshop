Spawned By Rot was formed in the early 2003, when former Butcherd members; Brent Bell(drums), Jay Gochee(guitars) and Mark Miller(guitars) set out to crush their former accomplishments with a new death metal project that was hard driving like a tire iron to the face but still kept a brutal groove. The trio had already written seven songs when they found the perfect gutteral growler Russ Drury(vocals) and finally Ryan King(bass) a technically dynamic musician formally of Dead Jesus. With the line up complete, the rest of the album "Beyond Random Torture" was scribed with unrelenting fury. In its two plus years of existence Spawned By Rot has built a solid live performance, having played many clubs, halls, festivals and some touring. We have shared the stage with such genre defining bands as Suffocation, Cryptopsy, Infernal Majesty, Aborted, Kataklysm, Behemoth, Necronomicon, Despised Icon and Bitch Splitter. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spawned+By+Rot">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
