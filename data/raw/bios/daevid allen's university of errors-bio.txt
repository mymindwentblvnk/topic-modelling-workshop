Well, to begin with, for those of you who don't know, Daevid Allen was a member of both Soft Machine and Gong. He practically invented Gong and its "affiliates", if you will, sometimes working with his wife/partner Gilli Smyth, who is often credited with delivering a "space whisper" into the mix, other times working with a certain Japanese space-rock outfit called Acid Mothers Temple (Acid Mothers Gong). He has also dubbed him/them Planet Gong on Earth. This, his University of Errors, is then yet another "side project" of sorts. Allen still records/performs with Gong members past and present, most recently with the above-mentioned Acid Mothers Gong. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daevid+Allen%27s+University+of+Errors">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
