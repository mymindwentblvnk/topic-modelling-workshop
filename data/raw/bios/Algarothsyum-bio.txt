Algarothsyum is a one-man atmospheric instrumental metal project, in a post-apocalyptic theme. The project was originated in Atlanta, GA, and currently resides in Clarksville, TN.

The idea of Algarothsyum was actually conceived back in 2001, when then high school student Vhyle desired to start a solo metal project. Being an active student of music by performing on drums and percussion through his school years, he decided to pursue music further by learning to play guitar and writing his own music. Over the years, the project has slowly but surely formed into ideas, riffs and concepts. As life progressed, Algarothsyum spent a lot of time in the shadows, with said ideas and concepts going untouched - until now. 
 
Since 2008, Vhyle has actively pursued in resurrecting the project, and started recording his collection of ideas to share with the ever-changing, expanding world of extreme metal. 

Vhyle is no stranger to the world of bands and live music, however. He has played with several local bands and projects over the years. He has played drums for local bands Damnesia, Jesus Christler, Malefic, Forbidden Words, and has recorded drums and guitars for various other projects as well.
 
The concept of Algarothsyum's theme is based on a world consumed in a post-apocalyptic existence. The music and atmosphere help portray a mental picture of life and survival in a nuclear wasteland. Fans of death metal and post-apocalyptic fiction should find enjoyment in Algarothsyum's music.
 
Vhyle currently writes and records all music for the project.
