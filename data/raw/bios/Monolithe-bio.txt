Monolithe is, contrary to popular belief, a one-man project with multiple side musicians. Sylvain BÃ©got, the mastermind behind Monolithe is involved in the epic doom metal band Anthemon. Monolithe strays from the eclectic atmosphere that Anthemon presents, and dishes an absolutely demented, depressive soundscape.

Such, the band is infamous for making both their first releases, I, II, III and IV, in one long, desperate song. Both exceed 50 minutes in length and, even while possessing this length, never begin to sound monotonous. Some keyboards and on Monolithe II, accordions meet their funeral doom songs. 

In late 2015, Monolithe released the first in what was planned as a two-part album : Epsilon Aurigae.
Instead of one hour long track, the record featured three 15 minute pieces. About 7 months later, the band is unleashing the follow up, and second part of this new era of Monolithe, entitled Zeta Reticuli. Being similar to its predecessor as far as artwork, track lengths and overall approach, the record still manages to feel different and is yet another strong entry in the Monolithe catalogue.
