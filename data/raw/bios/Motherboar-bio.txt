Formed in 2004, in Boston, Massachusetts, Motherboar is a post-stoner rock quintet comprised of vocalist Kenny Irwin, guitarists Pete Knipfing (former guitarist and frontman for Lamont) and Brian Connor, bassist Joe Grotto, and drummer Benny Grotto. Known for their unruly live performances, the group has drawn favorable comparisons to Clutch, Mot√∂rhead and Scissorfight, and toured alongside The Sword, Angry Samoans and Orange Goblin. Their debut mini-LP, Raise the Death Toll, was produced by Andrew Schneider (Cave In, The Red Chord, Unsane, etc.) and released by Witch Trial Records in 2006.

In order to pursue Mess With the Bull (w/ members of Scissorfight) Pete Knipfing played his last show with Motherboar in May of 2007. His replacement is former Codetta guitarist and hockey enthusiast, Andrew Doherty. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Motherboar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
