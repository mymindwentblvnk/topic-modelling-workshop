Polish death metal act from Lublin, Poland, formed in 1989. Despite being veterans of the Polish death metal scene, their music is far more similar to bands from the NYDM scene. Their first release was a demo-tape named "Apocalyptic Obsession", in June 1990. The next year they put out a live split tape with fellow death metal/grindcore band Vexation. In 1992 they released another demo, Displeasure, and in 1996 another rehearsal. In March 1998 they entered studio to re-record their 1992 demo, dubbing it Veritatis Splendor, with a newly written track. 2000 saw the release of a compilation (The Truth Revealed) containing their previous EP and 4 unreleased tracks. In 2002 they made available a 3-track promo (Blessed Amongst the Flock), for the release of their 2009 album called Abandon Your Lord. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Convent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
