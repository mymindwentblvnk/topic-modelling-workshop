3) RAPTOR was officially born on 2003, from the ashes of several previous projects and after some line-up changes, when Rodrigo Valdes joined Andres Herrera, Andres Lozano and Alejandro Diaz to complete which - for quite a few years - was a musical project with no major ambitions than enjoying playing music among friends.

It is from 2006 when a clear target is set up to record their debut album; which was produced by our friend Sergio "Galleta" Arenas and recorded at Maestria Estudios. Nothing but Rage includes 10 powerful and deep songs, loaded of energy, which summarize the work performed all these years together… RAPTOR is here to stay, keep in contact!
