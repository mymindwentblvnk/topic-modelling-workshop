Faces On TV is Jasper Maekelberg's musical project.

Based in the Belgian city of Ghent, Faces On TV brings something rattling-tight, tender-punchy, Beatles-Beck, noisy-pop...-ish. They've just recorded an EP which will soon be sent into the world.

Influences? Wilco, Beck, the Beatles, Radiohead and all the other good stuff.

The Belgian radio channel Radio 1 called Faces On TV "maybe the best of this season." 
Also the music magazine Rif Raf discovered Faces On TV: "New sweet stuff of the finest class ... sympathetic madness ... a fascinating listening experience"
