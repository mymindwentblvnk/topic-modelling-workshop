Hyperblast was born in Pavia in late 2015. 
After splitting their previous project (Over Studs), cousins Simone and Andrea decide to start a new Thrash band.
Shortly after they met guitarist Gianluca, who also decided to fill the role of singer.
A couple of months later, Federico, formerly drummer of the fellow band Forgery System, joins the band.
Their first Ep, "Nuclear Pest Control" was released on June 23, 2017.
On May 10, 2019 the band releases the single "Alkoholik Habiz". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hyperblast">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
