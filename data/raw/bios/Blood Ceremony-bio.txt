Blood Ceremony, an infernal marriage of Black Sabbath riffing and the manic piping of Jethro Tull, play a distinctive style of flute-tinged witch rock. After a mind-numbing study of hundreds of trashy witchcraft films, the group began to pour their energies into crafting songs, transforming their fascination for horror into a profane musical vision. 

Their sound bears witness to the heavy bands of yesteryear, fusing progressive rock elements with folk and an early '70s downer vibe. Invoking the mischievous Pipes of Pan, Blood Ceremony songs are distinguished by singer Alia O'Brien's flute solos - accenting an instrument long-associated with a list of devilish figures. 

A celebration of Euro-horror, '60s saturnalia and occult miscellanea, their self-titled debut was mixed by Billy Anderson and released by Rise Above in 2008 to enthusiastic reviews. In 2009, Blood Ceremony completed a successful European tour supporting doom legends Electric Wizard. 

Living With The Ancients, Blood Ceremony's sophomore album, expands the group's dark and regal sound with a heavy dose of vintage organ, gritty guitars and stirring flute harmonies. The album was recorded in Chicago by Sanford Parker, who completed the final mixes on Samhain Day. With "Living With the Ancients," Blood Ceremony continues its journey through the mire of ancient occultism and flute-infused downer rock. The album was released on March 1, 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blood+Ceremony">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
