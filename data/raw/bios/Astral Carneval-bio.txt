Astral Carneval was formed in Eskilstuna, Sweden in late 2002 by Magnus and Kenneth. Shortly thereafter Per joined in. By this time we were playing with an old friend of Kenneth named Göte on drums and in early 2003 we recorded the song “All you ever wanted” in the Trick Track Studio. Due to the lack of bass player, the bass was played by Magnus. This recording was engineered by Ivan Jovanovic, old time friend of Göte and also a bass player. Shortly after the studio session Ivan joined in with the rest of us and the circle of Astral Carneval was now completed.
