The band, hailing from Chandigarh, India, came together as a result of five friends just randomly jamming together. Been playing for a year, participating in many competitions and performing at many local events.

The band, initially wanting to cover nu metal, finally found its sound in groove metal band, Lamb of God. What started as a Lamb of God cover band, slowly drifted into a progressive groove metal band.

Having members with different music choices, the lead guitarist, Adamya, grand son of pt.
