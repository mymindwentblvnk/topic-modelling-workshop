2)Codex alimentarius is not only sound,
- maybe it's more a never-ending journey through relationships, inner thoughts
and daily madness.

the lyrics walk between melancholy
and some deeper darker moods
without in any way to loose ideas and hope.
The band started as a 3 men project in germany
around june 2009 with their attempts
at some experimental ways of working with sounds,
vocals and different samples.

Soon it became an intersting project and after a while,
the idea for Codex Alimentarius was born
and they spread their first songs
through the world weird web.

Now Codex Alimentarius is just a band with 2 members who are
"boy in a suitcase" and "rue23".
The old singer split from the band to go another way
but their was still the idea to keep this music
and band alive.
Was not a bad idea by the way and so rue23 tried to do
his first steps in german lyrics and vocals.
After the first recordings and work outs, the band recognised
that this could be good and so boy in a suitcase was working out
more on sound and melodies in times,
while rue23 started to focus his mind more on vocals
and working more with background sounds.

So after a break of 2 months codex alimentarius was back.
The music is influenced by industrial, ambient, classical elements
and atonal noises mixed with a deep voice... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Codex+Alimentarius">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
