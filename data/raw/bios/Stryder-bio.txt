"We are STRYDER and we are from outer space! We have been set on a path to blow peoples minds with psychedelic rock and roll!"


STRYDER began when the suns rays passed through a Kaleidoscope upon four young boys from the sunshine coast. This gave birth to the rich, moist, colourful sounds of psychedelic rock and roll which the band create. With the release of their new ep 'Kaleidoscope', their music has become an aphrodisiac to music lovers of the world.
