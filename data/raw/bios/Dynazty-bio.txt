Dynazty was formed in early 2008 by five young talents. This thunderous hard rock/heavy metal group dominated the Swedish live scene with its flamboyant shows and powerful anthems for many months before hooking up with producer Chris Laney to record a debut album.

For one month Dynazty worked with Laney at the Polar Studios in Stockholm, creating a fierce album that will make a lasting impression. This masterpiece will be known as "BRING THE THUNDER" and will be released worldwide on PERRIS RECORDS 2nd of June 2009.

Dynazty consists of Rob Love - guitars, formerly of Zan Clan, John Berg - guitars, formerly of Sharp, George Egg - drums and Joey Fox - Bass, both from Foxey and rising star Nils Molin on Vocals.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dynazty">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
