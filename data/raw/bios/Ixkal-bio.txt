Ixkal was born in San Pedro Sula in the year 2014 as a result of the convergence of musical ideas of two former members of the band Profetas, Gustavo Blair and Dennis quant with former leader of the band Wicked Luis Argüello, also from San Pedro Sula .

Ixkal creates an amalgamation between thunderous thrash riffs along with the melodic crudity of deathcore and melodic death metal.

As a commitment to the Honduran metal, Ixkal decides from the beginning to play unpublished material so that from his birth is locked in studio to create his first EP which has 4 songs which were done in lyrics and music by Dennis and Gustavo, to this adding the production of Luis Argüello. The EP called "Desde las Cenizas" was delivered to the public in 2014 as a sample of the line that will follow the band.

In 2017, the band released their first full-length album, called "El Sexto Dia".
