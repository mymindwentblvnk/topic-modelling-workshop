Black Metal with War themes from Sacramento, California

Founded in 2007 to combine the atmosphere of brutal life in The Great War (1914-1918) trenches with raw old school black metal and a touch of nihilism for good measure.

Minenwerfer does not adhere to any political ideologies.

Split up in March 2014. Returned again in 2016.
