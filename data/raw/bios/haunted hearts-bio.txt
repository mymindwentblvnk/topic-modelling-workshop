1) Haunted Hearts is Dum Dum Girls' Dee Dee Penny and her husband, Brandon Welchez of Crocodiles.

2) Haunted Hearts is based in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. It is a vehicle for the songs of Dennis Ellsworth. The line up includes Mike MacDougall, Blue Gillis, Dan Currie, and Johnny Ross. 

Haunted Hearts began as a side project but soon became much more than that. The early live shows were well attended and praised from the start. After only four months as a band, they set up to record at Mike MacDougall’s house on Valentine’s Day and proceeded to record, live off the floor, over the following two days with Adam Gallant. The result, Thank You, Goodnight, was released in the summer of 2009.

The sound is a blend of roots, folk, honky-tonk, and country. The writing is dark, and the chemistry, dynamic, and skill of the band is clearly displayed on the record. If you asked Haunted Hearts who they would like to be compared to, it would be The Band. Not because they sound alike, although the organ and piano playing comes close, but more in the attitude and how they approach the music. Haunted Hearts approach the music delicately, and love to let the music guide them through. It is easy to over think or complicate music. Haunted Hearts apply a method that allows things to fall into the right places naturally. They believe that’s how it should be. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Haunted+Hearts">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
