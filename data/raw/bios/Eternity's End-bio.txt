In 2014, Christian Muenzner (ex-Obscura, ex-Necrophagist) put together "Eternity's End". It's the realization of a dream Muenzner had for many years to return to the style of music which has been his first love, that is neoclassical power metal with a progressive twist and a powerful, classic metal vocalist. Between fall 2013 and winter 2014/2015 he wrote 10 songs for the debut album "The Fire Within", which was recorded between December 2014 and May 2015. The album was, like Muenzner's last solo album, mixed, mastered and co-produced by Per Nilsson of Scar Symmetry.

The line up of the band consists of:

Ian Parry - vocals

Christian Muenzner - guitars

Jimmy Pitts - keyboards

Linus Klausenitzer - bass

Hannes Grossmann - drums

It is basically the same line up as Muenzner's last solo album "Beyond The Wall Of Sleep" with the addition of Ian Parry on vocals. Ian Parry used to be the vocalist of dutch prog/power metal legends Elegy and also has his own group "Consortium Project", as well as a long solo career and guest contributions for Ayreon and many others.

The music on "The Fire Within" is a blend of 90's European power metal, 80's neoclassical guitar&keyboard wizardry, powerful classic metal vocals, thrashy riffing, progressive elements and a combination of Dio-esque dark, fantasy inspired lyrics and philosophic themes. Speed, aggression, virtuoso musicianship, epic melodies and memorable songwriting with catchy hooks are the cornerstones of the band's sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eternity%27s+End">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
