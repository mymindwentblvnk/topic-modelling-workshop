There are currently two Rinoas: one British, one from the US.

Rinoa (UK):

Formed in Essex in July 2007, Rinoa features ex-members of Crydebris, Chariots and Symmetry. Some of their key influences included Envy, Mono and Devil Sold His Soul. 2008 saw the release of their debut EP produced and recorded at Bandit Studios by Johnny Renshaw of Devil Sold His Soul. Rinoa followed up their debut EP in 2009 with a Bossk split featuring new song 'Fires In The Distant North' and live favourite 'Eyes Closed', a newly recorded song that pre-dates the EP. Both recorded in January 2009 again with Jonny Renshaw.
In 2010 Rinoa released 'An Age Among Them'. They announced their split on 13th October 2010, but  finished their November tour as planned.

The record was recorded primarily by Eisenberg but included collaborations with drummer Kevin Werkheiser. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rinoa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
