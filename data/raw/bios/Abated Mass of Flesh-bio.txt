Abated Mass of Flesh is project that was started in 2011 by Zack Plunkett. For the first year he performed all the instruments and vocals and released an EP titled, Moth and Rust in the Temple of Putridity on July 6, 2011. In 2012, Zack hired his brother Matthew to take over Vocals and his friend Logan Hayworth to play Bass.

In January 2013, Zack worked at a store and found Drummer Kade Dodson when he came in one day and commented on Zack's shirt, a T-shirt that had the name of the Brutal death metal band, Dying Fetus.[7] The project became a full-fledged band by that point.[8] Later that year, the band released Brutal Death[9] and The Anatomy of Impurity.[1][3] Brutal Death was mastered by Rocky Gray of Living Sacrifice, Soul Embraced and Evanescence fame.[10] After finding Dodson, the band embarked on a Mini Tour, as well as their first, with Broken Flesh, performing only on two dates in Arkansas and Texas.[11] During this time, the band was recording their debut studio album, entitled The Omen King and another EP called Deathcrusher.[12] After the recording process, Hayworth left the band. In 2013, the band found Max "Mormegil" Tubville to take over the bass position.

In 2014, the band's debut full-length studio album, The Omen King was released by Rottweiler Records.[13] Soon after the release Dodson quit the band. The band found Drummer Riley Wingate and his brother Thomas Wingate, to take over Rhythm Guitars. The band toured with Every Knee Shall Bow in this time. This tour was EKSB's Vocalist Chris Hull's final tour with the band.[14]

In 2015, the band released their fifth EP, titled Abhorrent Postmortal Vicissity. On June 8, 2016, the band released a Live EP entitled Descended Upon the Deceased. The EP was said to be some live songs with a few songs of new material for an upcoming full-length album.[15] On December 2, 2016, the band announced that their new album would be titled Lacerated and released in January 2017.[16][17] It came out on 5 May 2017 via Sevared Records.[18]

On August 25, 2017, the band released their third album, Eternal Harvest independently.[19] The band is currently working on a new full-length album for 2018. On October 18, 2018, it was announced that Kade Dodson, the band's former drummer, died from undisclosed circumstances at the age of 33 on October 12th.[20] On November 12, the band announced the re-release and re-recording of "Undeserved", in respect of the 7 year anniversary of Moth and Rust in the Temple of Putridity, with the track set to come out on November 16th.

In mid-2019, the band was announced to perform on the second Hasten Revelation tour lineup, alongside Cardiac Rupture, Taking the Head of Goliath, Broken Flesh, and a reunited Crimson Thorn set for March 7-14, 2020.[21] Due to health concerns, Broken Flesh dropped off the tour, with My Place Was Taken joined in their place. On February 14, 2020, the band released an EP, Not Burned, and signed with Justified Insanity Records.[22]
