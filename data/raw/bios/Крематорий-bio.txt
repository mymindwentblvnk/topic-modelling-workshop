Krematorij (Крематорий) is a Russian rock group. The group’s front man (and main song writer) is Armen Grigoryan (Армен Григорян).

The group was formed in 1983 by Armen Grigoryan (Армен Григорян) and Viktor Troyegubov (Виктор Троегубов) and quickly grew in popularity {[fact}} in the rock circles of Moscow. After the release of Illusionary World (Иллюзорный мир) in 1985, the group gained a reputation throughout the former Soviet Union and began to perform at concerts all over the country. However, Troyegubov left as a result of discord between the two leaders and formed a new project called Smoke (Дым). Krematorij continued to increase in popularity [citation needed] until several group members left again after the release of Coma (Кома) in 1988. Grigoryan succeeded in drawing new musicians to the band. The line-up has otherwise been unchanged to this day.

Troyegubov temporarily returned to the group in 1993 as both a musician and the director of the group. In 1994, the group worked on the film Tatsu (Тацу); however, the film was not a success and was never brought to rental, though clips from the film are frequently used in Krematorij’s music videos. After another quarrel, Troyegubov left the group for a second and final time. He later wrote a book entitled Life in Krematorij and Outside It (Жизнь в „Крематории“ и вне его) in which he makes many accusations against Grigoryan. He returned to Smoke which quickly dissipated.

Meanwhile, Krematorij continued its creative life, releasing several more albums and performing on tours all over the world [citation needed]. Krematorij contributed greatly to the development of the Russian rock music genre. Grigoryan composes multifaceted lyrics that frequently deal with the themes of life and death in various religious contexts. The use of the violin serves to give Krematorij an individuality that has been essential to the group’s continued popularity <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
