Madking Ludwig's sound comes straight out of their own Bermuda Triangle, emanating from somewhere between desert rock, metal and prog rock. Originating from Montreal, they have been creating their style of music since 1997, blending vocal harmonies and woodwind instruments with the crushing mix of fuzzed-out heavy rock. The band, consisting of Stéphane Bellemare (Lumberjack), Leïla Jolin-Dahel (replacing Sophie Bourassa as of "Seven Stairways"), Raphaël Corbeil (Karmadoza), Patrick Falardeau and Stéphane Vigeant (Groovy Aardvark, Floating Widget, Karmadoza), has been averaging about two shows a year, turning each live performance almost into an event! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Madking+Ludwig">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
