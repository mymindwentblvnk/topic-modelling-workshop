Plastiscines are a female rock band from Saint-Cyr-l'École, France. The original lineup consisted of Katty Besnard, Marine Neuilly and Zazie Tavitian who met each other in Mansart High School where they bonded over their love of rock 'n' roll music. At the end of 2003, they met Louise Basilien at a The Libertines gig, and she became their fourth girl, the bassist. Listening to The Beatles, they took their name "Plastiscines" from a lyric in the song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.

After the release of their first album LP1 Zazie left the band because she felt like she was not a strong enough drummer. Caroline was hired as a replacement for the tour, but was not an official member of the band. During the recording of their sophomore album, About Love, Anaïs Vandevyvere joined the band as the newest drummer. They were signed to Nylon Records.

In February 2011, Marine left the band. Katty, Louise and Ana continue as a three piece band. They released their third album Back To The Start in 2014. 

In February 2016, Katty and Ana released the first single of their more alternative rock side-project Arizona Twins.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Plastiscines">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
