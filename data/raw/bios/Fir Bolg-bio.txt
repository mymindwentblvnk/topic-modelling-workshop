Fir Bolg was created in 2006 with the only member Dagoth, officiating at guitar, bass and singing. Other instruments were being played by session musicians.
Having acquired an experience of compositions since 1999 with his other band Assacrentis (Melodic Black-Metal), Dagoth dashes into this project paganism. The universe of the lyrics based on the story of our ancestors before the time of the Christianity, and myths and Celtic legends is going alongside a musical dark atmosphere and old school Black-Metal with sometimes a folk acoustic touch.
During the course of the year on 2006 Dagoth enters the Harkam azilum Studio to record a demo CD containing 4 titles called "Paganism".
In summer 2008 the MCD is pressed to 500 copies.
Dagoth then made a Line-Up of live session, and Fir Bolg made his first scenic performances through France to promote the MCD.
In June 2009 Fir Bolg points out by the German label Schwarzdorn Production, and signs its first contract to re release the demo â€œPaganism" to press again 1000 copies with a new packaging to make a larger European promotion.
In September, 2011 Dagoth entered the studio to record the first album of Fir Bolg called " Towards ancetral lands " made of 8 titles and one intro. Dagoth records voices, acoustic guitars, bodhran and olifan in the Deaf lab studio at Monaco, as well as the drums played by Abaddon, already live session drummer of Fir Bolg since 2008. Dagoth records guitars and bass at the Permafrost studio. The mix and re-amping are made by Damien Rainaud in Omen recording studio at Los Angeles. During February 2012 the album is mastered by Markus stock (Empyrium, The vision bleak) at the Klangschmiede studio E in Germany. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fir+Bolg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
