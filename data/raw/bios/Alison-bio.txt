There are more than one artist named Alison.
1) Alison are:
 Karin Bolin Derne (Vocals)
 S.E.M. Hilti Johansson (Synthesizers)

What started out as a one off live engagement took a turn for the better when Karin Bolin and Magnus Johansson decided to continue their journey down memory lane, exploring the crumbs that Mr Clarke and Ms Moyet left so many years ago...

The duo has evolved from simply performing covers of the originators Yazoo into writing their own material, inspired both in style and sound of that early 80's smash hit group!

2) Alison is a Japanese grunge 4 piece musical group from Japan.
