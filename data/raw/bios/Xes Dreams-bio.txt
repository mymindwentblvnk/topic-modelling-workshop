Also known as XsD, Xes Dreams was formed in 2007. After a series of concerts the band became famous for its specific fancy-dress shows, dramatic vocals and atmospheric music. In 2008 the band got the title of ‘the best Odessa rock-group’ and took the first place in ‘Pykeynie Jilety’ competitions.

In 2009 Xes Dreams started work at their first full-length album ignoring all events and festivals. For this time new image and sound conceptions were designed and realized.

The band is experimental metal: every track has its own character and scenario. However, their works have a mutually consistent dark frame of mind.

In view of album release two web-singles – ‘March feat. Lestar’, ‘Delta Orionis’ – were represented at the end of 2010.

All musical raw-materials were recorded at LETA Production studio, based by Yuri ‘Lead’ Zabelyn (Hranitely band) and Tony Alien (Ungrace band). In December 2010 Xes Dreams joined Russian project “Front of music liberation-2” supported by the one of most popular metal-magazines ‘Dark City’.

The first LP album NC-17 has been released in 18/12/2011. The current line-up consist of: Alex Chechelnitskiy: Keyboard, Paul Koshka: Bass, Yuriy Yatsuk: Guitar and Valeria Finikopulo: Vocals.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/XES+Dreams">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
