Formed in 2009 by Bert Trejo and Jose Gutierrez as a way to express their passion for Grindcore music.

The 1st full live line-up consisted of Bert Trejo on vocals, Jose Gutierrez and Fern Portillo (ex-Six Million Dead, ex-Conquer All) on Guitars, Lynn Bromenschenkel (Unholy Monarch) on Bass and Joe Dashee (ex-After The Death of Man) on Drums. This line-up played around AZ for a few months during 2011, with notable shows with Lightning Swords of Death and Italy's The Secret taking place. The band then reverted back to just Jose and Bert and they began finishing the writing process for the debut album. During this time, the band got back in contact with an old friend named Javier Sauceda (Six Million Dead, ex-What Dark Creates). After a few freestyle jams, the band asked him to join and he became Sado's new lead vocalist. As the band was getting ready to enter the studio, they found a bassist by the name of Andy Ciulla, who ended up recording 5 songs on the debut album.
Before the album was released, Bert Trejo decided to leave the band. The band continued to play live with session drummers for a few shows. They are currently getting ready to release 3 new songs on a split release with another AZ band as well as beginning the writing process for their next full release. They are also currently seeking a full-time drummer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sadomasochist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
