1.  Killer Instinct were from Queens and Manhattan, and were composed of guitarist Jet Suicide, drummer Bobby Skull, bassist Kitty Hawk, and vocalist Carolyn Lengle. Their two songs, "Killer Instinct" and "Torture You First", were recorded at the band's rehearsal studio, Rock Bite. Killer Instinct's first gig was at A7 in January 1982, and the band broke up six months later, before The Big Apple: Rotten to the Core had even been released. They later regrouped (with Meryl "Lynch" Hurwich replacing Suicide) as XKI, whose song "I Hate Everything" appeared on the 1983 7" compilation EP Big City Aint Too Pretty. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Killer+Instinct">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
