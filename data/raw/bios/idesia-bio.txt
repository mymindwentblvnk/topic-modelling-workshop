Idesia is an electronic soul group based in Los Angeles. With Chicago native, Sophie Dimitroff's ultra versatile, jazz trained vocals, Colton toy's killer keys, and the deep deep pocket of Brandon Combs and Daniel Oldham, Idesia's music is equally suited to headphone eargasms and a night of dancing and drinking with friends. They draw influence from current bands like Hiatus Kaiyote and Little Dragon, as well as icons such as Erykah Badu and J Dilla. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/idesia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
