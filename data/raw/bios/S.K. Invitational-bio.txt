S.K.Invitational- that means 15 musicians shifting the border of live music a step further. The combination of bigband sound, pumping beats and deep bass lines brings a new flavour to your eardrum. The musicians energy, their musical skills create a stunning sound, a monumental storm of unheard-of tunes ranging from HipHop, Dancehall and Drum n Bass to Jazz. This band extraordinary, novel sound demands a special instrumental cast of young upcoming musicians. The two drummers harmonize with easiness and complexity as you may know it from artists like AphexTwin or Squarepusher. Solos and rap-parts melt into one, hornparts join melody and groove together and fast unisono-lines get destroyed by hard effects. On its debut album S.K.Invitational features well known artists lilke Nils Wogram, Flip (of Texta), Lylit, Mono&Nikitaman, Thaiman, Rufus and Armenofils.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/S.K.+Invitational">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
