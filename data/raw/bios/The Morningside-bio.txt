The Morningside is a doom metal band from Moscow, Russia. The band was formed in 2003 by Ilya Yegorychev and Igor Nikitin.

The music of The Morningside can be described as doom metal, the musicians made their own sound, introducing their vision of Russian autumn into their music. Melancholic guitar plunks and atmospheric ambient in combination with desperate grim-voice and forlorn clean vocals  definitely won't leave you untouched.
