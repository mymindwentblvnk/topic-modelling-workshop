Somniae Status' sound is heavy and melodic with a strong personality, expressed with an awesome energy on stage. Their hard 'n' heavy attitude is enhanced by the strong guitar bite of Alex Danieli and Randy Mion, creating memorable melodies with the strong sound textures that characterize the style of the band. Their amazing debut album "Cassandra" is a powerful concept-album carved out by Alex and Randy's everchanging incisive riffs, album full of tasteful arrangements of choruses and harmonies. 
Their second album "Echoes" is more powerful and direct than ever, and unites the memorable melodies of classic HEAVY METAL with strong sound textures and darker atmospheres.
