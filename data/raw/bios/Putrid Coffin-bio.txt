Putrid Coffin began in 2010 with the aim of performing a speed and dark deathrash metal, influenced by old school thrash, death and deathrash cult bands.
The members come from different projects inside the underground, with no future projections, who joining themselves, focused to specify a personal music label, without neglecting their roots. The lyrics are about antichristianism, the humans' dark side, and mainly the death.
After a slow process and several rehearsal recordings, they start the Under the Cementery record in 2015, which is made of seven furious, dark and speed deathrash metal tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Putrid+Coffin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
