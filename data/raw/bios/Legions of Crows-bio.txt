Legions Of Crows are Blackened Doom - big riffs, rasping vocals, slow as hell with blast beats. The message is hatred of oppression, politics and religion with respect to those who eschew the tedious ephemera of society and go their own way. The first album will be released on Satanica Records very soon and will have the track listing : Hymn, Fellating the Lamb, Defecate, Carrion Pond Drove, Legions Of Crows,  Bullshit Acres, Coventry Carol and Dull Grey. Slow pounding evil. Old school Doom meets Mayhem with the ambience of Xasthur...not nice.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Legions+of+Crows">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
