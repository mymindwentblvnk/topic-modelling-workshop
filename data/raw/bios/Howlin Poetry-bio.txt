After a few gigs in 2005/2006 with the names of Gantz, Primal Age, Villanova Junction, Danishmendt, Conniving Silence, Sworn or Scold For Wandering, we recorded our first demo in August '06, named "Sunday Evening". It was recorded and mixed by Robin Fernette at the Enjoy The Silence Studio, and mastered by Clement Decrock at Boss Hog Studio.
After a long period of silence, the band is back. "Sunday Evening" is finally released through Ora Serrata and Marvel Music Motion in February 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Howlin+Poetry">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
