Midi Mafia is a hip-hop/R&B production duo consisting of American Bruce Waynne (born Waynne Nugent) from Brooklyn, New York and Canadian Dirty Swift (born Kevin Risto) from Ottawa, Ontario. They are most notable for their production of 50 Cent's number-one single "21 Questions".

They also produced "When I See U", the second single from Fantasia Barrino's self-titled album Fantasia which held the number one spot for eight weeks on the U.S. Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. More recently, they contributed a track to fellow American Idol contestant David Archuleta's self-titled debut album, released in November 2008. They have also produced for artists such as Jennifer Lopez, Bravehearts, Gemma Fox, Jean Grae, Talib Kweli, Young Buck, Nelly, Miri Ben-Ari, John Legend, Lloyd Banks, Brandy and Justin Bieber.

In July 2010, "Phamous," a song they produced, was used as a backing track for a flash mob. The flash mob was conceived by YouTuber ShayCarl, who was assisted by fellow Youtubers: LisaNova, MysteryGuitarMan, KassemG, Denise Vlogs, TimothyDeLaGhetto2, and HiImRawn.

"Phamous" is also being used in promos for VH1 television programs. Midi Mafia currently produced their own album Vegas Lights as well as the main hit "2 Piece (So Cosmo)."

On July 16, 2010, the video for "Phamous" debuted on YouTube on TheStation channel, a collaboration channel of most of the YouTubers of the original flash mob, including the lyric about being "friends with ShayCarl." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Midi+Mafia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
