2. Malice is a female underground rap artist with styles ranging from hip hop to horrorcore and in between. She's done club hits, crunk, hardcore, and regular hip hop, but her main focus for the last few years has been horrorcore and spittin' that sick shit. Representin' Texas and the south to the fullest, she ignites the mic with explicit, x-rated, and anger driven lyrics. She's been writing lyrics since 1990 and doesn't plan to stop anytime soon. Malice meaning "to cause suffering to others, the quality of threatening evil" came about when she started putting her lyrics to beats. With a style so diverse, Malice is as unpredictable as they come with songs ranging from True Crime and serial killer based to relationships and sex hits. She's truly one female artist in the underground that won't be forgotten. http://facebook.com/deadgirlmalice http://reverbnation.com/deadgirlmalice
