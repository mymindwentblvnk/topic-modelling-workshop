Cee Lo Green (born Thomas Callaway)started off as one of the members of the Southern Rap Group "Goodie Mob". After putting out three albums with this group, he branched off on his own and started his solo career under the Arista Label.

His debut album, "Cee Lo Green and His Perfect Imperfections" was released in 2002 and contained the hit track "Closet Freak" among other interesting tracks which garnered attention. This album was unlike anything out there during the beginning of the Neo-Soul movement and received acclaim for its musical creativity, but it did not manage to go mainstream.

Cee-Lo went back to the studio and started work on his next album, "Cee-Lo Green Is the Soul Machine" which was released in 2004. This album contains the hit tracks, "The One", "The Art of Noise", and "Living Again". Cee-Lo collaborated with some top producers while making this album, including Timbaland, The Neptunes, and DJ Premier.

Finally, in 2006 Cee-Lo Green found critical acclaim as half of the group Gnarls Barkley. Their debut album, "St. Elsewhere," features the smash hit "Crazy"; a second album, "The Odd Couple," has recently been released.
