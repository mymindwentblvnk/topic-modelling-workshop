The Golers were born from the desire to create an aggressive blend of metal, punk and all points in between. With veteran underground musicians Walter Mason (Charlie Goler) on guitar/lead vocals, Derek Rockall (Henry Goler) on guitar/vocals, Geoff Tan (Cecil Goler) on bass/vocals and Jason Mosdell (Cranswick Goler) on drums, they had no trouble finding their own sound.

Armed with their instruments and wife-beater shirts, the Golers built a local fanbase soon after they released their debut CD, in late 1999. Entitled "South Mountain Syle", the disc spread quickly throughout the metal and punk communities garnering respect from their musical peers in Vancouver. The recording showcased a bombastic twist of punishing riffs, chaotic beats and incestuous melodies that raped your ears and left you begging for more.

During the next couple of years, the Golers refined their sound and live performance by playing many shows up and down the west coast of Canada and the U.S.. Having the opportunity to open for such acts as Kreator, Destruction, Agent Orange, Dayglo Abortions, Strapping Young Lad and Dr. Know helped to fuel the growing Goler mania.

In early 2004, the Golers released their 2nd CD, aptly titled "2nd Generation". The album reveals a more polished, and yet more aggressive style than the first disc. With better production, heavier riffs and well thought out song structures, it still maintains the roots of their original style. From beginning to end, this CD will leave you beaten a pulp, with a grin on your face. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Golers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
