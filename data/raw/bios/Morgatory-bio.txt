Morgatory is a very brutal yet diverse band from Philadelphia,Pennsylvania(USA). Formed at the ages of 14, Morgatory started their professional music career in 1991.
Sad to say, Morgatory broke up due to serious problems among a few members.
The good news is that 2008 marks the return of one of Philadelphia's legendary band. Two founding members (Tom Larson/vocals,guitars and Jerry Herrmann/drums) are currently writing new material for an upcoming Morgatory late summer/fall release.
