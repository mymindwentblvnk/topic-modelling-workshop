As The Kingdom Falls is an American Deathcore band formed in Frederick, Maryland during the summer of 2006. With a final lineup finally established mid 2007, ATKF began playing shows and taking over the Metal scene around the Baltimore, Maryland area. Playing with many national bands such as Suicide Silence, Darkest Hour, Whitechapel, and Parkway Drive, the band quickly made a name for themselves. The band broke up in November of 2008 due to members of the band not sharing many of the same musical ideas. Several of the core members decided to start the band once again in late December 2009 and as of now the band is now writing new material and preparing to play shows in hopes to take over the scene once again!  The band plans on releasing their debut full length album, Approaching Armageddon later this year.
