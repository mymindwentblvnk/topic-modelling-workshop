About Us :
We are a casual band that always learn from our friends who are not exceptional unrelenting also provides exceptional support and some band that is also an inspiration to us. We never expected to become an artist even pretentious artist because we just want to make music, work honestly, to explore the potential of each character is maximal in each individual personnel, so as not to prostitute themselves in this country music prostitution business. And we always feel proud and arrogant because Indonesia could become metal heads though hard to become prosperous, also never give up to be defeated by circumstances because if not the beginning of each of us, who else who can do it
