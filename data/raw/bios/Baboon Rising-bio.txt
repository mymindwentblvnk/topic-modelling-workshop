Baboon Rising rose as Baboon in 1987. In 1995 after several albums they changed their name to Baboon Rising. For most of its existence it has had two members. One of the founding members, Thomas Miller moved leaving Mark Rathke to record the rest of the existing albums in the bands discography.

In 2000, "Lethal Liddy" was played on the G. Gordon Liddy Radio Show as one of the top 5 finalists for the show's first song contest. The show at the time was the second most listened to radio program, pulling in between 8 to 10 million listeners.

In 2004 and 2005, a heavy metal version of the Sledge Hammer! Theme was recorded and included on the DVDs. It was a great honor that the shows Creator/Producer Alan Spencer chose this version to be played during the menus of both seasons on DVDs.
