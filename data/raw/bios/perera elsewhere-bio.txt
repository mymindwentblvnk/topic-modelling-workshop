Perera Elsewhere is a pseudonym of Sasha Perera. Forged from the depths of London, eventually finding Berlin as her sanctuary, Perera summons lost souls and presage of tomorrow in her craft. Acting on instinct rather than mathematics, incorporating organic elements that compliment and co-exist with robotics, carefully reserving space for her haunting yet soothing vocal passes...these are the bricks and mortar of Perera's waking dreams. From the grit of dark club to the absorption of indigenous sounds & styles along her travels, Perera melds these inspirations into her own semi-acoustic, abstract and pop-tinged bliss. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Perera+Elsewhere">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
