Zoltan Gal as known as ICR is the founder of the hungarian electronic music scene's well respected home, ImpulseCreator - serving the drum and bass and urban music community for more than ten years. Besides his work as an editor and music journalist, dozens of releases proved that his artistic vein is fulled with musical variety and uncpompromising creativity. After releasing on various acclaimed labels, he started running his own imprint. Misspent Music lived two years, recruiting a group of like-minded producers, suppprting up and coming artists as well as giving an opportunity to show ICR's experimental side on full length albums. Meanwhile his interests of music turned from dnb to slower genres. With releases on Glack Audio, Sonorous Music, the ten-year old Chi Recordings and UK label Orson Records, he has already proved that his house, downtempo breaks and techno music is also worth to check. Recently a new, non dnb LP is forming under his creative hands, focusing on all styles aforementioned and beyond - from house to dubstep, or electronic hip hop to idm. The trademark deep and cinematic ICR sound remains the same, but in new forms. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ICR">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
