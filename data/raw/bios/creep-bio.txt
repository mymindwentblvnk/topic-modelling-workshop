1) World renowned DJ Lauren Flax has unveiled her new project with co-conspirator Lauren Dillard, the haunting new duo Creep. Flax is a veteran house DJ (and Fischerspooner’s tour DJ), and they listen to “a lot of classic house and old freestyle stuff,” Dillard says. But their sound skews pop. They’re very influenced by house and the UK bass scene, but at the same time their music is quite dreamy. Creep is a new project, and they’re still working on tracks, but have attracted some notable guest vocalists already, including Romy Madley Croft from the xx, NIna Sky, Holly Miranda and more.
