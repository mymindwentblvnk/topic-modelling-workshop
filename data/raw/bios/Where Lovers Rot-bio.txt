With a ghost-fingered grip on that brew of gothic doom glimpsed in the likes of My Dying Bride and Draconian, WHERE LOVERS ROT channel their melancholy forebears and breathe Portland, Oregon a refreshingly uncharacteristic wisp of primordial, symphonic doom metal.

Formed in late 2013 and releasing their debut demo a year later, Where Lovers Rot sees former Midnite Winter-vocalist Sara Fallico waft operatic spells atop a landscape of keys, haunting guitars, and progressively bipolar drums (via guitarist Vladimore and ex-Mortal Plague-members Eric Innes and Jason Borton on guitar and drums respectively), while bassist Brian Rush (Earthen, Mountain Grave, Terrestrial) retches sarcophagal growls into what can only be called an unsettling eleganceâ€¦the Anathama-colored ballet pirouetting on mediocrity's grave.
