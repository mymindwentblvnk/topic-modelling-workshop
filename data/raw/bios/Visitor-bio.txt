There is more than one band going by the name "Visitor":

1.) EBM\darkwave duo, made up of Philip Traikovski and Veronica Stefanuik originating out of Edmonton, Canada.

2.) London based pop duo consisting of Australians Kyle Gibson and Lucas Gianello, formerly Cobra Dukes, then formerly What She Wants - a sort of pop-hungry, high drama missing link between The Killers and the Pet Shop Boys.

3.) A Portland-based collaboration between Ilyas Ahmed & Liz Harris (Grouper). The duo have performed together on various occasions and released their first set of recordings as an EP on the Social Music Records label, run by fellow Portland music aficionado Mike Mcgonigal (of Yeti Magazine fame). The EP was released in a limited run and only available to subscribers of the annual music clubs release cycle.

4.) Thrash metal band

5.) Minnesota-based psychedelic doom rock band signed to Lighten Up Sounds <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Visitor">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
