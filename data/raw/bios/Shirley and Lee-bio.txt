Shirley Goodman (born Shirley Mae Goodman, 19 June 1936, New Orleans, Louisiana  – died 5 July 2005, Los Angeles, California) was an American R&B singer known best for Shirley and Lee, a 1950s R&B duo. Later in her career, she had a resurgence with the disco hit, "Shame, Shame, Shame" in the 1970s.\
After singing in church choirs, she recorded her first demo with a group of friends in 1950. Some months later, her solo voice  caught the attention of Aladdin Records owner Eddie Messner, who tracked her down and paired her as a duo with another school friend, Leonard Lee (29 June 1936 – 23 October 1976).

As 'Shirley & Lee', they recorded their debut single "I’m Gone", produced by Cosimo Matassa, which reached #2 on the Billboard R&B charts in 1952. The record contrasted Goodman’s soprano with Leonard's baritone, in a way in which subsequent songwriters have suggested was influential on the development of ska and reggae. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Shirley+and+Lee">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
