Atom (Adam Goren) created spastic, heartfelt, synthpunk anthems with a guitar and Casio synthesizer along with the help of his trusty sequencer, "Package". His intensely personal, in-joke-laden lyrics sound like scribblings from some much-xeroxed 'zine, while the music itself is often irresistibly catchy. 

Atom played his final show in August 2003, and is now a member of the bands Armalite. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Atom+and+His+Package">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
