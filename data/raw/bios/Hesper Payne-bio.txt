Hesper Payne is a death doom band from Newcastle upon Tyne on the north east coast of England.
Hesper take their lyrical inspiriation from the works of H.P. lovecraft et al and northern english mythology and folklore, weaving elements of both together to create a unique world of their own. Formed in 2004 by Vocalist / Guitarist Brooke Johnson and Bassist Ian Fenwick, Hesper have released a number of EPâ€™s though struggling to find a full lineup has kept live activities to a minimum. Every aspect of recording and art is self produced. 

Current line-up:
Ian Fenwick - Bass
Richard Pickman - Studio drums
Brooke Johnson - Guitar, vocals, keys

Discography:
Dreamer in the deep EP 2006 (Re-released in 2007 with on extra demo track)
Titans of the North sea - EP 2008
Relics of the Deep Dark Woods - Compilation 2009 of demo and unreleased tracks
