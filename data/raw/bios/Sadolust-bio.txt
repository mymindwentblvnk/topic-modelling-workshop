In the middle of 1997 "Sadolust" band started it's first steps with Terrys. There were various members. In 2000 album "Helljam" recorded. In 2005 Primordial took over the lead percussions and Schuriken the lead guitars and "Violent Fetish" was recorded with 12 tracks included and Terrys screaming his lungs out. At 2006 mini demo was released "Whorehouse Production" with 3 tracks following the Unholy Triad: Terrys / Primordial / Schuriken crawl down bitter.

Sadolust has always been shunned and despised by other black metal bands and forbid to play at the live clubs in Athens, Greece because of the extremity of the music vocals and drums set and the S&M Antichristian show that Sadolust performs onstage.

Sadolust continues to record live LP's at the studio up to this very day and new releases will be available through Amduscias Records net label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sadolust">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
