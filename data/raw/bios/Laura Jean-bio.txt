Laura Jean (born Laura Jean Englert,) is an Australian musician from Melbourne, Victoria. She is known for her classically inspired folk songs, often using a range of orchestral instruments.

She has been gracing Australian stages for many years. Invitations to share them have come from overseas artists such as Mark Kozelek (ex-Red House Painters) Richard Buckner, M. Ward, Faun Fables, Tuck and Patti, and Australian acts like Augie March, Ben Lee, Claire Bowditch, Machine Translations, Gaslight Radio, and Sarah Blasko.

Her first E.P, 'The Hunter's Ode' (2003) was embraced by community radio and street press across the country, as well as Triple J. The title track is apparently still sometimes heard late at night. It's been two years since a release, but rest assured activity rarely ceased behind the scenes. After securing an Arts Victoria recording grant in July 2004, Laura's vision for her debut album became closer to reality... Chamber orchestras don't come cheap! The results appeared in Laura Jean's debut album "Our Swan Song". The first single from this, 'I'm a Rabbit, I'm a Fox', proved popular on community radio Australia wide and recieved medium rotation on JJJ. Rumor has it that it is still heard late at night over the airwaves.

Laura Jean and friends (the Eden Land Band, plus the Haunting Bird Choir at times) released a second album, "Eden Land", early in 2008 at the Corner Hotel. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Laura+Jean">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
