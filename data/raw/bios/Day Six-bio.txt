DAY SIX grown to be one of the most well known progressive metal bands in the Netherlands. Day Six makes progressive rock, heavily influenced by various other musical genres like symfo, funk and every now and then even jazz. In addition to these influences, the band doesn't shy away from experiments with sounds and samples. 

The band has been compared with established bands like RUSH, PINK FLOYD and DEEP PURPLE, as well as more recent groups as OPETH and DREAM THEATER. 

In October 2003 Day Six released their debut album ETERNAL DIGNITY in the Netherlands. Every sound and instrumentation to be heard on this album has been carefully considered and the result is definitely something for the band to be proud of! When performing live, Day Six will even go a step further by using in their performance the same samples that can be heard on the album. The performance itself is one of the most remarkable aspects. "Awesome" and "Incredible" are the most common reactions heard from the audience after a performance by Day Six. 

2004 has been a very successful year for the band, being the winners of two big competitions in the Netherlands: the METALBATTLE and the METAL BASH. The price consisted of several days recording time in a professional studio. The band gratefully used this time to record their demo for the next album. This demo contains two tracks, which are part of the concept album of the band. 

At present the band is engaged in the creative process to record this upcoming new album. The album is going to be mixed and mastered by Jochem Jacobs (Textures) and it will be released somewhere in 2007.
