Simultaneously street and country with an elastic, no-nonsense flow, Yella Beezy represents the Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas, Texas. Active since the early 2010s, he has released several mixtapes, including Lil Yella Mane (2012), Country Rap Tunes (2015), Lite Work (2015), and Broke Nights Rich Days (2017). The second volume of Lite Work (also 2017) featured "That's on Me," a track with a video viewed well over four million times within four months of release. Beezy's momentum continued with the March 2018 upload of an official clip for the Lil Baby collaboration "Up One," another track off Lite Work, Vol. 2. Its views exceeded 1.5 million in less than a week.  His full-length, 2018's Ain't No Goin' Bacc, hit the top half of the Billboard 200 album chart.

In October of that year, the rapper was the victim of a drive-by shooting that left him briefly hospitalized after sustaining three gunshot wounds. Even this traumatic event didn't slow his momentum, and he recovered quickly to sign with indie label HITCO, Beezy and release Ain't No Goin' Bacc in November. The release included a star-studded version of "That's on Me" featuring 2 Chainz, T.I., Jeezy, and others. By the summer of 2019, Beezy had surpassed the billion-times-played mark across all streaming platforms. On the back of this landmark he released the Baccend Beezy mixtape, another strong collection of dark and booming Southern rap with guest stars ranging from Young Thug to Too Short. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yella+Beezy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
