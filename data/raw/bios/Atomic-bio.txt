8) DJ 4T4, Belgium´s most prominent hip hop protagonist, dons his red cape, grabs a mic and takes it to the stage on this not-so-recently released Kinky Star outing. 4T4 is known and respected for his work on a number of local releases and his quality music trademark shows once again in 'The Last Idealist'. Fusing 80s pop and electro with psychedelica and hip hop, he creates a crisply produced and interesting musical kaleidoscope. Some funny tricks and a healthy dose of self´relativation; ex-Evil Superstar Mauro makes a cameo appearance, as well as DJ Grazzhoppa, MC's TLP, Tirrence Hell and some others. If you dig the sounds of the Belgian hop, this one's more than worth checking out.

9) A korean hip-hop/rap project.

10) A drum and bass/drumstep artist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Atomic">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
