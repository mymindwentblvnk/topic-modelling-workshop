Aeon Arcanum is a Macedonian metal act that tends to incorporate every piece of their songs into a progressively developed music flow. 

The unified association of various types of instruments is what makes their music complex, but yet composed and arranged in such a way that brings psychedelic and melancholic moments in one context.

The band was formed in the year 2003 by Aleksandar Ivanov and firstly known by the name Arcanum. After many band members settings, Aeon Arcanum grew in variety in the musical sense as the band filtered its music taste. 

There were two demos of the band that were recorded before the official release of their first album named Monuments. The band is now composed from the following instruments/band members:

Aleksandar Ivanov - Vocals, Guitars, Acoustic Guitars, Electronics & noises, Synths, Tambura
Dragan Teodosiev - Drums, Percussions, Backing Vocals, Noises
Darko Avramovski - Bass

Session Members:
Andrej Karadzoski - Guitars
