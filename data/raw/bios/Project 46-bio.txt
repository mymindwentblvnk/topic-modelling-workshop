Project 46 is a duo consisting of Tman Shaw & Ryan Henderson, who actually live 4,500km apart from each other. Calling Vancouver and Waterloo their homes respectively, Project 46 doesnâ€™t foresee any hindrances producing with such a dividing distance. With the advent of Skype and cloud computing, more and more long distance production teams are sprouting up around the world.
They have currently released one EP (Featuring 3 original tracks; Limitless, Slide, and Crazy) on Beatport and various digital download sites via the Monstercat Media label.
