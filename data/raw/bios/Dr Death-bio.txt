Doctor Death are a combination of discarded hospital waste and the spilt blood of convicted paedophiles. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but when a meteorite struck the waste/blood mix it irradiated it with "Space Energy". 

What emerged from this mess were four life forms, all gifted with razor sharp doctor's minds and the unbearable desire to do very nasty things to children. 

So they did whatever any newly created life forms would do, form a thrash band.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Dr+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
