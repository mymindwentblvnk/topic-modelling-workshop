Technical brutal death metal band from Czechia.

Godless Truth was founded in 1994. The line-up was different from the current one and they recorded 'Another Disease' (1994) demo and 'Desperation' (1996) album which was released on tape at first. They recorded also two-song promo which was later added as a bonus for CD version of 'Desperation'. Then big line-up changes came. In 97/98 all the band members were kicked out, only Petr (g) remained and Zdenek, the band's manager at that time, became a new singer.
