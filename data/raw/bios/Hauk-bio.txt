The relentlessly driving force behind Hauk is its frontman, who goes by the same name. Drawing on lengthy and far-ranging musical experience, and taking dictation from Odin himself, Hauk writes songs that are deeply spiritual and unique in their genre-defying vision. The rest of the band complement and further this vision. Hauk and drummer Chris Dooly first played together in the folk-metal band Mythreal. Dooly’s intense, tribal drumming has become a trademark of the Hauk sound. Canadian pianist Duke Dubeau, nephew of virtuoso violinist Angele Dubeau brings a majestic keyboard sound while maintaining a rock sensibility. Boyd Ervin, the latest addition to the band, adds bass to the band’s foundation as well as the soaring lead guitar that provides a spiritual uplift to Hauk’s sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hauk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
