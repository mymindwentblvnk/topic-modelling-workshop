June Marieezy is a singer-songwriter from Dallas, Texas who is now residing in Manila, Philippines since 2008. Manila's underground indie scene challenged her RnB style to a burst of genres from rock, soul, jazz, and experimental. 

Since 2008, she has been in an alternative rock band called Good Morning High Fives. 

Manila's culture itself has a big impact on June's writing influences while she falls in love with her country, learns how to cope with the dirty city, and alternatively sips on coconut juice on the surreal islands. 

However, a girl from the south of the metro simply cannot be satisfied without her soul and hip hop roots. That is where she calls home to Deeper Manila.
