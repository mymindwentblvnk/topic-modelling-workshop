3. D provided vocals to the song World with me on the Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II video game soundtrack. Due to inconsistencies in the Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II and Phantasy Star Online Episode III C.A.R.D. Revolution soundtracks booklets (D being only credited in the latter one), D is believed to be the same person as LOREN, who performed the opening and ending songs to the first Phantasy Star Online game, but there is no reliable source to confirm or deny such information. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/D">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
