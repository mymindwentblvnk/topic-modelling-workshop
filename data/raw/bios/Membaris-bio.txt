Black Metal band from Germany (Hesse) with three full lengths.

  The spawn called Membaris was born on October the 18th 1999. Till this day the sedulous ambition of this band was to compose music of the deepest human emotions that emerge from the existance in the post modern, capitalistic and, so to speak, virtual world. Membaris, in the true essence, is Black Metal, nothing more-nothing less. After the early days, when occultism and certain anti-christian and oppositional concepts dominated the genesis of this collective, Membaris today write the soundtrack for their personal, yet meditative, experiences on this earth. Above all was and ever will be the will to create tunes of hatred, pride and beauty.
