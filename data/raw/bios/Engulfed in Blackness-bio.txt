Engulfed in Blackness was formed on January 7, 2013 by former members of the cult band Malignant Christ and quickly eclipsed it's predecessor in both quality and reputation. After several lineup changes and the release of two demos in 2013 the band signed with Pagan Pride Records and released it's debut album, "Ceremonial Equinox", in March 2014. The band's lineup has since solidified around Brandon Von (also of Thy Hideous Wake) with continued assistance and encouragement from Brian Kelley (also of Oakmoon).
