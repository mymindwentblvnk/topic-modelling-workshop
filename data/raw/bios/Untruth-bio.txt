Untruth are a Heavy Metal band from the Mornington Peninsula, about an hour south of Melbourne, Australia. Drawing influence from artists such as In Flames, Machine Head, Mors Principium Est, Dark Tranquillity, Soilwork and The Black Dahlia Murder to name a few, they are certainly a band to keep an eye on as they continue to build a solid following. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Untruth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
