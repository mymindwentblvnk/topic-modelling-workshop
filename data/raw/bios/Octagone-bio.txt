OCTAGONE is an industrial death metal act hailing from Pilsen, Czech Republic. Formerly known as a grindcore band, Octagone changed the musical direction later on to pursue different goals in music. Despite solid death metal and even eurothrash roots of the band, samples and industrial elements are also frequently incorporated to the final product. The first album "Proelium" (2011) was released via Radiation Noise Productions. The 2nd full-length release entitled "Atratus: The Pendulum" follows the debut in 2014.
