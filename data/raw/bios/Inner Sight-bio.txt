Inner Sight originally formed in 1998 when brothers Mati and Javi Regueira met Ros and decide to build up some metal songs influenced by different bands such as In Flames, Dimmu Borgir or Blind Guardian (yes... powermetal was in its glory days that time!). In 2004 Rosello and Jaume fill in for drums and vocals respectively and record their first demo cd called "Reaching Surface". In 2006 after a change in drums another 3-track demo was recorded. In 2008 they recorded an auto-edited LP "Arbitrariness of Natural Calamity" containing 11 tracks plus a videoclip. The same year vocalist Jaume M. left and Alex union with the band marks Inner Sight's latest addition.
