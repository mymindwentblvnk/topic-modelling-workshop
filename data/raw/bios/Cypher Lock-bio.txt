Cypher Lock is a four piece melodic death metal band from West Virginia. We started out as a three piece in 2008 but didnt start to get things going till the adddition of Hallie in 2009. We are just four friends who are striving to get our music heard by anyone who will listen. We have been very grateful to play with a handful of world touring bands. To name a few: Epica,Leaves' Eyes,Primal Fear,Blackguard and Firewind. Cypher lock is ready to give the music scene a breathe of new life. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cypher+Lock">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
