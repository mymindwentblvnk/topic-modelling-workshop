2) Formed in 2002 in Fife, Scotland, Warstone were originally known as "Black Steel". However, an Australian band of the same name threatened legal action if the name wasn't changed, and thus Warstone were born.

A promising young metal act, plagued by misfortune of Spinal Tap proportions, the band managed to release three EPs of varying styles. In 2005, however, they disbanded, ironically very soon after gaining more credibility than ever before.
