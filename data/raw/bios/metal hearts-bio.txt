Anar Badalov now plays with former Victory at Sea member Mona Elliott as Travels (www.last.fm/music/Travels). Flora can be found at www.myspace.com/meflora. 

Metal Hearts feature multi-instrumentalists Anar Badalov and Flora Wolpert-Checknoff. Once enemies in high school, Badalov and Wolpert-Checknoff internalized such animosity for a competitive, creative relationship. Both started writing songs during college. Badalov was attending Rhode Island College in Providence while Wolpert-Checknoff was studying at Concordia University in Montreal. Once back in their native Baltimore, the brooding indie rock duo came together in early 2004 with programmer Sam Leiber. Socialize marked the Metal Hearts' debut release for Suicide Squeeze in February 2006.
