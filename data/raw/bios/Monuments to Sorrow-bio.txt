This name can refer to one of 4 things:

1) An oregon-based screamo/ambient band with members Mark Schaffer and Lars Palfrey
2) A tennessee based thrash metal band from 1994 who broke up after releasing one demo.
3) A texas based drone/funeral doom band 
4) testicles

The fourth began in 2006 when Chris Spynalson met a likeminded fan of uncreativity, himself. After some jam sessions they decided to record a single which became a radio hit. Well, to be more precise, it was originally a radio-hit that Spynalson slowed down in the freeware program Audacity to far beyond unlistenable extremes. He called this song "Ground 00." Asked in an interview why he named it this, Spynalson responded:

"Die in a fire."

Monuments to Sorrow later broke up after a very violent argument between the members.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Monuments+To+Sorrow">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
