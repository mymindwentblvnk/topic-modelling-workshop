Formed in November 2006, teenage fury Under The Grave was quick to shake the Montréal metal scene with its ferocious sounds and energetic stage shows. Sounds like any other Metal band? Think again... These metalheads are still in their teens yet already breathing hard down the necks of the older guard.


They played their first show ever on January 27th 2007, early on the bill of a festival at the famous Montréal venue Club Soda. This performance took the audience by surprise and got them tons of fans, both curious and astonished to see such a young crew produce such a mature sound..


With their roots strongly planted in classics like Hypocrisy, Sepultura, Kataklysm, Vehemence and Quo Vadis, their music is a highly potent mix of Death, Thrash and Black Metal that brings a modern twist and a new energy to the genre. Electrifying solos, catchy riffs, melodic bass, brutal beats and an increadible array of vocals will blow your minds and ears. Under The Grave is a name to remember..


Their debut album, Until Death Takes Us All, masterminded by Jef Fortin from Canadian thrash icons Anonymus, is an incredible showcase of musicianship, crafty composition and ripping, Swedish-sounding production. A very solid debut from a band that will haunt you for years to come..
