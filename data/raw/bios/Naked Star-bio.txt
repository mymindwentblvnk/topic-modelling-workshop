On 01/02/11 Hour Of 13 released the song "Naked Star" on an EP for the Metal Magazine, The Metal Hammer. Meanwhile, Ahren Troutman's failed death metal project, Thousand Cunt Island folded as a result of no-shows from fellow band members. Mid-January, Ahren decided to start his own project, but as a soloist (influenced by his Idols Cemetery Rapist, Putrid Pile, Force-fed Human Shit, etc.). Late January, this idea festered in his brain, while he continued talking about his near non-existent project. Avast! the EP arrived with his monthly magazine and as he listened to the many artists he heard "Naked Star". The song captivated him, he had never heard a more beautiful doom metal song in his life. In February of the next year, as he was walking to his workplace, The song came on shuffle and he and his co-workers constantly talked about the idea of him becoming a soloist. 
In March of 2012, after forming a friendship with noise artist and producer, Pory Nog, he decided to make his project and call it Naked Star as a reference to the song that influenced him. Later that year, Naked Star signed to NOG Records and released a crappy single labeled "Splatter On The Windshield Of Life". This got him a tiny fanbase. 
On June of that year Naked released an EP independently titled Anniversary Of An Ultraviolent Affair. This song featured 5 tracks (including his most popular song, "Death By RuRu"). This went for 5$ and is now currently free to download. In August of 2012, Naked Star released a free EP titled "I Want To Confront Steve" which featured clips from the Steve Wilkos Show. Naked Star has recorded many songs with Seagulls Fucking Seagulls (a harsh noise project featuring Pory Nog). Only one of these was ever officially released and It is titled "Bailbait". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Naked+Star">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
