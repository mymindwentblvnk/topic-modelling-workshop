SHOTGUN SLUDGE represents alcohol infused Heavy style Southern, Stoner and Sludge based music and they have recently started to compose faster.
As from a point of view from band members and the audience; the concerts contain strong language and excessive alcohol in the matter of enjoyment and violence; such as the guitarist Orn's return from the Dimebag Rememberance Night concert with broken ribs. 
The concerts are not suggested to decent people generally. But if you think you are a tough person saying "I won't let go of my booze and my smoke, I'll go into the mosh pit and pogo", think Southern, Stoner and Sludge music is awesome and you happen to like Chuck Norris movies too, well.... these concerts are what you have been waiting for all along!!
For unlimited alcohol, unlimited Southern metal and Sludge music you've come to the right address with SHOTGUN SLUDGE!
