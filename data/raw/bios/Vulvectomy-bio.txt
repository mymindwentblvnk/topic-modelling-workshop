Vulvectomy is an Italian slam death metal band.

They formed on January 2007 by the will of Diego Fanelli, already singer of Stench of Disemberment and Natron, with the intent to create a project devote of playing total  brutal slam, mainly influenced by Devourment, Inhuman Dissiliency and Cephalotripsy  mixed with grind parts. The degenerative process was transmitted from Diego (vox) to Mario Di Giambattista of Endaemona and Putrid Dismemberment from Rome as guitar who joined the band on May of 2007.

Vulvectomy has never had a drummer. Some drummers were auditioned in the band's early days, but ultimately Vulvectomy decided that finding a full time committed drummer was too much trouble. All live performances and recordings have always been done with a drum program.

Vulvectomy has released three albums and one demo. They are one of the leading acts in Italy's death metal scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vulvectomy">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
