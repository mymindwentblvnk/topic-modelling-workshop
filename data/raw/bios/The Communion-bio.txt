THE COMMUNION's caustic blend of savage black metal, urgent hardcore, nightmarish lyrics, and bleak showmanship has slowly been making waves in the NY underground since 2004. THE COMMUNION has made it a point to be D.I.Y.; self releasing two demos (2005's Well Played, Illuminati and 2007's Nihilism is for Lovers, the later of which was recently reviewed in METAL MANIACS), nabbing features in several underground publications, and playing numerous shows (much of them booked by Lee Altomare, one of the group's two guitarists) up and down the east coast, sharing the stage with the likes of BRUTAL TRUTH, MACABRE, ISKRA, RAW RADAR WAR, SALOME, DARKSIDE NYC, DEATHCYCLE, NEGATIVE REACTION, RWAKE, BLOODY PANDA, ASRA, UNEARTHLY TRANCE, INFERNAL STRONGHOLD and others. 2009 is poised to be THE COMMUNION's biggest year, with several anticipated vinyl releases ready to go in the winter; a split 10" w/ DELLIN MULLER on REFORMED RECORDS, a split 7" w/ COMPOUND TERROR on MIDNIGHT SEA RECORDS/JUST SAY NO RECORDS, and some high profile shows. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Communion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
