3) Quench was a UK Christian rock act. Their eponymous first EP contained mostly rock worship material, and included the song 'Alright', which went on to be featured on their album 'Afterglow' (2003), which was made up of much more performance-orientated, radio friendly rock songs, but with the same God-centred heart, and was universally well received by Christian broadcasters.

The band decided to call it a day in 2009, playing their final gig at Greenbelt Festival.
