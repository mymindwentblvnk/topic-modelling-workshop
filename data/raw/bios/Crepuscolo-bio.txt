The Crepuscolo was born in 1995 in Italy in a basement of an old building in a small city, Macerata. After a first organization, in 1996 the band has recorded a couple of songs appeared in various national compilation cds. After some years “into the pit”, the original line-up lost two elements. The other two decided to go on andaunted, following their aspirations and signed up the great singer Karl “Lu Lercio”. The new formation esperimented their music and recorded a demo tape and many other songs that are still now inedit. This experience was useful to forge their sound and their idea of music. Crepuscolo, not satisfied of the resoults they got till that moment, decided to come back with a new line-up. They recorded the last Promo CD in Oct/Nov 2010 and they started with live gigs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crepuscolo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
