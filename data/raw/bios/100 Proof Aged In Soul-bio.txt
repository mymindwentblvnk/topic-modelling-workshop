100 Proof (Aged in Soul) was a funk/soul group formed in Detroit, Michigan in 1969. Put together by Motown songwriting team Holland-Dozier-Holland, they signed to Hot Wax Records and went on to release several hit singles between 1969 and 1972. The biggest of these, "Somebody's Been Sleeping", reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100. This disc sold over one million copies, and received a gold disc awarded by the R.I.A.A..

They broke up in 1973, although the name was re-used for a totally different line-up of musicians for a short period in 1977.
