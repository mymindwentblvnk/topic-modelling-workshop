There is more than one band performing under this name.

(1) A Stoner Rock/Doom band from Yorkshire, featuring ex members of Khang/Lazarus Blackstar.

(2) Threads is a slovak progressive rock band from Poprad. The band formed in 2007 as a fullfilled dream of two beginning guitarists, Tomáš Hrábek and Tomáš Sagula, who are schoolmates.

(3) A Melodic Hardcore band from West Virginia, USA. http://threadswv.bandcamp.com

Their music combines classic hard rock style with psychedelic stuff. On Friday, 21st December 2007 they have recorded their first promo album meant for meditation called Inner Waves. It is also a present for their girlfriends interested in rock music.

(4) The Portland based duo Threads is comprised of members Barbara Kinzle (The Slaves, Oregon Painting Society) on voice and guitar, and Aaron Davis (Acre, EMA, Lords of Lightspeed) on bass and drum machine. Threads' dense, guitar heavy sound is not a complete deviation from the duo's drone-like history as is in the case with Acre and The Slaves, two different takes of an ambient, long form musical style. While their songs still maintain a similar minimalist edge, the introduction of beats and more upfront vocals create a brooding concoction of shredded pop bliss. (Debacle Records)
