There are two bands called Narcissus.
1. Narcissus was an influential American hardcore band formed by John LaRussa and John Pope in 1998 in Cleveland, Ohio. Not counting John LaRussa and John Pope, who were in the band from start to finish, members included, at various times, Justin Carroll (bass), Ray Taylor (guitar), Derek Carter (percussion), Stephen Cushman (percussion) and Josh King (bass). The band was on the now-defunct label Takehold Records before joining Century Media. A few albums were re-released through Tooth and Nail. Before breaking up the band were featured on The Vans Warped tour and were getting ready to hit Europe for their international release of Crave and Collapse, which was received well over seas. The band has been considered highly influential for their progressive and inventive style of hardcore and rock. When the band broke up in 2003, John LaRussa went on to form Inhale Exhale with Brian Pittman, a former member of Relient K. There has been rumors of a reunion that's surfaced from time to time, but nothing official.
2. Narcissus is a contemporary belgian jazz project, involving Robin Verheyen( tenor- & soprano sax), Harmen Fraanje (piano), Clemens van der Feen (double bass) and Flin van Hemmen (drums) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Narcissus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
