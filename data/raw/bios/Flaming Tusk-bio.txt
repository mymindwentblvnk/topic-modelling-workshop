Flaming Tusk practices a thousand acts in honor of the dark ones a day in Astoria, Queens, New York City. This unholy quintet plays a complex combination of extreme metal: the elements of this elaborate mix include characteristics of sludge, progressive metal, and black metal.

Flaming Tusk's debut work, Abigail, was released from the underworld on October 16, 2008. It is available as a free-of-charge EP on the band's official site, www.flamingtusk.com. In September of 2009, Flaming Tusk headed to the East Coast's citadel of evil, the city of Hoboken, NJ, to record their first studio album with Tom Beaujour of Nuthouse Recording. The result: Old, Blackened Century, which was released on the dark day of January 19, 2010 as a pay-what-you-want download.

In September of 2010, guitarist Don Blood left the band, but the ancient rites summoned Bernard Gann of Liturgy, who agreed to fill the void and help continue Flaming Tusk's reign of terror.

Flaming Tusk comprises:

Bernard Gann — Lead Guitar 
Zosimus — Guitar 
Schneidaar — Bass Guitar  
Stolas Trephinator — Vocals
