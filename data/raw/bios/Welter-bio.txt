Viking Metal from the Netherlands with Krieger (also in Necrofeast) as sole member. Welter's one and only demo was the self-released Als het licht vervalt in 1997. An album was produced a year later in 1998, entitled The Elder Land.

The Elder Land was released under Berzerker Records. It features a cover of the track Friesche Viking by Black Art and a cover of Mourning Soul by Absurd.  

Welter's lyrical themes deal primarily with Frisian/Dutch paganism.
