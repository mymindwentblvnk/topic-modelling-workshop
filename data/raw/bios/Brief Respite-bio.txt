The members of Brief Respite met in the summer of 2003 at Mont-tremblant. At that moment, the band was formed of four members and was named "Les mauvais clowns". It was a heavy metal band. After the loss of Yan, the singer and guitarist, two new members entered the band. The arrival of the singer Luc Giguère and Eric Barbe on the guitar brought a new black metal style to their music. The band then reworked some projects that were later named Lullaby to the Moon, Shattered Glass and Good Against Bad. They also readapted old songs to Luc's voice. Order by chaos was composed for a contest at the Cyclone bar in Ste-marthe sur le Lac (Qc). It was on the 27th of december 2003 and the show was a 45 minute success for the judges and the group.The birth of the songs Last war and Passing the gate in 2004 was a revelation for the band and revealed the true style of Brief Respite. This was followed by the recording of a demo album at studio Mordicus in Ste-Agathe des monts. With the help of Donald Fleurant (Nouzôte, Talisma) ten tracks were taped for a total of 60 minutes. This album was later named Lullaby to the Moon. In the summer of 2004, Stephane, the bassist, left the band and was replaced by Steve Coutemanche. More experienced, Steve now brings a new dimension to the bass tracks in Brief Respite. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brief+Respite">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
