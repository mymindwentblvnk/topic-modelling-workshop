Arakain is a czech heavy metal/hard rock band. Originally  founded in 1982 in Prague,  Czech Republic. 

The band could not release their own records due to censorship of communist regime in Czechoslovakia. That's why their first album "Thrash the trash" wasn't released until 1990. Songs from "communist era" were released later on double CD "A15 (vol. 1 & 2)" in 1997 and "Archeology" in 2002. Czech pop star Lucie Bílá appears as a guest on this record, she had cooperated with Arakain in the 1980's.

Regarding the band's line-up - there's a stable trio Jirka Urban and Mirek Mach on guitars together with Zdeněk Kub on bass. Frontman and drumer's position has come through lots of changes in past few years.
When Aleš Brichta left the band in 2002, he was replaced by till that day almost unknown Petr Kolář, who recorded 2 albums with the band (Metalmorfoza 2003 and Warning! 2004). But in 2005 Petr Kolář started his own career (right after releasing the record Warning! and in the beggining of a tour) and was replaced by another singer Honza Toužimský.

Together with Petr Kolář also their longtime drummer Marek Žežulka has left the band for full time drumming in Divokej Bill. During the 2005 Warning tour were drums played by Roman Lomtadze, but it was only a temporary replacement, because Roman if fully engaged in folk rock band Čechomor. For the next record Labyrint Arakain found new drummer Lukáš Doxa Doksanský. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arakain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
