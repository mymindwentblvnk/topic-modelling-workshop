Ulcus Molle is the old name of Norwegian symphonic black metal band Ulcus, who released 2 demos and an EP using the Ulcus Molle name, before shortening it in 1999.

Ulcus split up in 2001, after releasing one full lenght album, and all band members became involved with Windir.

After the death of Windir frontman Terje "Valfar" Bakken in 2004, Windir was put on ice, and the former Ulcus/Ulcus Molle crew set out to form Vreid and Cor Scorpii. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ulcus+Molle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
