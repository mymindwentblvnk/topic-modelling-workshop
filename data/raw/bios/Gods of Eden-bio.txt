Gods of Eden are a band pushing the limits of creativity and technical ability. Starting out as the solo project of guitarist Danni Perez in 2010, the band has developed into a full five piece line up that combines a fanatic love of heavy metal with an alternative view of modern society’s dystopian ideals.

The band’s music is rich, layered and full of nuance. This is accentuated and amplified by the addition of acoustic guitars, orchestras and electronic soundscapes to create something larger than can be attained through traditional means. 
Each song varies from intense and overbearing to sweet and intoxicating, combined with lyrics that explore concepts and theories of the truth that lies behind the veil of our modern existence.
