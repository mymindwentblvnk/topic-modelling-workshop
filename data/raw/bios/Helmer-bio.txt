1) Helmer is Daniel Helmer (or DP Helmer), producer/musician from NYC. 

Since 2011 Helmer has honed his technical approach in making and performing dance floor-oriented musical expression as one-half of techno duo Sycorax. Helmerâ€™s solo project aims to craft intricate sound choreography with tracks that present a finely hewn aggressive edge while exploring new methods and technology. By expanding beyond the more traditional techno palette, Helmer utilizes found sounds and various synthesis techniques, all the while maintaining focus on moving the dance floor.
