There are two bands that go by the name Spillage

1) Formed in the arse end of Cricklewood in the same block of flats as the Goodies, Spillage stumbled around Camden in the mid 90s paddling like tipsy geese in a sea of Britpop filth. They released two singles, both of which were on vinyl only on Fortunate / Free Money Records. STICKETY BONE/RECIPE PAGE/POOR QUALITY FACIAL TATTOO was first, sold out quickly and then KILLER/FIVE ALIVE/MOUSTACHIOED PORN STAR was the second release, providing them with a trip to Abbey Road studios, a couple of offers of dubious record deals, Kerrang single of the week, day and nightime Radio 1 broadcasts, XFM single of the week, and John Peel's 'favourite song' of 1997. All of which were nice, but didn't provide cider tokens and they split in a cloud of poverty to concentrate on never being in a band ever again in 1998, citing 'musical similarities'...

2) Hailing from Chicago, Illinois and taking the best qualities of early Judas Priest & Uriah Heep, and mixing it with Uli Jon Roth era Scorpions, and a good dose of Chicago doom, Spillage manages to create brilliant, original music that stands well on its own in today's heavy scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spillage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
