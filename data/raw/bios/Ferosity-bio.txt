The band was started by Piotrek, Marek i Tomek in 1999. Endless problems with completion of full band members set, caused that the band was only a studio project for a couple of years.

In 2005, Sebastian and Pawe≈Ç joined the band and it was the real beginning. In 2006 we recorded our first CD, we also started to play live gigs. In 2007 "Overthrown Divinity" was professionally released by REDRUM666 label.

In december 2008 we recorded second album - "Primordial Cruelty". It is now released (again) by REDRUM666.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ferosity">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
