1) ZOIC are a Leicester, UK based band usually linked to the Chaotic Hardcore scene, whilst taking pride in writing without genre or social status limitations as a rule. Forming in the later portion of 2017, the group would quickly disband soon after the release of the Vol. 1: The Book of Herman EP in 2018 due to unstated reasons, however the project was picked back up by the summer of that same year.
