Seventh Angel is a thrash/doom metal band from Netherton, UK, that formed in 1987. Their first two releases, The Torment (1990), and Lament for the Weary (1991) were distributed through the label "Music for Nations" making them label mates with bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer, and were considered by many at the time to be one best metal acts in the United Kingdom. They were one of the few bands to combine elements of doom and thrash metal. The band headlined the Metal Meltdown festival in 1990, played concerts in Germany and Holland, and they were featured in both Channel 4 and BBC TV for several live performances of their Greenbelt festival concerts.

Seventh Angel disbanded in 1992 then announced their reforming on May 23, 2008, followed by the release of their third album, The Dust Of Years in 2009, in which the band progressed from Christian to more neutral lyrics, and included notable death metal influences to their sound, influenced by other projects of Ian Arkley's such as the death/doom bands My Silent Wake and Ashen Mortality.
