This project will be the core of Kyle Stanfield's personal expression.  While his other solo projects Übermensch and Kunikos are focused on his personal expression, it's only on one aspect for each - his misanthropic philosophy (Übermensch) and cynical nature (Kunikos).  With this project, he deals with everything in his life - things like his mental illness (schizophrenia (chronic, disorganized type), generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and derealization disorder), his life, and more in-depth in his own personal thought that doesn't fit in with Übermensch or Kunikos.
