Pelvic Meatloaf is a Groove metal band from Phoenix, Arizona, and was formed in November of 1990. Rather than conform to the will of a record label or try to impress others, Pelvic has chosen to remain independent.

If you come see Pelvic Meatloaf in concert, expect a high energy performance and a violent mosh pit, fueled by the most brutally hardcore, groove-based metal you've ever heard.

There is a reason that Pelvic Meatloaf is still together after 20 years. Its because we do what we love, and we do it the way WE wanna do it... Not for some label, or management company, or radio station.

While others talk the talk, we walk the walk. Skull crushing metal that makes you wanna punch a baby in its stupid fuckin face! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pelvic+Meatloaf">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
