38 Special is an American rock band. Formed by vocalist Donnie Van Zant in 1975 in Jacksonville, Florida, the band initially had a straight-ahead Southern rock sound, much like Lynyrd Skynyrd, the band of his older brother Ronnie. By the early 1980s, the band began incorporating elements of blues rock, pop rock, and arena rock into their sound, kicking off a string of successful albums and singles.

Among 38 Special's best-known songs are "Caught Up in You" (1982) and "If I'd Been the One" (1983), both of which hit #1 on Billboard magazine's album rock chart, as well as "Second Chance" (1989), a #1 hit on Billboard's adult contemporary chart. According to Songfacts, it was the biggest Adult Contemporary hit of 1989. Other popular singles include "Hold On Loosely" (1981),  "Fantasy Girl" (1981), "Back Where You Belong" (1984), and "Somebody Like You" (1986). These and other tracks are often played on classic rock radio stations.

After achieving three platinum albums and one gold album in the 80s, their popularity waned over the 90s-- although their 1997 single "Fade to Blue" hit #37 on the mainstream rock chart. More recently, the group's music came back into prominence after being featured in the 2001 cult classic comedy film 'Super Troopers', with songs such as "Trooper With An Attitude". They continue to tour to audiences in the American south and beyond.

The current lineup is comprised of vocalist Donnie Van Zant, guitarists Don Barnes and Danny Chauncey, bassist Larry Junstrom, keyboardist Bobby Capps, and drummer Gary Moffatt. Recently, both Donnie Van Zant and little brother Johnnie (the current frontman of Lynyrd Skynyrd) have joined forces as Van Zant and have released an album with another in the works. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/.38+Special">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
