OUM SHATT perform a radically pure and minimal form of rock'n'roll, with arabic references.
It's a deep and dark analog dance construct, percussive and nonchalant, based on Jonas Poppe's intense voice and the slow and deep surf guitar sound and electronic connotations. A bit of Ricky Nelson with a moustache. Or Ian Curtis naked in Cairo, half past three in the morning. Lyrically they combine topics like sex and crisis, attack and escape or dilemmas, love and lies. OUM SHATT is a boy group from Berlin below the poverty line, consisting of singer and innovator Jonas Poppe (Ex-Kissogram) who has been playing arabic and turkish records in Berlin clubs for years, the guitarist and actor Hannes Lehmann (Ex-Contriva, Mina) and drummer Chris Imler, the Don Corleone of Berlin rock'n'roll.
