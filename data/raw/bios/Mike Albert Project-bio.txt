Mike Albert began playing the guitar at the age of 9. Through out high school his ability on the instrument was well known and most parties he played at were packed or broken up because of the masses of people. By the age of 18 Mike began teaching the guitar professionally at Johnny Thompson’s Music Store in Monterey Park California. Being their youngest teacher ever. While teaching he developed a large clientele of students. After a year and a half Mike received a better offer from Berry & Grassmueks in Pasadena CA. that was frequented by guitar great Eddie Van Halen who soon became a friend of Mikes, being 1975 it was years before the first Van Halen album. At the time they developed a mutual admiration of each others playing ability but unfortunately never got involved with each other’s projects. At that time nobody was using the tremolo bar at all, since Hendrix and Blackmore from years before and recommended it to Edward who was using a Flying V through a 50-watt Marshall. Eddie thanked Mike for the advice and was soon using his tremolo armed Charvel, the rest is history  In 1978 the word was out that Frank Zappas “Reuben and the Jets” band was looking for a lead guitarist. Mike got the audition and soon was performing and recording with the group. Although the album never did anything, the professional atmosphere was a great learning experience. During that time Mike did quite a few movie sound tracks including Cheech and Chongs’ “Nice Dreams” and performed live with Cheech and Chong as their lead guitarist. Cheech on vocal and Tommy Chong on rhythm guitar. Mike kept busy playing in various blues and rock clubs in the Southern California beach area. 
          Dave Mustaine the leader of “Megadeth” had heard about Mike through Megadeth’s manager Jay Jones, because he was looking for another lead guitarist (Chris Poland had just left due to personal reasons). Dave’s reaction to Mike’s playing was (It was like) “blowing the top of my head off”. Mike was given the lead guitarist spot in Megadeth. Within 2 months of intense rehearsals Mike and his new band “Megadeth” were off on the bands first U.S. tour “KILLINGS MY BUSINESS TOUR”. The tour took them through over 40 cities. Co-headlining with them was “ANTHRAX”, “EXODOUS”, and “SLAYER”. After the 2nd branch of the tour, friction between Mike and Mustaine escalated to the point of Mike leaving the band. The Megadeth affiliation lasted under a year. Needing a break from all the touring and endless rehearsals Mike began an intense “wood shedding” and writing period. At the time Mike wrote over 100 original songs, in somewhat the same vain of his Megadeth experience. He also returned to doing recording sessions and sound tracks, the most recent sound track was in “Tia Carreras” “Hostile Intensions”, a “Budwieser Light” commercial, and a “Paul Rodriguez” TV special. Mike even has performed at the Los Angeles “Greek Theatre” and at the “Los Angeles Coliseum” with his own band.  The Original songs Mike has written took years to develop and finding the right musicians to interpret them, just as long. Finally, through a friend of Mike’s, (Steve Medrano), Mike has found the right combination. Enter, Jon Escobedo on Bass, Vocalist Richard Schroeder, and newcomers Angel Lujan on Drums and Ruben Martinez on 2nd guitar. Together they are the Mike Albert Project.             <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Albert+Project">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
