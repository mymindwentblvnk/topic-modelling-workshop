Michael Calfan, the new priority of the label Yellow Productions.

After a release break over the European Summer Axtone returns with a rather special track in the form of 'Resurrection' by Michael Calfan – number 1 on Beatport.

Originally debuted by Axwell on Radio 1 as part of the Swedish House Mafia take-over on Pete Tong's legendary Friday Night show, 'Resurrection' has become a stand out track in both his & his fellow mafioso's sets with the online community clamouring for news of its release.

Pete Tong has continued to support on his show, with DJ support also coming from Tiesto, David Guetta, Swedish House Mafia, Pete Tong, Avicii & more !

A new name to most, this young Frenchman is the protege of his compatriot and dance music royalty Bob Sinclar: "It was long since I had felt such good vibes with a young artist", Michael Calfan has had several releases on Bob Sinclar’s Yellow Productions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Calfan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
