Kråkesølv comes from Bodø, and they are not hiding it. Rock music, Norwegian lyrics, and great songs and choruses. These are keywords you have heard being used about the band previously, but now they are releasing their fifth album and it is time to do something different.  

The title track «Pangea» - the first single from their upcoming album - shows a band who can still write anthems in Norwegian, and that easily can play at both big festival stages and at small village parties. 

Kråkesølv’s music is still anchored in two guitars, bass, drums and lyrics written in their own dialect. But this time they have forced themselves to paint with a broader brush. «Pangea» shows a band challenging staid frameworks, and they are moving into landscapes that bands like Dungen and Radiohead have plowed before. But, as always, Kråkesølv land safely on their own Northern Norwegian feet. 

The reason why Kråkesølv now are taking a different direction than before, is mainly due to their producer, Lars Horntveth (Jaga Jazzist, Susanne Sundfør). In addition to producing, he has contributed in many ways, with giving good advice, with being a motivator and with playing instruments like piano, mellotron and vibraphone. Throughout the entire recording process, Horntveth has also been offering them fresh coffee and fiery cheers. 

Their lyrics have the same melancholy character that has coloured Kråkesølv’s universe since their debut album, and they continue to make connections between interpersonal and universal matters.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Kr%C3%A5kes%C3%B8lv">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
