Era Vulgaris began life in Dublin in 2005, formed from the remnants of several older rock and metal groups.  Settling on what would be their longest line-up (Chris Rob, Dave Buttner, Chris Con, Jim Kent) they recorded and released their debut album "What Stirs Within" in February 2007 (UK/Europe) and October 2007 (US). The album received huge critical acclaim all around the world (Metal Observer 10/10, Metal Invader 5/5, MetalTeamUK 9/10, Rock & Metal Domain 5/5 etc etc) and had tracks featured on international radio and magazines including Terrorizer UK.

In 2008 Chris Rob announced the band would be relocating to London but that this would involve the parting of ways with Jim Kent and Chris Con.  A new drummer, Anthony Pellier, and guitarist, Jamie Stungo, would be confirmed soon after their arrival in the UK.  Details are unclear as to what happened in London but within a year Chris Rob announced that he was putting aside music for the time being to return to his studies.  A 2-track EP (From Behind Enemy Lines) was recorded in January 2009 but so far only one track (More Is Said Than Done) has been released.

Chris Rob has said that a full second album will be written and recorded in the future.  "This is not the end." (quote from press release)  No news has yet been given as to a release date of From Behind Enemy Lines.
