A one-man finnish black metal band from Kuortane, Finland that has been active since 2004. 

There are over ten releases thus far, including splits with bands like Funerary Bell and Cosmic Church. In recent years there have come other musicians, but the main vessel of Blood Red Fog has been a mysterious individual known only as B.R.F who composed two of the four full-lengths entirely. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blood+Red+Fog">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
