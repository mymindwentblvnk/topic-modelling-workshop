Denominate is a progressive death metal band based in Oulu, Finland. Denominate draws influence from bands like Death and Carcass and blends it together with newer, more progressive and technical elements to create a progressive sound with a touch of old-school.

Denominate was originally formed under the name Encrypted when the band members were still in high school. It wasn’t until the release of their debut EP, “Realms of Confusion”, in late 2014 that the band really took off. The EP received favourable reviews with scores, such as 4-/5 from Metalliluola webzine and 9,5/10 from Kaaoszine. With the success of the EP, Denominate appeared in 2015 years Jalometalli Music Festival. Denominate had to change its name from Encrypted in 2015 due to threats of lawsuit by another band named Encrypted, which had trademarked the name.
