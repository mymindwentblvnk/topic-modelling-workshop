Central California super group formed from top notch local rock bands such as DeadSetAgainst, A.O.D., Vermin trash, SXY TM XPLSN, and Cruel Romeos.
Started in early 2009, but around in one form or another since 2007, meth leppard is a mesh of all that is rad about the music you love. From early metallica to nwobhm to doom, this band covers all the basis and all in one song.  A super showcase of screaming dueling leads and power rock jems. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Meth+Leppard">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
