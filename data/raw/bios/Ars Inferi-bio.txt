Ars Inferi is a black metal band from San Luis Potosi, Mexico. It was created in 2004 having as maximum influence the infinite black spirit. The result was the greatest dark cult expressed in chords of chaos, and music from the deepest universal vibration that will consume all those who are not prepared to hear its cataclysm. The guitars are made by Netsach, voice by Rebellion and a second guitar player is invited in live shows.

Ars Inferi has shared the stage with national bands like: Avzhia, Sargatanas, Black Vomit, Ereshkigal, Black Torment, Infinitum Obscure, Benatnash, Hymen of darkness, Black Palace, Satan, Osculum, etc… And with foreign outstanding bands like: Nodens (USA) Watain (SWE), Mystic Circle (GE), Dark Funeral (SWE), nocturnal depression ((FR), inter alia.

The first demo was made in an independent form, it was called: “Signa Animorum Inferi”, and the second one was named as “I am one with night”, it was conceived in an epistemological way and taken by Daemonokratia Prods, from Greece. In 2007 they made a full – length limited edition for the real underground movement.

In 2011 the third album was ended and called “Sacrophagia”. The band is still in talks with some national and international record companies about the distribution. There is a fourth album that is being worked on at recording studio.

The work is still supporting the character and transcendence of the objective of darkness as severely as ever. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ars+Inferi">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
