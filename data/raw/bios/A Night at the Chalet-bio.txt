After having solidified a line-up, A Night at the Chalet has made quite a name for themselves. Not only has the guitarist John LaVar stopped listeners in their tracks with his catchy riffs and solid breakdowns, but drummer Ian Olsen has astounded listeners with his incredible percussive talents. With both gruesome and meaningful lyrics from vocalist Corey Praefke, his words have always spoken out ...to listeners. They have pressed on and on since 2008 to get their self acclaimed name out into the nation and further. A Night at the Chalet's "Let's Do This Shit" has been pinned in the community's minds ever since they began. With they're dark tones and in-humanly fast shredding, they are just begging for exposure. A Night at the Chalet's stage presence has shocked nearly every crowd they have performed in front of with their synchronization and crowd involvement. A Night at the Chalet has only just begun, so with that said, "Let's Do This Shit!"
