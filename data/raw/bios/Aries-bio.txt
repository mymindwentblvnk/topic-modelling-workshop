Aries, hailing from Southern California, currently holds over 52 million total views and more than 430,000+ subscribers on his growing YouTube channel. He has been making videos since 2012; most of them are beat tutorials or challenges, of which the resulting beats are posted to his secondary SoundCloud page, WUNDERWORLD. He has just recently started releasing full-length songs under his WUNDERWORLD label (formally Chapter 9) the majority of which are all sung, written, and produced by him.

Aries is also Spanish musician Isabel Fernández Reviriego. By the time she launched her solo project, Fernández Reviriego had already staked out a solid career for herself. Then we discovered that inside her head there was a melodic, kaleidoscopic, punk and unpredictable universe. A world in which Brian Wilson –in the melodies– and Leon Tolstoi –in the law-breaking final message– could happily walk hand in hand dancing to electronic rhythms. She called this personal project Aries (her zodiac sign) and under this identity she has already produced four albums. Aries creates an orchestra that generates an exciting mixture of free-jazz, soul and folk rhythms, melodies from the girl groups of the 60s, sunshine pop and experimental electronics.
