Jungstötter is the moniker of singer Fabian Altstötter. As an adolescent in the tranquility of small-town Germany, he founded his first band Sizarr with two of his boyhood friends. They soon released two critically acclaimed albums which paved the way out of their hometown Landau to play shows throughout Europe and as far as SXSW in 2013. Their sound was youthful but already displayed a prevalent knowledge of pop history and a certain dysphoric aesthetic, which masked their youth.
Some years have passed and Altstötter is now based in Berlin. The coats have grown longer and the skin is tinged with morbid fantasies: the gloom lingers on with Jungstötter. Like the corollary to the multilayered sound of his old projects he has carved out a distinct style. The young singer has evolved into a storyteller. The songs unveil Jungstötter's qualities as a songwriter. They subsist on a dramaturgy in which one gets lost. A revelling stream that enters sometimes rough, sometimes timid and soothing waters. Lyrics and music coalesce and yield a poignant aesthetic.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jungst%C3%B6tter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
