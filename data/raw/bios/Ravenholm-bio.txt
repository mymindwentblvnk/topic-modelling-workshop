The band was founded in 2006, by Benni (guitar), Achim (guitar), Mike (drums) and Uli (bass). 
After some vocalist-changes, 2007, Til joined the band.

On 23.01.2009 they released their first EP titled „Zeitgeist“.

Between 2009 and 2010 it was getting quiet around the band, because Benni and Uli left them. 
But in 2010 they found new members with Phil and Olaf, and are working on new material now.

A new CD will be released in 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ravenholm">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
