There are few artists named as "katarsis".

1 . KATARSIS is a metal band formed in 2002. And since then they have been interested in making lyrics with social content combined with the distortions and melodies characteristic of classic heavy metal.
2. Katarsis is a new artist from Lithuania, creating nostalgic indie-pop, post-punk/post-rock music. Just recently discovered by hundreds when his first song and video clip of "VasarÄ… Galvoj Minoras" was uploaded in May, 2020.

Sometimes such name can be mixed up with another popular band from Germany, Katharsis, who create dark metal music since 1994.
