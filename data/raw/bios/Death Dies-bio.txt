Death Dies were created by an idea of Demian de Saba, who in that period was Sweet End's Angel's drummer (a 70es prog-jazz band) and then became Evol's one, Samael Von Martin, one of the founder of the cult black metal band Evol and RexT bass player in Evol.The main idea of the band is in the will of joining the most hateful black metal with many different prog influences (inspiring to Goblin's style) and folk influences, in order to create a sort of opera in an only act.
