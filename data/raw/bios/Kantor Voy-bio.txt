Progressive metal band Kantor Voy was formed in november 2003 from its 10 year old predecessor Carnifex.

The reason for this kind of metamorphosis was to mark the change in bands music that had already gradually evolved into something completely different than in the early years.

Kantor Voys musical influences range from seventies and eighties progressive rock to various styles of contemporary metal and electronic music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kantor+Voy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
