NWD is a four-piece band that melts metal with modern dance music. The story of Next Waste Dimension starts in the year 2000 when Jorik Tijssen [drums], Rikkert Achtereekte [guitars/vocals/programming] and Niels Achtereekte [bass/synths/programming] decide to start a groovy death metal band. They already know each other from their previous bands/projects and decide to join forces. NWDâ€™s heavy guitar sound is a contra weight that balances the layers of melodies and sounds, which are supported by the powerful rhythm section. Aggressive vocals convincingly express the [self]-critical lyrics.
The fourth member is Jeroen Traanman, who does the video-art and VJ-ing. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Next+Waste+Dimension">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
