Quiet Child are a four piece alternative rock band from Adelaide, South Australia, consisting of Paul on drums, Jason on guitar, Pete on vocals and guitar and Brent on bass. Their music ranges from two minute blasts of furious riff filled rock, to long, grandiose epics propelled by major dynamic shifts and melodic and rhythmic complexities. Quiet Child released their self titled debut e.p. in early 2007. 

Having spent the last few years sharing the stage with some of Australia's finest acts, 2011 saw the band come into their own as they hit the road to unleash their second album 'Thumper' as a follow up to 2009's 'Evening Bell'.

"Quiet Child is a force to be reckoned with and if thereâ€™s a local band worthy of your support, this is the one." Rob Lyon - Journalist for 'Rip It Up Magazine' - February 2007 

"The atmosphere created by the intricate sounds of Quiet Child made me never want to leave the wonderful place in my head they led me to." Talia Lomman - Journalist for 'dB Magazine' - March 2007 

"...Quiet Child are one of those rare chosen few where you can totally suspend your disbelief and simply drift along to it, no matter what's happening around you. Even if they were playing in a blackout whilst the room was slowly filling with water; we'd still be blissed out like serene stoners to an episode of Spongebob Squarepants..."
