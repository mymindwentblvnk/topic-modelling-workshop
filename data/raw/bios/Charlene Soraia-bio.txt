Charlene picked up her first guitar at the age of five. She played her first Open Mic night at the age of eight, and was a regular on the Open Mic circuit by the age of ten.

Completely self-taught, she won admission to the legendary BRIT School of Performing Arts despite failing to have the minimum requirement of a GCSE in Music. Once at the BRIT School she stopped performing acoustically and started playing in a band called Retrospect. She restarted her solo performances in 2008.

Charlene released her new EP entitled Daffodils & Other Idylls in March and has topped the uk Folk Charts on iTunes and will continue to play various shows around London in support of the record. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Charlene+Soraia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
