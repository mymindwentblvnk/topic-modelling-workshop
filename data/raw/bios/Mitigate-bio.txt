Symphonic/melodic death metal from Austria.

Mitigate was founded in January 2006 by Rene, Markus and Stefan. The music stile could be named "Symphonic Metal". This means it has symphonic (Orchestral, Pipes, classic parts, etc...), also modern elements in the songs bounded. Mitigate tried to create songs with refrains to attract largest auditory. Mitigate hope to be different in the music style. The point is to make good music for many people. The band enjoy all the new fans of this different new style they make.
Melancholic, yet melodic music. Slow to mid-fast tempo, suicidal atmosphere. Growls and clear male voices, which lead a long melody. Keyboards are well included and take instant share. Let's say it's a little bit of Amorphis with Elegy. Deadly guitar riffs combined with compact bass like Lake of tears in Headstones for example. All in all it worths listening!
