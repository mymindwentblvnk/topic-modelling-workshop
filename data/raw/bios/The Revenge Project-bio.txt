The Revenge Project began as a side project of members of more prominent metal musicians in Bourgas, Bulgaria, but this has changed, as most are not in any other bands anymore and are concentrating entirely on The Revenge Project's future. They have developed a very unique sound and great variety, although their is much consistency in their style - their songs sound different, but it's unmistakably the same band.

The band began with Staffa(guitars, ex-Kartzer), Nedelcho Harizanov(bass), G. McManus(vocals, Korozy), Deimoz(guitars, ex-Diabolism), Kalhas(drums, ex-Korozy). The line-up changed rather quickly in the beginning, with MaxPain(ex-Exhumation) replacing G. McManus on vocals and Astaroth(ex-Korozy) taking over bass duties. Later, Astaroth was replaced by Sevar on bass, however he also had to leave the band and was replaced by Articorse. A must for anyone into the darker, heavier and experimental side of metal.

Current lineup:
Staffa - Guitars
Deimoz - Guitars
Articorse - Bass
MaxPain - Vocals
Kalhas - Drums <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Revenge+Project">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
