UNDER FETID CORPSES started as a solo project by M.T. in 2001 with the release of the promo CD-R "Archives Of Urban Necroslaughtery", containing only three songs: "Excretion Of The Lacerated Fetus", "The Vomit Addict..." and "Fornicating The Wounds Of Her Headless Corpse". In November 1st 2002 this promo is released under the label of WAR PRODUCTIONS with professional layout (tape format; 250 hand numbered copies) and containing two bonus tracks: "Flesh Sculptor" and "Ran Over By A Roller". At the same time the demo tape was released, new members entered the band, joining the slaughter... Sandro[drums], Ricardo[guitar], M.T.[vocals/guitar], and Valter[bass] (de)compose the actual line up of UNDER FETID CORPSES. During the recordings of the first recording of UNDER FETID CORPSES as a band, Valter was invited to leave the band, due to lack of dedication. But this demo-CD-R was never finished because we were contantly unsatisfied with the way it sounded, and the band was starting to get appart... ...2004 In the beginning of the DAMN HOT summer of 2004 Ricardo decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. Seeing the band falling appart, M.T. didn"t want the massacre to end, so he decided to go back to the beginning and invited Sandro to leave the band... This way, it would be a lot easier to record something but impossible to play live, yet it seemed to be the best choice, since U.F.C. weren"t rearsaling for a long while... So, during August and September 2004 M.T. recorder the second demo-CD-R, a GRIND/THRASH keeping the spirit of the first recording but seting UNDER FETID CORPSES to a new level. This record is honest and direct. The sound quality is great, and you will (probably) only recognize that"s U.F.C. because the vocals are as brutal as allways. The rest... is even heavier! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Under+Fetid+Corpses">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
