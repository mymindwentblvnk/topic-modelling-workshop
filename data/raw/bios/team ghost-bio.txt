Fromageau split with M83 in 2003, and emerged from his hiatus when he performed at 2009's Midi Festival on the French Riviera, under the new moniker "Team Ghost". Their debut EP "You Never Did Anything Wrong to Me" was released on April 26th 2010 by Kiss Me First Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Team+Ghost">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
