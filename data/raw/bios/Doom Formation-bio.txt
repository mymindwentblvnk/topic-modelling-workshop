Starting out in Columbus, Ohio Doom Formation began in the mid 80's as a death metal band under the name Rotting Souls.  The band consisted of Tommy Justice (vocals bass), Mike Gill (Rythm Guitar), Frank Anelich (lead guitar), and Bradley Arnold (drums).  Playing the local scene and producing a couple of demos after a lineup change Mike and Brad continued to play and they became Doom Formation.  After playing on the local scene they managed to open for acts such as Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation, and a few metal fests with the lineup of Rob Gaines (vocals), Pete Berube (bass), Bradley Arnold (drums), Mike Gill ( Rythm Guitar), and Frank Anelich (lead guitar).  Then falling out in 1998.  They finally regrouped in 2006 with only Mike, Brad, and Frank as Rotting Souls again and are currently working on current Death Metal material.
