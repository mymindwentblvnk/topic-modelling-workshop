Lugburz Sleed - a band that does not adhere to any ideology or any religious or political trends. We believe that it is of no importance for humanity, as we are against •human reality• and •human nature• (who doesn't agree - FOAD!). This is expressed in our musical creativity. We do not consider ourselves to the musical genre of •black metal•, sometimes we go far beyond this genre. We call it •Chernihiv School•: Doomed Atmospheric / Depressive / Raw Post-Black Metal / Space Ambient and other Experimental Electronic. Lyrical themes: Transcendence Solipsism. Space & Cosmos. Depression & Joy.
