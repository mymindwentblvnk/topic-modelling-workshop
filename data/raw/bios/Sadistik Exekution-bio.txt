Sadistik Exekution is legendary in Australian metal circles, and one of the better known bands to come from down under. The band formed in 1986 and apparently gained a large following before even playing live or recording, due to the publicity stunts of co-founders Rok and Dave Slave. They have recorded sporadically over the last fifteen years or so, with their albums reportedly all in a similar style Musically, Sadistik Exekution plays a rather loose, messy, frenzied black/death metal, with some grind tendencies.
