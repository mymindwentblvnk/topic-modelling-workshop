Draugen was formed in december 2000 by Ghost & Okda Naos in order to play a style inspired by Norwegian bands, what strikes first at the listenning of the first compositions.

Through their musical background and influences, which are not necessary extreme metal, Draugen describes the melancholy and solitude felt in the modern society and the will to escape that world. It also express the will to retire in abandoned places and finally uses the death metaphore as a final spiritual retreat.

During a long time, looking for its own sound and touch, the band released two demos only given to friends and it has never done the slightest live show.
And this for two reasons:
Ghost has always been reluctant to perform live because of his fierce hatred of the crowd, moreover the band better works as a duo and both members don't feel the need to recruit someone else.
But in 2011, two session member are recruited in order to make live appearance

From 2001 to 2004 about fifteen tracks were composed:
2001-2003: First album (Among the Lonely Shades)
2003-2004: Previous second Album

The style changed from a slow and depressive one at the beginning to a more intense one with melodic parts.
After two years of a break, the duo wakes up and re-works the early tracks, before working on new material, thus to make definitely the old demons shut up.

Draugen never wanted to record its first album with a crappy sound and claim that sounds "TRUE BLACK METAL" and our will to improve constantly the sound and skill delayed the release of the album by far.

In september 2009 the band begins (at last) to record their first album " Among the Lonely Shades" containing recycled riffs from the 2001 period and which is 100% auto produced.
After almost ten years of existence the "Sea Ghost" is ready to unleashed its wrath.
