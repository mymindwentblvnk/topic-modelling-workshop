The band made several fantasy-based albums, first, in english. These are like "Legend of the Four Rings (1999)" and "Tales of a winter night (2000)". But in 2001, the band made their best and biggest project: to make the first Lord of the Rings metal opera.

The original name of the band was "Cross bones", but there was a printing error on their first poster, which named the band "Cross Borns". The members liked it, and renamed themselves.
