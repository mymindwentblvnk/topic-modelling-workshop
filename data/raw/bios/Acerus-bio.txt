A Molten MIxture of Heavy Metal created by  Mexico's Julio Viterbo (Tormentor,Shub Niggurath, The Chasm,Cenotaph,Obeisance) and Daniel Corchado (Cenotaph, The Chasm, Magnum Itiner Interius, Incantation, Obeisance)in December 2012 with the sole purpose of  playing and composing  some personal basic ideas and riffs that surge from the inspiration of days long gone, not intended to revive or live in the past or to break any grounds and not to be Death Metal related in any way. This is Heavy Metal the way they hear and feel it in present times, music for the pleasure of playing it. The band is rounded by Roberto Valle on Vocals (from Thy Only Forgotten,ex-The Chasm ) and Geoff Montgomery on drums (Hordes of the Lunar Eclipse, ex-FOG). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ACERUS">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
