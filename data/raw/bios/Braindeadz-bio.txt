BRAINDEADZ are devoted to the thrash metal of the glorious 80's. 

Braindeadz are playing Old School thrash metal with a massive dose of Rock'n'Roll. "Mot√∂rhead goes thrash metal." That's how their style could be described. Their sound is rooted to the soil with catchy, razor sharp riffs, poignant solos, simple but diversified song structures, shrieking vocals and wicked lyrics.
