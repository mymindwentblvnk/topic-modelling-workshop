Back in may 1989, Eternal Solstice was founded by Ramon Soeterbroek, Philip Nugteren, Edwin Roor and Kees-Jan Schouten. After Edwin Roor left the band, two ex-Sempiternal Deathreign members we "recruited" and the following line-up was a fact:
 * Kees-Jan Schouten - Vocals
 * Philip Nugteren - Guitars
 * Victor van Drie - Guitars
 * Ramon Soeterbroek - Bass
 * Mischa Hak - Drums

After a period of practising Mischa Hak came up with the idea to realize a self-financed split album of the two bands he was playing with (besides Eternal Solstice he also played with a band called Mourning). So the Reel Sound Studio was booked on 20 - 21 june 1990 for Eternal Solstice. But just before the recording sessions would take place Kees-Jan Schouten decided to leave the band. The vocal parts on the four recorded songs were realized by bass-player Ramon Soeterbroek. Then the problems started.

Several record companies reacted, but none of them really had the guts to release this piece of death metal (recorded before some of today's well-known death metal acts were even founded). Another accidental problem was that during this time the Eternal Solstice line-up collapsed. Mourning decided to release 3 of their 5 recorded tracks as a demotape and the Reel Sound recordings of Eternal Solstice were doomed to be unreleased. Until... Mr Belgium himself, Wim Baelus, decided to release the split album on his own label called Midian Creations. So finally (2 years too late) the split-album was released in the summer of 1992.

In the meantime Philip Nugteren and Ramon Soeterbroek decided to dig up Eternal Solstice and start all over again. A drummer soon was found in the person of Eric Bontekoe and in the beginning of 1993 a new vocalist joined the band. But after recording a promotape in march 1993 it became clear that both Eric and the other person were not capable enough, at least not for Eternal Solstice. So both were asked to leave the band at the end of 1993. Ramon returned to the vocals and their friend and former band member Mischa Hak was asked to play drums on their self-financed full-lenght album "The wish is father to the thought". The album was recorded during april 1994 at the Excess studio in Rotterdam and released at the end of the summer of 1994. Soon after the release they found a permanent drummer in the person of Andre van der Ree who used to play with Mourning.

In the beginning of 1995 Poseidon Productions decided to re-release the full-lenght album and distribute it worldwide. The new version of the CD was released in may 1995 and sold quite good on an international level. The band recorded their second album "Horrible Within" which was released by Poseidon Productions in november 1995. It received great reviews from various European mags (RockHard 8 spot in Soundcheck: 8/10 points, Aardschok 89/100).

Eternal Solstice thought it was time to show the world that true death metal never dies and recorded a new album, containing 5 brandnew songs plus the tracks from the split-album with Mourning. "Demonic Fertilizer" was released on Poseidon Productions in august 1997. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eternal+Solstice">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
