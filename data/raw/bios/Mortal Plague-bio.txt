Mortal Plague was formed as a solo project in 2009 by Jonathan Wade after his previous band, Gorgon, disbanded. A few demo tracks were written and Eric Innes was recruited on guitars. Together they released a debut album titled "The Ballad of Misanthropy". By the time it was released Eric left for school, and Jonathan began writing with his old bandmate Kevin Woo. They wrote the "Winter is Neverending" demo, which was released at Northwestern Black Circle Fest 2 in 2010. They then released "Omens" in 2011 with great reception. A third album was then started, with music written entirely by Jonathan and some lyrics written by Kevin. Near the end of the writing process, a full line-up was formed and Mortal Plague played their first show, and started writing their first album as a full band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mortal+Plague">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
