Seba has been making beats for time, originally on Good Looking, Seba now releases regularly on Paradox Music and his Own Secret Operations as well as one offs for the likes of Headz and Hospital. Seba dropped into Refuge last August and tore the roof off. We are delighted to have him on board both on Rare Grooves and alongside Paradox(pictured) with Frost and Sound On Sound.

Krazy is one of the pioneers of the swedish dnb movement.
