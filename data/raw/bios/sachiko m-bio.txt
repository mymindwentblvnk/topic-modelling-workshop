Sachiko M has been active as a sampler player since 1994. Early in her career she was involved in the cut-up and "plunderphonic" sampling movements. 

In '98, in a drastic departure from those approaches, she originated the revolutionary method she uses to this day--manipulating the sampler's internal test tones. With the 2000 release of Sine Wave Solo, her extreme solo recording consisting entirely of sine waves, Sachiko M suddenly became the focus of intense interest on the international scene, including European music festivals and Britain's Wire magazine. 

Since then she's been active on an irregular basis in a number of projects - including the experimental electronic music duo Filament, the electronics trio I.S.O., a duo with Toshimaru Nakamura, and the duo Cosmos with Ami Yoshida, and one of her longest collaborators Otomo Yoshihide - in addition to collaborating with various musicians from other countries. Two of the solo projects she's currently working on are live performance series and the sound installation I'm Here.

Sachiko M's radical stance consistently draws interest and provokes debate.
