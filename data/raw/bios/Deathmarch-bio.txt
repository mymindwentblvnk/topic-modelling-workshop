Deathmarch is a Canadian heavy metal band, hailing from Hamilton Ontario. DEATHMARCH released one album via Northern Storm Records in October 2007. Self-titled and clocking in at 50 minutes, the CD showcases an electric mix of blackened melo-death metal. Since its inception, DEATHMARCH has shared the stage with DARK FUNERAL, 3, ENSIFERUM, NAGLFAR, KATAKLYSM, DISMEMBER, QUO VADIS, AUGURY, CRYPTOPSY, DYING FETUS, CANNAE, DAATH and PROFUGUS MORTIS, as well completed a Canadian tour with MACABRE in December 2007. They have also recently completed a series of live dates with Swedens OPETH. No one knows for sure what is in store for the future of Deathmarch, but they are well on their way to achieving success on the Canadian, and worldwide metal scene, and nothing will stand in their way. 


There is a Polish band called Deathmarch as well.
