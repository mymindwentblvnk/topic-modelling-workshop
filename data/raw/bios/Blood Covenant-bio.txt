The group was formed in 2001. It was formed by Sergey and Garik. At that time the name of the group was Iron Cross and played in thrash/death metal style. Vocalist Dave joined the group in that year and they let out the first demo album Iron Cross in September of the same year. In 2002 the vocalist of the group became Sergey, as Dave had left the group. The style of the group changed and they began to play in Sympho/black metal style. The name of the group was also changed. Now it is called Blood Covenant.

In 2003 they let out the second album The Day of the Lord.

In 2007 they let out the third album The Blood of the New Covenant, where participated singer Arthur Areskin, (ex-vocalist of AYAS), father of Sergey. The group has given concerts and took part in many Rock & Metal festivals.

The aim of the group is to show what Jesus did for people, the relationship between God and people. 

The plan of the group is to write music inspired by God, to show people the love of Jesus and the hatred of Satan towards them.
