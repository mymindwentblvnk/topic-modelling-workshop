Formed in April 2008 in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Command6 was born with the intention of creating a heavy, nervous and brutal sound, mixing striking melodies and powerful riffs without the concern of being labeled. The band was formed from an idea between friends, where all had already had some time on the road with other bands and projects.
