From the darkest corners of England, far away from the stale odours of the modern masses and the tired trend-led scenes that for years now have become saturated with generic sounds and premeditated actions. The creatures of the night joined forces in the depths of the Hate Basement to conceive a new breed of dark metal and by doing so they spawned a behemoth that will give heavy music fans something they can truly scream about, and its name… Numpty Wizard!

Forged in the summer of 2009, Numpty Wizard immediately created a sound that is both genre-defying and brutally British. Incorporating a focus on horror storytelling and welding it with a genuine aim to provide a much needed shot of originality to the arm of the metal scene. The band are fast building a reputation and following from their debut EP and memorably intense live shows.

The self-published debut EP Demo(n)s is now available to purchase and download from the band themselves; it is not so much a debut but a horrific statement of intent. With 5 tracks of unashamed metal that unite different styles, influences and concepts into a fiendish, and altogether bigger, beast it includes tales of lycanthropy (Wolfen), zombie holocausts (All Guns Blazing), dealings with the devil (And Then, There Was Hell), revenge from beyond the grave (Coffin Full of Snakes) and a brutal and epically haunting spin on the classic Robert Louis Stevenson tale ‘The strange case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (Jekyll and Hyde).

To go along with its release, Numpty Wizard are looking to bring their brand of metal to stages all over the UK.
