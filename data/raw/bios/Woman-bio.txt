1) A band from Brookyn
"Woman, led by the twin vocal/guitar towers of Australian native Kristian Brenchley and Mexico City’s Brett W Schultz, and featuring the skinniest and coolest looking rhythm section in town, the black-clad Skeleton Boy and Alex Velasquez, remain one of the rawest, most brutal, and least compromised ensembles in the tri-state area. But don’t be frightened, its only rock’n’roll…" 
-- NEW YORK NIGHT TRAIN 

"Woman, the band split international-playboy-style between NYC, USA and Mexico City, DF, and led by an able Australian—Beefheart splatter guitar over caveman rhythm section and split ursine vocals; sounded like Link Wray catching up to Black Flag, or something from Nick Cave, too... Coming LP should be good—too-sick rock from two sick cities." 
-- Chris Ziegler, The District Weekly 

"WOMAN is a Death-Squad - WOMAN is the dope-antidote-Gonorrhoea for antechrist humors - Full of elation EvZone Heat- Full of Erogenous Decadence From Ancient Proto-Romantism Bad Apple Souvenir to The New Fall-Krachic-Growing Pale World - Seeking Drive for our Poor Urban Pubic Bone Lost Contemporary Souls" 
-- Blackbird M. L. Bone 


"WOMAN sucked. I think the whole band was on heroin." 
-- some asshole from Cleveland

They'll be back.

3) Germany (Cologne)
Indie pop band WOMAN from Cologne, Germany. Founded in 2012, the trio took their time to perfect their signature sound that spans synth-pop, JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE-infused singing and guitar licks that give a nod or two to SANTANA. At some point, a CD of their demos made its way to BILDERBUCH producer Zebo Adam, who went on to produce their debut EP Fever, a triumphant celebration of funk-pop with shades of electronic elements. Fortunately for us, the collaboration proved to be fruitful, as he also produced WOMAN‘s first album Happy Freedom, which aims to carry that spirit onto a full-length record. Marvelous City is the first glimpse of that debut LP.
