Vatican Plague began life in 2003 with Nathan and JP after their previous band The Demonic split up the year before. Nathan, on drums, and JP doing guitars, vocals and programming. The first demo 'Pontification' was received reasonably well in 2004 and an immediate follow up also in 2004, consisting of older material written by JP, 'Heil to the Vanquished and The Dream Onyx' has some killer tracks. Although seeming like a parody on JP's former bands, Veil of Anguish and The Demonic, JP sincerely meant to tribute to the days of yore. In early 2005 the duo entered the studio to record their first EP, 'Seeds Sown to Ransack Rome', with re-recording of 'Vestibulum' (Pontification) and 'A Samain Ether' (Heil to the Vanquished and The Dream Onyx) featuring. Four brand new tracks with big production will impress. Later in 2005 Nathan decided to discontinue his musical interests and focused instead on his career. Finally, in 2011, JP has re-mixed and mastered 'Seeds Sown to Ransack Rome' and is ready to unleash here.    Enjoy and bring out your dead!
