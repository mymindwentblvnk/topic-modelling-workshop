Wilds Forlorn is an utterence of loss, grief, frustration, anger, and world-weariness. Founded in 2008, originally, the music consisted of only piano works, but the project eventually took a different turn. Wilds Forlorn can be seen as a solemn lamentation for the burden of existence in the modern world.
