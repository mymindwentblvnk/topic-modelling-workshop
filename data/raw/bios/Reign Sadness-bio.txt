Reign Sadness was founded in the Autumn of 2007 by guitarists Jere Pellikka and Sami Räsänen. They quickly developed their own style of guitar work, mixing the rock'n'roll and metal experiences of Jere with the harsh deathrash and blazing leads of Sami. With something new in their hands, a band was formed shortly after. Since 2007 the style has continued developing in to an interesting mix of modern melodic metal with some death influences.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Reign+Sadness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
