Crash Syndrom was an old school death metal (1st album only), then brutal death metal / grindcore band from Tokyo, Japan.  The band started in 2004, then recorded 4 demos during 2005-2006.  Due to the lack of skillful musicians, the band stopped its existence.   Kyrylo Stefanskyi (guitar, vocals) is from the Ukraine.  Tomo (bass) and Takahiro Okada (drums) are from Tokyo, Japan.  There's no information about other members from 2004-2006.  In late 2007 there was an attempt to reunite the band (full line-up except the drummer!) but it stopped its existence forever in September 2008 due to bass player departure to the far-away-lands. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crash+Syndrom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
