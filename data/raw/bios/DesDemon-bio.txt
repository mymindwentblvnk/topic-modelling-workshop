Hailing from the dormant NYC metal scene is the female fronted metal band, DesDemon. The group is based upon a dark and twisted tale of a woman’s fall from grace, and her evolution to a darker side of life. Musically these tales are expressed through a darkly splendid array of metal elements, incorporating many of metals most popular sub-genres. In listening to DesDemon, you’ll hear elements of Power Metal, Symphonic Metal, Thrash Metal, Progressive Metal, Doom Metal, and Black Metal. The blend of these influences has created a beautifully devious sound that could be best described as Blackened Symphonic Metal.

DesDemon is a solid quintet comprised of :

Mistress Tina - Vocals 
Lord Metadox - Lead Guitars
Nicholas Gati - Keyboards
Ron “Pelagius” Porcelli - Bass
Dan Rhodus - Drums

Quotes on the band:

"They are a female fronted act and deliver the kind of epic soaring that one regularly enjoys when either Epica or Nightwish takes the stage. The band is fronted by Mistress Tina who clearly has some pipes and the hulking guitar presence of Lord Metadox”… Ken Pierce - PiercingMetal.com (USA) 

…”a well skilled band, female fronted and a sound ranging from Dark to Progressive metal with slices taken from the world of Power and even Black Metal”… Metal to Infinity (BE) 

…”the centerpiece of this metallic feast, is the voice of singer Mistress Tina”… Metal Rocker (CZ) 

...” "The Awakening" is a dark and powerful piece of music that not only draws you in within the first few seconds but captivates your mind and body.”… Lady Draconian (a.k.a Tayla Dickinson) - Chalice Of Femme Metal (www.chaliceoffemmemetal.com - UK)
