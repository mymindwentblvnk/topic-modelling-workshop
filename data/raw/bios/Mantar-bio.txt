February 2014 sees the two piece German monster Mantar release their debut album on Svart Records. Recorded earlier in 2013 and titled "Death By Burning", the album is a raw, self produced and 100% DIY display of power. Mantar manages to sound even and heavier than most five piece bands you may know, in spite of the fact that no bass guitar was used on this record. Just drums and guitar set for destruction. Forget about Rock `n Roll. This will hurt. Flogging beats and blackened melodies meet feedback orgies and doom mayhem. Early Melvins, Mot√∂rhead, Darkthrone. You name it. Don`t call it sludge though. Everything as black as possible. A soundtrack for the final battle.
