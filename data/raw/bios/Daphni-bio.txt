There are two artists known as Daphni:

1) Music project of Caribou's Dan Snaith. Daphni's debut album, Jiaolong, has been released on 8 October 2012 on Merge Records.

"During the time I was making the Caribou album Swim, I'd fallen back in love with moments in small, dark clubs when a DJ puts on a piece of music that not only can you not identify, but that until you heard it you could not have conceived of existing," Snaith said. "Daphni tracks are rough and spontaneous â€¦ They're about working fast and intuitively, capturing the manic energy needed to start a track one afternoon, have it finished, and be playing it in a club that night."

"I've been surprised by the number of transcendent moments that I, sober and in my mid-30s, have had in clubs in the last few years," Snaith said. "Set against the backdrop of bland and functional dance music there is a small world where dance music lives up to its potential to liberate, surprise and innovate. There's some magic in it still."


2) Female-fronted rock. An energitic, melodic, and expressive group out of Green Bay, Wisconsin, Daphni has a unique and distinctive original sound that will grow on you. With female fronted lead vocals and a solid backline of musicians, this album rocks!
