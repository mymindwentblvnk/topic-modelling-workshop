Danny Lee Blackwellâ€™s Night Beats project started in Texas, found its sound in Seattle, then traveled down to California. That peripatetic existence fits a band that sounds like a cowboy dropped a bunch of acid, wandered in the desert, and erupted from a cloud of dust and weed smoke to front a rock band. Think 13th Floor Elevators and fulsome guitar riffs and Sergio Leone soundtracks and, sure, a dash of R&B. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Night+Beats">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
