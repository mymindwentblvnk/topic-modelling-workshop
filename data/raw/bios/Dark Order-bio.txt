Australia is known for many famous bands over the years, like that of AC/DC, INXS, but it still remains "The Undiscovered Country" of true and real Heavy Metal. Isolation has meant that ONLY the best influences reach bands here, while the general glut of crap stays away. This unique condition has helped produce Australia's modern Thrash Metal band, DARK ORDER.

Since it's inception in 1993 (Under the name Vanadium) the band has stood the test of time for over 15 years to evolve a sound unique to itself, unlike any band that exists in Australia. They are veterans of the metal scene of Australia. Being predominantly Thrash Metal, they have blended touches of Death Metal, Traditional Heavy Metal, and Power Metal, plus adding powerful South American Andean music, Guitarist/Vocalist Raul Ignacio Alvarez Garcia has forged a sound, that in Australia, is [unique].

[This music] was first unleashed in a primordial state in 2 demo's 1994-'Warrior God-King' & 1995-'War of Attrition' (name change from Vanadium to Dark Order occurred here). The later demo was reviewed by the then Sony A & R rep Clayton Doherty, who referred to the style as "Jungle Metal"; (REBEL RAZOR, issue ..12). He was the one who highlighted the South American influence, which the band itself had created unintentionally, but which is understandable because of Raul's Chilean heritage.

By 1996-7, DARK ORDER recorded the 1st album, which was released locally in 1998. Titled 5000 Years Of Violence, [the album] demonstrated that the 'DARK ORDER sound' had evolved an indomitable foundation. World wide reviews averaged 3.75/5 for this album, which was only a taste of things to come.

During May 2001, recording for the second album commenced. This manifestation, released in November 2002, [was] the next testament to Dark Order's unique evolution. Titled...The Violence Continuum, the album was originaly released in Australia through Something for now/MGM distribution, and, in the U.S.A./CANADA region, through METAL-RULES.COM distribution exclusively. The album set a standard by which other Australian albums were judged. World wide reviews averaged 4.5/5.

In 2002-2003 the band gained 2 SUPPORTS slots with Germany's Destruction & Ireland's Abbadon Incarnate. In February of 2004, Dark Order joined up to Australias leading export label, BATTLEGOD PRODUCTIONS. This label distributes through Twighlight-Vertrieb, based in Germany, distribute Dark Order & the other Battlegod releases through out Germany and the rest of the world..

A special edition of THE VIOLENCE CONTINUUM was then produced - a duel-sided disc CD/DVD release containing a fully remixed version of the album and a full DVD titled Realm of the Violence Continuum. The DVD contained two video clips Slaves of A nameless God & The Terran Empire & special features. It was released on 20th OCTOBER 2006 worldwide though BATTLEGOD/TWILIGHT-VERTRIEB.
