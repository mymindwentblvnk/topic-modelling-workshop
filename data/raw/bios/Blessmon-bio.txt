Blessmon started in the year 2000 as one of the fucking hardest
Black Metal bands of Austria. Around 2001 they played their
first gigs and released the album "in morte sumus". A raw, pure and
fast Black Metal album, which included 8 songs. About one
year later in October 2002 they released a demo CD which is called
"sacrificium aeternitatis". A 4-Track demo of fucking
pure Black Metal. After this they took a break of two years.

In the year 2006 they started again to play fucking Black Metal.
They wrote songs for a new album which will be released in autumn
this year and it will be the greatest album Blessmon ever recorded.
They are back. And they will show us how Black Metal sounds.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blessmon">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
