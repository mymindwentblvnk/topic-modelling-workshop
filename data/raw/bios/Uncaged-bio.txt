Trapped in the jungle, this lion unchained himself and broke out of his cage to show the hardstyle scene the true power he possesses. With a great deal of diversity in all his tracks you can safely say that it isn't wise to put this beast inside a cage. By surprising and overwhelming the hardstyle scene with his powerful remix of Sub Sonik's hit 'M.F. Psycho,' he instantly stepped into the spotlight and showed everyone what he was capable of.

While his pride, consisting out of his most loyal fans, expanded across the globe, Uncaged kept improving his sound and created hit tracks such as 'The Wave' and 'The Heat'. With these releases Uncaged proved himself as a newcomer who's been on many hardstyle lovers' watch list. This animal already made an official Anthem for Outlands Festival and performed at Defqon.1, Decibel, REBiRTH, Intents Festival and Wish Outdoor.

Start the rage and break free from your cage. You can't hide, join Uncaged's pride! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Uncaged">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
