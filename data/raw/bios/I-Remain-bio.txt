i-Remain were formed in Stockport at the end of 2003 by vocalist Alex Creamer (former Dearly Beheaded singer). 

Originally formed as a jamming session between friends, things got more serious when i Remain started to grow a strong fan base from local Manchester gigs, mainly due to their original thrash sound and blistering live performance. Described as a cross between Slayer and Slipknot, I Remain are influenced by Black Sabbath, The Haunted, Lamb of God and Chimaira to name a few.At the beginning of 2004, i Remain entered the studio to record a 3-track demo which immediately grabbed the attention of a number of record labels also receiving excellent press, including 9/10 “demo of the month” in Metal Hammer magazine.  i Remain re-entered the studio again early 2005 to record their debut album ‘Brutality of Terror’ i Remain have shared the stage with FaceDown, Byzantine, Gutworm, RSJ, Jonny Truant, i-def-i, Profane, Interlock, KingSize Blues, Malefice, Zero Cipher.    

Creamer has recently joined www.myspace.com/theconstruct_band and have started to get a great underground buzz going.
