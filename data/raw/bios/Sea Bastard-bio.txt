Sea Bastard are a doom band from Brighton on the south coast of the UK.  Sea Bastard formed in July 2011 from the ashes of two then recently-deceased Brighton doom bands, Jovian and Funeral Hag and their sound is a fusion of the two bands' styles; the uncompromising lethargy of Jovian meeting the groove of Funeral Hag.

The band recorded their first demo in October 2011, Great Barrier Riff, which is available for free download from various sources including right here on Last.FM, Bandcamp and Archive.org.  The demo was recorded live at 284 studios in Brighton.  CD copies and shirts are available from the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sea+Bastard">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
