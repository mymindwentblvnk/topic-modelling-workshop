4. 'Spooky doo-wop' band from Leicester, UK. Adventures in high visibility as "the other", constant paranoia that gets increasingly justified, post-referendum panic, war-on-drugs PTSD, body positivity and negativity alike, identity erasure, sexual obsolescence and awakening, intimacy and lack of confidence, hate crimes and mental health. Just the general crap that each of us deal with in different ways and intersections. Coping through the power of noise, pedals, riffs, drums and infinite singalongs.
First album You’re Nothing To Me was released in 2018.
