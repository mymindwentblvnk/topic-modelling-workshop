The Architechs are a pioneering UK garage group consisting of Tre Lowe and City and, for a short period, also Kevin Williams (K-Warren).

They gained international attention in the summer of 1998 after remixing Brandy & Monica's "The Boy Is Mine" selling over 40,000 copies of the bootleg.

Up to this point speed garage had used mainly samples and the kind of raw sounds most commonly heard on hard house records. The R&B crowd, already intrigued by the vocal element of the scene, was more than ready to embrace the shift in direction kickstarted by Architechs - the first time anyone had laid down a full length R&B vocal over a 2-Step backing [1]. An onslaught of Garage/R&B bootlegs followed. They also produced remixes for several popular artists such as the All Saints, Gabrielle, Justin Timberlake and 'N Sync, Usher, Mariah Carey, Faithless, Garbage, Beenie Man, Jamelia and countless others. Several of their tracks have been featured on Pure Garage.

With the release of "Show Me The Money" the group were interviewed on Popworld. The Architechs were scheduled to release a full length album in early 2002, but it seems to have never surfaced.

The Architechs' Tr√© and City had been producing R&B separating for years until "The Boy is Mine" rework which featured a then unknown K-Warren. After the success of the release and other R&B-flavored garage they felt they could be more successful outside the struggling UK R&B scene and in the Garage scene. As K-Warren left to pursue a solo career, Lowe and City hooked up with one of City's previous collaborators "Nana", who features on both of the Architechs commercially successful singles, and released a solo R&B record in 2005.
