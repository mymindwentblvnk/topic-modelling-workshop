Days Of Perversion are a ridiculously talented trio based in London, England. They play a style of technical death metal that is punishingly brutal yet surprisingly melodic. The solos are more than a little reminiscent of the neo-classical style of Necrophagist's Muhammed Sui√ßmez but, considering these guys are barely in their twenties, there is ample time for them to develop.

An demo EP is currently in production, and preview tracks can be found at their myspace page.

Line-up:
Tom Blackwell - Vocalisations, Guitars
Adam Hooton - Guitars, Programming
Warren Doyle - Bass <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Days+Of+Perversion">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
