Bloodhorse is a Sludge/ Stoner Rock band based in Boston/ Brooklyn.

Current Members are: Alex Garcia-Rivera (drums), Matt Woods (bass & vocals), and Adam Wentworth (guitar & vocals).

They claim to be influenced by such legendary acts as Hawkwind and Hellhammer, and that influence is evident in their music, though they retain their own sound.  Translation Loss released their Selftitled EP in 2007, as well as their first full length, Horizoner, in May 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bloodhorse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
