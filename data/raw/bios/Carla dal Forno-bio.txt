Carla dal Forno is an Australian singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. After a short period in Berlin, she is currently based in London. She is a member of the groups F ingers and Tarcar, and formerly cult Melbourne outfit Mole House.

Her acclaimed debut album You Know What It's Like (2016) and follow up EP The Garden (2017) – both released on Blackest Ever Black – have established her as a singular new talent who navigates the inbetween zones of post-punk, industrial, narcotic dub and dream pop.

As a solo artist she crafts artfully atmospheric and emotionally ambiguous songs, displaying an observer's eye for detail and a painterly sense of proportion. Her productions channel a mittel-Europa aesthetic, featuring greyscale synth textures, pulsing drum machines, stripped back guitar lines and disorientating bass undertow, with her glacially detached voice soaring high above. Live she performs as a shadowy and transfixing duo with multi-instrumentalist Mark Smith. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carla+dal+Forno">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
