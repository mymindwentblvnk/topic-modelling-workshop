Ideas had been composed in 2003 by guitarist Nick Ochs to start a project which would in the future become Cephalotripsy. Within two and a half years, drummer Kyle Heart,(Dark Lay Still), joined. Producing unheard of inhuman drum abilities, we were off to compose material with newly joined bassist Rah(skelator). Due to the departure of Rah for relocating purposes as well as Kyle for similiar reasons, a search was conducted once again for the next year and a half. At the introduction of Forrest Stedt(Condemned) at a show, the need of a drummer was brought about and he agreed to tryout. Drummer Forrest Stedt and Vocalist Angel Ochoa(Condemned) pushed themselves and were ripping through material days on end. Upon the creation of 3 songs: Aesthetic Upholstery of Molested Dead Flesh, Embryonic Gastronomy and Sanguinary Misogynistic Execration, a three song demo was recorded. Cephalotripsy was formed in San Diego, CA. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cephalotripsy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
