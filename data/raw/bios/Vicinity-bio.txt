Vicinity was founded in 2006 by Kim-Marius H. Olsen, Frode Lillevold and Kristian Nergård. Vocalist Alexander K. Lykke soon joined the blend making the first complete lineup. The band wrote and later recorded a demo in 2007 at Skansen Lydstudio in Trondheim, but it was the following year's recording of the EP "Diffusion of Innovation" that the band found it's true style, writing longer, more technical, progressive compositions. The EP was recorded and mixed (by Børge Finstad) at Toproom Studios in one week, and released two years later (2010) by Pug-Nose Records.

In 2012 the band felt they had enough good material to enter the recording studio once more, this time to record their debut album. Drums were laid down in Trondheim Studio in february, followed in the following months by bass, guitars and vocals. In addition to being the band's debut album, "Awakening" is also the recording debut of bass player Pierre-Nicolai H. Schmidt-Melbye, who joined the band following Nergård's departure in 2009. In addition to the performances by the regular band members, the record features the keyboard talents of Reidulf Wormdal, who joined in the recording as a session musician to add a little extra spice to the mix.

The album was mixed by André Alvinzi and mastered by Jens Bogren, both at Fascination Street Studios. and will be released by Indie Distribution and Pug-Nose Records, fall 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vicinity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
