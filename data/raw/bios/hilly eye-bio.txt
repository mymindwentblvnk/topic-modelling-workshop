Hilly Eye is a Brooklyn, NY based noise rock duo formed in 2009 by guitarist/vocalist Amy Klein (formerly of Titus Andronicus) and drummer/vocalist Catherine Tung.  Amy and Catherine met at Harvard University as they were both radio DJs at the college's radio station.  They were also both students in the creative writing department.  They have stated Afrirampo, Sonic Youth, Pixies, Sleater Kinney, Lightning Bolt, and Marnie Stern as musical influences.  They write all of their songs together; some are somewhat improvised and can vary with live performances.

Hilly Eye released their debut EP, Fireworks, on October 8, 2010 via Bandcamp for free/donation.  Physical CD copies have been sold at shows as well.

In 2012, Hilly Eye signed to the indie New Jersey based Don Giovanni Records (Screaming Females, Black Wine, The Ergs!), through which they've released their debut full-length album Reasons to Live on January 22, 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hilly+Eye">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
