Formed in 1995, but existed since 1987 as a loose musical unit revolving around drummer Karsten Larsson and guitars/bassist Lars Tängmark from small town Mjölby in Sweden. Recorded self-titled MCD in 1996 and pressed 500 copies that were distributed worldwide. The disc contains soma astonishingly simplistic black/death metal as is now a rarity. A change towards a more melodic/atmospheric sound in 1997 didn't go well with the number of labels who were interested in signing the band at the time (on the merits of the mini-album), and as a consequence the 1997 demo "The Valley" wasn't widely distributed. Instead, the band concentrated on composing and recording privately over the next few years. The Choir of Vengeance was put on ice for a few years when Lars Tängmark moved temporarily to a different part of Sweden, but in the spring of 2004 the band was rehearsing again. Currently, the Choir of Vengeance are rehearsing and composing material for a recording session later this year. The music is intense, atmospheric and melodic death/black metal with a strong deathrock-infleuence in the lyrical/vocal department. The Choir of Vengeance has not played live since 1997, and there are no plans to do so either. All members of the Choir of Vengeance are (or have been) active in various other musical projects. Karsten and Magnus are members of Falconer. Magnus is a member of Catapult the Smoke. Lars Tängmark is a member of the Wounded Meadow and Lost in the Woods. Both Lars and Karsten were members of Dawn in the 90s. Karsten and Rickard were also members of Mithotyn.
