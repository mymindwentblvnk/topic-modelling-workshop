Formed in 1986, DEAD CONSPIRACY, is to this day considered by many as a pioneer and influence to death/gore metal bands worldwide. Until recently, there demo tapes could only be found in the collections of the most old school and avid underground music fans. In 2006, NUNSLAUGHTER's Don"of the dead" and Hells Headbangers records contacted members of DEAD CONSPIRACY with the idea of releasing the ba
nds catalog of demo's together on one CD. The result was the release of "Gore Drenched Legacy", a full length cd with an amazing booklet full of liner notes, photos, lyrics, concert flyers, etc. The members of DEAD CONSPIRACY have continued to stay active in music over the years and have currently put together a new lineup which was unleashed at 2012's Goregon Massacre Festival III. With the band getting such a wave of acceptance, a new album and tour will be in the works over the next while... re-gorging on the original style of VOMIT GORE that was brought to the table so long ago! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+Conspiracy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
