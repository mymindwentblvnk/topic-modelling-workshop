Ludus was a post-punk band formed in 1978 in Manchester, UK by guitarist Arthur Kadmon, drummer Philip Tolman, bassist Willie Trotter, and singer Linder Sterling (Linda Mulvey). Kadmon quit the band in 1979 after a short UK tour supporting Buzzcocks. Ian Devine replaced him, and the band later disbanded in 1983. Morrissey, who is a close personal friend of Sterling's, remains one of the group's biggest fans. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ludus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
