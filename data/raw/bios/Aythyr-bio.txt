From Perth Western Australia comes Aythyr. Formed by Dave Sandstrom, known for his work on bass for Pathogen and Vespers Descent, in 2008 as a concept to merge the music he loves with the idealology of mysticism which he studies. The soon to be released , Through the Ages is his first effort. Recorded at Nightwind Studios as he writes the songs, it is clear indication of his intent to provide a listening experiance that will broaden and mature with each release. Though lacking vocals for now, work is under way to fill this void as is the completion of the album.
The music is still trying to find its feet, paying homage to a variety of styles and bands, but not conforming to a set genre or style the music is described as Mystic Metal due to the content and subject matter. Some early released lyrics " I call the four winds, to aid me in this rite. Forever joined by blood and the magic of the night", from the song The Rite. And also from the newly written Within, "In this reality of the mind is a concept of divinity, which keeps us searching for a sign. Turning to the stars or reaching deep within, the answers left their mark and they turned them into sin." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aythyr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
