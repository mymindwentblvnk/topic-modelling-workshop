Formed in 2007 by PÃ¥l Callmer and Arnold Lindberg of Murderplan and Supraload. Later joined by former Embraced (rip) vocalist Kalle Nimhagen. Deathening uses both brutal and melodic influences of old-school death and thrash to perform a mix of in-your-face, technical riffs and harmonic chords and solos.

By the time of early 2009 the full length album "Open Up and Swallow" was put together and Deathening are currently looking for a label to release it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deathening">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
