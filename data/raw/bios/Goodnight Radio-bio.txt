Goodnight Radio is a project created by Shawn Christensen, this project began due to the struggle and need for a song to fit in one of the most pivotal scenes in his Oscar award winning short film "Curfew," a film that Shawn wrote, directed, and starred in. The song "Sophia So Far" was originally created only to fit the length of the scene itself until recently when Mr. Christensen and producer Kevin Seaton decided to finish the full length song in the studio. The full length song also features background vocals from his old band mates in Stellastarr* Amanda Tannen and Michael Jurin. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Goodnight+Radio">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
