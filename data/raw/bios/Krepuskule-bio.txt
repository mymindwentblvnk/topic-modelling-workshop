Wandering between light and darkness, Krepuskule distils a melodic metal with intimate texts which explore the hidden recesses of human soul. Mixing different tones and musical types and guided by a melancholic feminine voice, Krepuskule tries to open the closed doors of our subconscious.

It is a Parisian band, born in 2002 of another band called Murmur, Richard (guitar), Renaud (bass) and Jeff (guitar) unite to give birth to another music group closer to the metal scene. Wanting to widen their musical horizon and adding their different influences, it took them a long time to find their own identity which finally came with the arrival of Guilhem (drums) and Diane (voice). Then, they started a new era with a few concerts in 2004 but they were slowed down by the departure of their bass player. 2005 was a year of artistic maturation and was marked by the arrival of its new bassist, Remi. In 2006, Ana joins the band, adding a deepest dimension to the atmosphere with her violin.
