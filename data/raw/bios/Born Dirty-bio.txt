London-based producers, Son of Kick and Linden Jay, are announcing a new collaborative project, Born Dirty, this week with the release of their first single, “Don’t Stop Get It”, featuring blazing vocals from the one and only Kid Sister.

Blending elements of Hip Hop via Kid Sister’s tireless flow with tinges of Garage percussion and booming Bassline straight from the UK, Son of Kick and Linden Jay have created a vocal-driven thumper with peak time play set in its crosshairs. On working with Son of Kick and the esteemed Chicago rapper, Linden Jay explains, “Working with Son Of Kick on these new Born Dirty tracks has been a blast. We have such a wide array of influences and when we meet in the middle it’s a lethal combo! And it’s great to have Kid Sister on ‘Don’t Stop Get It’ – her vocals really tie it together as it’s such a quirky/unique instrumental.”
