Tyger Tyger are Adelaide’s hottest, most notorious new indie sextet. In just three short months they have shared the stage with with Jebediah, The Cops, British India, Koolism, City Riots, Sugar Army, and earned themselves spots on the Adelaide University O Ball lineup, Adelaide Fringe, and Norwood Food, Wine, and Music Festivals. 

Tyger Tyger are preparing to release their debut EP "Post Orgasm Depression" in the coming months. Fronted by the blunt-eyed Travis Williamson and his favorable knight in black denim, Mick Armstrong- Tyger Tyger are a catchy combination of indie-funk, and the words of a generation where post-orgasm depression is a genuine concern. Culled from diaries and text messages, Williamson’s lyrics are blunt ruminations on sex, love, friends, family, drug abuse and the day to day of Australian life. Mannix the drummer, and his off-sider percussionist, Shane, lock into dancey syncopated grooves while Tim, for all his Jazz influence, brings some serious funk on the bass. 

"A "fuck you" lyrical belligerency, with a confused latin swing... One FUCK of a live band! This shit rocks!" - SPOZ’s blogspot 

The two guitarists, Nick and Mick, are sharp as knives and play with the immediacy of a car accident at peak hour. However, on Tyger Tyger’s lighter, more reflective tracks, they place heavy emphasis on vocal harmony and you will hear more of a John Frusciante and Beatles influence in the guitars. Though you will hear elements of indie, funk, punk, psych, electro and country in their sound, their themes are fresh, and their lyrical standpoint completely unique. You’ve never heard it put like this before.
