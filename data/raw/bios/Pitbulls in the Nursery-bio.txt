Pitbulls In The Nursery are a band founded in Rambouillet, France, near Paris.

In 2001, they went professional, releasing their 3-track demo IMPACT, signed Alexis Ph√©lipot. This marked a major turning point in the Pitbulls' career.

On IMPACT, echoes of Dying Fetus, Death, Atheist and Meshuggah all combine to forge a unique PITN kaleidoscope of sounds. The initial run of 200 copies soon sold out. A further 500 were then produced, enabling PITN to fuel their publicity.

PITN have clocked up over 50 gigs throughout Europe -35 in the year 2003-2004 alone. They have shared the bill with some of the greatest metal bands of the moment : Aborted, Gojira, Gronibard, Kaizen, No Return, Yyrkoon, Korum, Klone, Benighted, Trepalium ... And played at prestigious venues such as : LA LOCO in Paris, L'USINE in Geneva.

With this success, the group are eager to do more gigs, bring their music to an ever-growing audience and deliver a show that is increasingly accomplished.

The release of their first album, LUNATIC (2005), the fruit of three weeks' labour in the Des Milans recording studios and engineered by Jean-Pierre Bouquet, heralds a new point of departure...
