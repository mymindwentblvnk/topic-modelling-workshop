Wrathful Plague was founded in December of 2005 as a solo old-school black metal project by Nostaun. In April of '06, Wavy Svendersuhn (LSP, Glaciial, Agothothodion) joined the band and soon WP signed to E.E.E. Recordings. Wrathful Plague's discography includes their minimalistic debut album "The Frostbitten Path" (2006) and their most recent release "Bitter Forest Winds" (2007) which marks an immense step forward both musically and production wise. Wrathful Plague's black hymns work to create a cold, raw and medieval atmophere, which recalls the older music of bands such as Ildjarn, Satyricon and Judas Iscariot with influences ranging from Tolkien's World to Germanic/Norse Paganism. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wrathful+Plague">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
