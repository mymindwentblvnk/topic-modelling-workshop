Master's Hammer are an occult black metal band from the Czech Republic, founded by Franta Storm. They were founded in 1987 and produced several demos, before releasing their debut album Ritual in 1991. A year later they completed Jilemnice Occultist - the first black metal operreta. Their 1995 album Šlágry was a drift away from the previous work incorporating many styles outside the metal genre. All of their lyrics are written in the Czech language.  After a long hiatus, the band has reformed.  The new album Mantras was self-released in late 2009, then, in 2012, they self-released album called "Vracejte konve na místo". In 2013 they released their 1991 album Ritual on vinyl, demos recorded from 1987 to 1992 as a 3CD digipak and a split with Blackosh via their own music label called Jihosound Records, founded in same year. Next year another 7" split with Blackosh and a new full-length album called Vagus Vetus had been released. The band promised that "If you'll like it, the vinyl shall follow this autumn."
