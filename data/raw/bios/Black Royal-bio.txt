Black Royal is a Finnish sludge metal band from Tampere, Finland.

Black Royal was founded in the spring of 2013 to create music that hadn't been played much in Finland but was what the guys in the band would’ve wanted to listen. The group shared an urge to play crushingly heavy, blackened declamation.
From the start the idea was to combine different styles of heavy music from the 70’s metal to more current sludge and death metal stylings. Later on also influences of doom metal have been tossed in the mix. Adding epic choruses and unconventional arrangements has also become band`s trademark.
Black Royal is inspired by primitivity, heaviness and lively natural soundscape. Someone (accurately) described band’s music as “Death Blues”.
Swedish-Finnish label Suicide Records signed Black Royal in late 2016. The first release was a 7” vinyl / digital single “Dying Star” in spring of 2017. “Dying Star” was also the first single released from the 2018 album “Lightbringer”.
Black Royal will release their, already really good reviews received, new album "Lightbringer" on 9.3.2018 on vinyl, CD and digital worldwide.
