Jens Lissat doesn't really need an introduction; insiders call him the "German godfather of techno". His eclectic career started 15 years ago with clubanthems like "Work the House-Sound", "Who is Elvis", "Der Erdbeermund" and his biggest success, the Interactive Remake "Forever Young", which still graces his studio in the form of a golden record. If "dirty Lissat" counts it right he could call more than 130 releases his own. 

Voltaxx keeps himself more in the background, though he's definately no "inconnu". His unbelievable "Sexy Girl" Remix for 2raumwohnung brought everybody on the dancefloor. Remixes for Sinead O'Connor, Benny Benassi, Raptile or productions like Oomph's "Gott ist ein Popstar" proove the league in which Voltaxx plays. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lissat+&+Voltaxx">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
