Natasha "Tash" Sultana (born 15th June, 1995) is an Australian singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. Described as a "one-person band who brings new meaning to the concept of multi-tasking", they are best known for their 2016 single "Jungle", which was voted into third place in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2016.

Sultana initially made a name for themself busking on the streets of Melbourne and having homemade videos go viral getting millions of views online. Since having their hands wrapped around a guitar at the age of three, the self-taught artist quickly developed their own unique style that has people lining up to see them perform live. Their vocal shines with a magical quality, they have a natural gift for melody and their virtuosic guitar playing is from another planet.

Sultana sold out their entire World tour and was added to dozens of high profile festivals including Laneway 2017. Both singles ‘Jungle’ and ’Notion’ were quick to receive high rotation on national broadcaster triple j. With their six-track “Notion EP” released via their very own independent label “Lonely Lands Records”, the sky is the limit. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tash+Sultana">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
