"I was always fascinated by music. when I was six parents have signed up for piano. I was an active him six years. Then I want to play on saxophone so I went for that. On sax I played for 2 years. Then I ended up with it and I stopped all my music activities. For a few years I have devoted to other things. But again I started to be interested for music. With my friend, we agreed that we´ll produce music. We built a provisory studio in we constantly we looked for more and more technique. Quite quickly we got the first release. It was the point where we said. "we can´t stop" and we haven´t stopped. We achieved a lot of labels. In 2011 I realized that I wanted to experiment and create tunes that I wanted to add more my feelings. But soundnbeats had two members, so everyone wanted something a little different. And so it occurred to me creating your own solo project where I could fully develop.

Influences:

I do not know what it is but I always got dragged to minimalism, melodically interesting process, but also dark things. The minimalist sounds and grooves make me jizz in my pants :D So naturally I can mark a major mpact, for example: Enei, Rido, Xtrah and more other.
But Anyway I try to be original" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Minor+Rain">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
