Codebreaker is anthemic. Codebreaker is electric. Codebreaker is criminally infectious. Codebreaker is Steven Hawley and Sage Schwarm, specialists at making summer magic all year round.  An irresistible mix of the timeless, warm sound of funk with exciting modern extrapolations on disco, italo, electro, filter house & more..
Their last 12" single, “Follow Me” quickly caught the attention of world-class taste makers including The Juan MacLean (DFA/NYC), Bottin (Italians Do It Better/Venice), and The Outrunners (Valerie/FR), all of who gave the single remix treatments.  A brief time before that, came the critically acclaimed double 12" single, "Fire" feat. UK disco diva Kathy Diamond.
Since releasing their first full-length, “Exiled!” in 2007, which elicited praise from the likes of The Washington Post and Pitchfork, Codebreaker proves more & more that its uncontainable mix is anything but ordinary. This may seem hard to believe for two guys making disco inspired tracks in the midwest but, for Hawley and Schwarm, life off the beaten track actually seems to be a key to success.  By meticulously deconstructing what they “love about the music we love,” Hawley and Schwarm create a sound that is equal parts light and dark by balancing the clean, cool sophistication of electro with the playful passion of disco, while always throwing a little funky swagger into everything they do. 
Citing influences such as Chic and The Pet Shop Boys, Codebreaker look to the past and the music they love to help them push their sound into the future. Frontman/brainchild, Steven Hawley is quick to point out that many of his major influences, particularly 70’s funk and soul greats, “came out of really unlikely places."   “We live on our own planet & think in epic proportion ”  Hawley says of his and Schwarm’s creative process. 
2010 is already proving to be an especially strong for the duo, with signature remixes for Miami Horror & Thieves Like Us spreading like wildfire across the blogosphere and playlists, a new EP, collaborations & even more remixes soon on the way, Codebreaker's breaking out, blazing their own distinctive brand of dance music that grabs you like a new best friend, and doesn't let you go anytime before sunrise.
