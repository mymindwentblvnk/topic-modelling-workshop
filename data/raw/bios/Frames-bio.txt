There are 3 bands with the name 'Frames'.

1. A german post-rock band

2. A Progressive Doom metal band from Great Falls, Montana

3. An indie rock / emo band from Richmond, VA.

1. Since fall of 2007 frames create songs that take the listener on a trip through landscapes of overwhelmingly epic, thrillingly gloomy, and refreshingly clear nature. Songs without words, using only what music is capable of.
Elements of Post-Rock, Progressive Rock, Alternative-Rock and Metal melt into a mixture described by german media as "something between Bombast-, Post- and New-Art-Rock".

After releasing their debut "124ep" in spring of 2009 via DIY, the relatively young (20-24) band received an unexpected amount of attention. 
While the 6-track-E.P. was featured in over a dozen print- and online magazines, along with stunning reviews and even a europe-wide tv-feature, the german VISIONS magazine as well as the ROCK HARD magazine made it the "Demo of the Month".

Right now the band is writing new material and soon entering pre-production of their yet-to-title debut LP, recording this fall, as well as planning and booking the album-promotion-tour in 2010.
And of course the band is looking for a label to release that arising piece of music.

3. Frames is an emo-pop band based out of Richmond, VA. Founded by Sarah Phung in 2019 as a solo project, as of 2021 the band is a four-piece playing 90s-influenced indie rock. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Frames">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
