Emerging From The Cocoon bring forth an infectious brand of heavy hitting metal music. They do this by crossing the lines of Death Metal and Deathcore while boasting plenty of technicality and energy. This highly talented five-piece band has a destructive nature to them and it shows as they consistently crush ear drums song after song. Theyâ€™ve been honing their craft since their birth in the city of Taipei back in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Emerging+from+the+Cocoon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
