Blodkaldt is a new band who's adding itself to the metal and black metal scene in Norway. Blodkaldt plays a distinctive mixture of metal and black metal with elements of pure extreme attitude and anti religious relations. The band was founded by Gravskrot Kistekrist and Mugglik in 2007, and has since then recorded songs and worked on creating that distinctive sound in their own studio, but it wasn't until 2009 Blodkaldt decided to release their first demo. In May 2009, the band held auditions to find a drummer, and in June Kimfindir joined Blodkaldt on permanent basis.
In June, Blodkaldt finally self released their first demo ''DEMO 2009'' in 100 limited hand-numbered copies.
