UK rock band playing a 70's hard rock sound.

Taken from http://www.metalchaos.co.uk/ :

Having one of the most original / unusual names in Heavy Metal is one way of getting people to notice you I suppose. There aren’t too many bands whose name is synonymous with an 18th Century Admiral of the Fleet that is for sure, so it’s with interest that I listened to the new 7” for the Sussex trio, “Return To Zero”.

Being signed to Rise Above Records is usually a safe indication as to the style and overall sound you’re about to experience, and true to form I wasn’t disappointed. Billed as no “classic rock' revivalist's”, Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell certainly do hark back to the days of early Sabbath, Rainbow and Deep Purple. The production quality has that aged feel to it which just enhances both songs impact.

Lead by guitarist and vocalist Johnny Gorilla, another unusual name to throw into the mix, provides an earthiness to the songs with his vocals which while not out of the Gillian or Dio book owe more to traditional Metal than anything we’re seeing out there today. Akin to Sir Lord Baltimore, “Day After Day” and title track “Return To Zero” are at their essence unadulterated fun, and the best complement I could pay is that they’re likely to appeal to all Hard Rock, Heavy Metal or whatever it is we call this music these days. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Admiral+Sir+Cloudesley+Shovell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
