Los Angeles Hard Rockers SACRED CHILD issued a self titled opus, 'Sacred Child', produced by Chuck Rosa and featuring a cover version of BAD COMPANY's 'Rock Steady', through Target Records in 1987. Vocalist Astrid Young, who features on the album, is the sister of Grunge icon NEIL YOUNG. Before relocating from her native Canada, Young had fronted THE ASTRID YOUNG BAND, featuring a pre-INFERNAL MAJESTY guitarist Kenny Hallman.

Young replaced David Reece who would later join ACCEPT, BANGALORE CHOIR and SIRCLE OF SILENCE. By the time the album was released SACRED CHILD had already split with bassist Geoff Patterson, a man who had co-written the majority of the record with guitarist Chuck Rosa. The album was originally recorded with a male frontman before he was replaced with Astrid. Guitarist Chuck Rosa produced many 80''s Metal albums for bands such as: Laaz Rockit, LA Guns, Viking, Predator, and Abattoir.
