1) Lo Fi Dungeon Synth from Alessandria, Italy. https://wistfull.bandcamp.com/

2) Wistful was born in late April 2010 in Portugal from the hands and mind of A. It comes as a second incarnation, or as an evolution of his former project Arges, breaking farther away from typical black metal. Although retaining some elements of the genre as base, it builds upon that to create something... Not so black metal.
Wistful embodies above anything else the cathartic process of coping with some events and the necessity of expunging a myriad of feelings bottled inside...
Some people keep a written diary, this is a "musical diary" put into practice by A. Although music is all written by him, lyrics are shared between his own and the words of some others, close to him. Their verse translated perfectly his feelings, better than he would be able to put into words. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wistful">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
