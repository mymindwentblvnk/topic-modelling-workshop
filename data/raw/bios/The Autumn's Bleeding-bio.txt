THE AUTUMN’S BLEEDING is a Hardcore influenced Death Metal Band from Göttingen, Germany, that exists since winter 2005/2006. From the beginning this band was always about the love for music and nothing else. Their goal isn’t to be the toughest or heaviest band out there. They just play the music they love and grew up with. That’s why you can find their influences reaching from Death, Black and Heavy Metal to Old School Metalcore and all kinds of Hardcore.

The guitars are mixing heavy, rhythm orientated riffing with a lot of melody, which is a definite trademark of THE AUTUMN’S BLEEDING, whilst the drumming is very versatile and combines groove-laden beats with heart-stopping blasts and double-bass-attacks. Finally, the vocalist unites ultra-low growls, aggressive screams and tough guy shouts.
