After some projects that preceded the formation of the band, the members L. Bergelmir (Lucas H.) on the guitars and vocals, I. Bellhharar (Igor A.) on the drums and F. Fenrir (Felipe M.) on the keyboards and synthesizers, joined with a serious proposal of work. The bandâ€™s name ''Zargof" is based on a metaphysic archetype idealized by L. Bergelmir and I. Bellhharar, that permeates the genesis and the fall of all elements. Bergelmir, F. Fenrir e Bellhharar composed the first horde songs and the 1st work called "Departure For The Cosmic Twilight" was recorded. This work, such well produced and elaborated, containing five songs, surrendered a very positive return from critics and public. It feautured classic symphonic black metal for a total of 22 minutes. An immersive landscape of majestic darkness similar to that of early Emperor.  

After the release conclusion, in July of 2004, the band had no musicians stabilization for some positions and the keyboarder (F. Fenrir) left the band. In the year of 2006, the bassist T.Ares (Erebo) joined the crew, the band reformulated their musical intentions, and after the joining of Chupa Cabra as the guitarrist, the group decided to play with new elements. Nowadays the whole band is engaged in the production of the second release, which will count with great musical productions. The natural musical evolution of the group and the power of the new formation evokes Zargof's myth in the places of glory.
