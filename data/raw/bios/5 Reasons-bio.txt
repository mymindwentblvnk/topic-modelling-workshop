Stanislav Lukoyanov, aka 5 Reasons, is a 16 year old Russian producer from Moscow. He first made hip hop instrumentals for independent artists before turning towards nu-disco in 2012. In his search for a new inspiration, he looked into his father's record collection and started composing his own disco tunes. 
After releasing several tracks on various labels, he is now presenting his latest production "Night Drive In Moscow". This time, 5 Reasons created a very unique atmosphere by mixing mysterious vibes with a real disco feel. 

The vocals by the talented American singer Patrick Baker add the final touch to this remarkable piece. 
The release also includes two remixes: one by the very promising Mexican producer Bronx, and the other by a major artist of the nu-disco scene, Satin Jackets. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/5+Reasons">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
