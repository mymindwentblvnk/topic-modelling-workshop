The band was founded in Parma (Italy) in 2008 and, after some line-up adjustements, in 2011 released their first studio work: the EP "Cold Embrace". 
Following the widespread approval from the critics and the fans, the following year AVELION started an incessant Live activity, also having the great opportunity to play as opening act for Seventh Wonder (with Tommy Karevik, Kamelot), while at the same time a strong and ever-growing fanbase has developed worldwide.
In 2012 the band also released the promotional single "Falling Down" which sees the collaboration with guitarist Olaf Thorsen (Labyrinth, Vision Divine). 
AVELION's second EP, "Liquid Breathing", was published in November 2013, followed by a mini-tour in Austria, Czech Republic and Slovakia. The EP delivers a more personal, modern and mature sound: here we can find, in fact, a Melodic Progressive Metal mixed with Djent influences, all combined with a strong Electronic personality.
In 2015, with Oreste Giacomini and William Verderi as masterminds and main composers, the band entered Domination Studio of Simone Mularoni (DGM) to record their first full length album: “Illusion Of Transparency”.
“Illusion Of Transparency” will be out on April 7th, 2017 via Revalve Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Avelion">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
