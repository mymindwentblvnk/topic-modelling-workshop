This band take their cues from the Hard Rock and Metal bands who flourished in abundance in the '80s. It's fairly obvious that Mrs. Hippie follow vocal hints from Ozzy Osbourne, as the singer's high-pitched, whiney voice is somewhat thin and prone to vibrating falsettos. The songs aren't so much bad as they are dated.
