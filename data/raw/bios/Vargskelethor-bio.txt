Joel Varg Jarvison (also known as Vargskelethor, exinthevatican, Uncle Joel or Jobel/Jorgel/Joge/Jotles/Jontel/Jorgrel/Jeorl/Jül/Jegg/ Smoglin/Groglin/Jenkem the 3rd/Scrungle/Jib/Dingoss/Brenkin/Stimble/ Bonglin/Tinkle/Frengden/Jogger/Xylene/Oel/ no.333/JoJo/HAM/Expand Dong/Swedish Vinny/Hoel/Joe/Boel) is the second-most popular streamer on Vinesauce, next to Vinny himself. Hailing from the freezing realms of Umeå (Sweden), he is known for his incredibly bizarre childhood, teenage experiences, Windows Destruction and DOS madness streams. He is a fan of death metal, MIDI music, skeletons, and "Manime," such as Fist of the North Star and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

He has a popular livestream series, Windows Destruction, where he sets up a Virtual Machine with a version of Windows and attempts to fill it up with malware to the point where it is unusable. This has proved difficult on Mac emulations.
