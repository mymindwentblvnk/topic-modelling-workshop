Hailing from Scotland rather than sunny Alaska, Matanuska play a form of heavy, guitar-driven, controversy-infused, progressive groove metal that only Matanuska can deliver. This "beefy as f***" 3-piece are not afraid of a somber moment or two, but even their more delicate moments are often laced with vulgarity.

Whether it be an 8 minute epic about the deranged love between a man and his daughter..., or a thunderous ride through the mind of a demented mass murderer, Matanuska have got you covered.

Currently at work on their highly anticipated debut album, tentatively due for an early 2014 release, Matanuska are not a band to take lightly.
