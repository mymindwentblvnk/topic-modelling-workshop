There are multiple bands of the same name:

1) Accidental Suicide was an old school death metal band from Wisconsin,USA. They formed in 1989 by  Ed Jackson (Vocals),  Bill Mears (Guitars), Travis Staedter (Guitars), Steve Fera (Bass) and Chris Kinkerski  (Drums).

2) Accidental Suicide is a Thrash metal band from Germany. The band was founded in december 2005 by Aldi, Scheia and Spike. For about 3 years the guys played with a drum-computer and wrote own songs, which they recorded in their rehearsal room. In 2008 a demo was recorded with a friend of the band who is a trained sound engineer. The demo contained 6 tracks, still recorded with programmed drums and was only available at some gigs and for friends of the band, but it was never released officially. In early 2009 Schore joined Accidental Suicide as their new drummer, and the guys finally found their musical style: Thrash metal with lots of influences from heavy metal, hard rock, with grooves and melodies and with the kick ass energy and the "fuck you!"-attitude of punk rock. In october 2011 the band recorded their first demo with full line-up at the Never Ending Music Studio in Regensburg. The four-track-ep was mixed and mastered in november and december and was released in january 2012. They play a mix of thrash metal, heavy metal and punk, with lots of melodic elements and guitar harmonies, for example in the style of Iron Maiden. Although the base of their sound is thrash metal, the band didnÂ´t want to become another retro copy of Slayer, Anthrax or Metallica, but to combine all possible musical influences from the huge variety of heavy metal music.
