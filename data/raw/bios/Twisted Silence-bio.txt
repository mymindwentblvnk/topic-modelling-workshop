Twisted Silence is melodic metal band from Kuopio, Finland.

First there was guitar and J. Comulainen. Then there was nothing... For a while, until the first demo came! J. Comulainen made these demo songs at summer 2002 at Jortsi´s Viinipanimo- home studio by himself. Those songs were dropping into the X- files first, but J. Comulainen decided to not to bury`em. He asked Corpse ( Deathchain ,  Trollheims grott ,  De lirium's order ) to make vocals to the songs.

Finally two ugly guys went to the Bassment studio, and vocals was recorded by Petja Turunen ( MC Raaka Pee , from  Turmion kätilöt ). At that time, Twisted Silence was group, which contained only two members. Nowadays Corpse is no more in TW.
