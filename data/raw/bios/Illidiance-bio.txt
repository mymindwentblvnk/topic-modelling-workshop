Illidiance is a industrial metal band from Taganrog, Russia, formed in 2004.

The Band was founded in 2004 as the successor of the black metal band S.C.A.R.D., which was active from 1999 to 2003. llidiance released an album and an EP, before switching to a more electronically influenced sound with their 2009 EP Synthetic Breed when they abandoned the black metal motives and oriented to the cyber metal genre. The following year the band continued even further in this direction while incorporating lyrical themes such as transhumanism, artificial intelligence and armageddon in their 2010 album Damage Theory.

Recently the band had stepped away from the cyber metal genre and is now describing their music as just modern alternative metal while experimenting with new lyrical themes.

The band released their 4th studio album The Iconoclast on May 19, 2019 after over 8 years from their previous studio album Damage Theory. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Illidiance">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
