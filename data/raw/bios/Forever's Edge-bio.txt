Quote from the band's MySpace Page:

Fresh on the prog power scene, Forever’s Edge, formed by guitarist Salvatore Pisano (ex-Into the Dementia), is supported by a power house of musicians in such bands as (Suspyre/ Empyreon/ Structure Of Inhumanity & Dividing Light)

As early as 2006, Salvatore Pisano started writing songs for their first album “Chaotic Silence”. In 2008, with the bar raised, and production value substantially increased “Chaotic Silence” began its evolution. Forever’s Edge music appeals to fans of Evergrey, Sonata Arctica, Stratovarius, Adagio, Serenity, and Suspyre.

“Chaotic Silence” showcases the combined talents and influences of the band. The album was produced and mixed by Erypsus Studios in Flemington, New Jersey.

Sal Pisano gives us insight into the album’s creation, “Chaotic Silence is an overture, not simply of music but of life. Conceptual, it is a collection of stories that metaphorically create a semblance of experiences we as people go through: triumph, dissatisfaction, mourning, joy, love, and hate.”

The band is already writing and producing their second album and hope to play gigs around the world in support of their music.
