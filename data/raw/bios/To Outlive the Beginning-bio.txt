To Outlive The Beginning is a 5-piece thrash/metal/hardcore/metalcore band out of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania that has been around since early 2004. Coming from a depressed former coal area, To Outlive The Beginning rises above it all to bring the listener songs that are sincere, positive, and fun. Those are three adjectives you do not usually see in a metal band. However, To Outlive The Beginning are not your average brutal metal band. With influences ranging from Darkest Hour to Texas Is The Reason, the band is not afraid to incorporate something new if it means that it will add something of substance to a song. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/To+Outlive+The+Beginning">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
