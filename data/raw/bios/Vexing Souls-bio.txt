Vexing Souls started in 2007 as a husband and wife duo . . . the result of many years of musical experimentation by Steve Burris. 
Incorporating heavy guitar, bass, keyboards and drum machines, the music took on a melodic-metal sound with gothic influences. 
It's good and creepy!

Steve constructed a home-studio in order to focus on creating his own unique style of original music. The clean, melodic vocals 
and thought-provoking lyrics are written and performed by Judy Burris. Many of the songs have a double meaning, so listen closely 
and see if you can pick them out.

After the release of their first album, Vexing Souls was joined by drummer Chris Voynovich in 2008, who will replace the drum 
machines previously used on the "Shadows of the Past" album. With the addition of bass guitar player Rob Mounce, the band is 
finally complete and busy preparing for live performances, as well as writing new material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vexing+Souls">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
