TOKYO YANKEES
xxx EXTREME NOISY ROCK 'N' ROLL xxx
SINCE 1989

TOKYO YANKEES is a Japanese metal band, that was formed in 1988, signed to X JAPAN's YOSHIKI's Extasy Records label and distributed by Sony Music. 

They used to be X's roadies before forming the band. An absolute head-banging hard rock band, they are still around nowadays without changing a bit of their style. Drummer U.D.A. and former bassist Ami played in thrash metal-band Rommel. When the band played live on a gigantic festival in Japan, 1991, members from X Japan joined them for a few songs. TOKYO YANKEES released seven full-length studio albums between 1991 and 2004. In 2008, the band released their first dvd, named "20 And Alive".
