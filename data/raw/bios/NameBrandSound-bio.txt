NameBrandSound is the latest incarnation of London music legends IG Culture and Alex Phountzi (Bugz in the Attic) - pioneers of the broken beat scene and were key players in it's flagship night at Plastic People, Co-Op. A beacon for people who wanted to dance to great music, Co-Op was a towering high point of electronic music in the capital.

NameBrandSound’s music thus consists of the influences you might expect; dancehall, ‘80s soul, jungle, juke and house. What emerges, though, is more than the sum of its parts. Nowadays Pressure is a hugely refreshing, invigorated EP of electronic songs. Heavy and light, pummelling and caressing, emotive and tough, this is the sound of masters at work. The pair dub the sound ‘pressure;’ a rough meets smooth aesthetic that injects London’s bass music energy to the spirit of Metalheadz’ D’n’B-with-feeling and Massive Attack’s infectious mood <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/NameBrandSound">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
