Hand Habits is an American indie band based in Los Angeles whose only permanent member is American musician Meg Duffy (born in Upstate New York). The first release was a 2012 split record titled Small Shifts (included as part of the pinky demos). In 2015, Hand Habits released double EPs titled This Sounds Like Nothing Tonight and This Sounds Like Nothing Before.

The first full length record, "Wildly Idle (Humble Before the Void)", was released by Woodsist Records in 2017. This followed time on the road and in the studio with pacific northwest band Mega Bog, and the Kevin Morby Band. Tracked in an Upstate New York living room, then finished in Los Angeles. A bit like many bedroom-recordings before it (such as The Microphones, Jessica Pratt, Little Wings, Grouper), Kevin Morby said "Wildly Idle feels incredibly intimate, like a secret between her and the listener". 

On March 1, 2019 Hand Habits released their second studio album, placeholder. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hand+Habits">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
