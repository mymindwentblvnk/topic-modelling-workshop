It was time of the autumn moon in the year 2003 in Raahe Finland when Ojalehto and Ahola got the idea of founding a folk metal band to awake something old that was forgotten and honour the nature in our way. We started to make songs and write lyrics for this band. Soon we made up the name "Vigrid" that represents to us the oldtimes when our ancestors were part of the nature and believed that each man chooses his own paths to walk . So we decided to make a demo in our own amateur studio called "Gjaller". After two months of work we had accomplished our first demo in December and it was named "Anxious Soul".

Time went by and many things happened. Members changed and moved on like wanderers. In the summer of 2004 Vigrid mainly moved to Mikkeli and found the crew to preach about the Mother Earth and so we started practising. Everythings was going great.. Labels desired us under their wings and of course we were blinded by happines and of course we made the wrong choises. Sparks of hope faded away and we sailed to oblivion.

In summer 2005 Ahola said that he will not continue and that killed our spark of hope even more. We summoned forward with the strenght of brotherhood of beer and a few good songs. Mikko and Tipi Nokelainen joined the band and finally we went to practise. Everyone was smiling and everything looked beautiful from the eyes of the drunken ones.

At last we have found VigridÂ´s own athmosphere to honour the nature and we will go to studio in January to record our debut album. It will be published through Deviance records at the time of summer 2006.

Time goes by, things will change and someone might wander but Vigrid marches on. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vigrid">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
