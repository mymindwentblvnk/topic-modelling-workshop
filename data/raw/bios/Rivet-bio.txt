Shrouded in anonymity the masked Rivet surfaced in 2011 with two stand out EPs on Frozen Border sub label Naked Index. A remix for Bristolian starlet Kowton on Danish imprint Teal Recordings and his “Amid The Roar” EP for the excellent Kontra-Musik, complete with a Marcel Fengler Redefinition soon followed. Rivet’s rugged and distinguished take on techno has already garnered support from Martyn, Pariah, Blawan, Skudge and Scuba who commissioned “Slant” and “Running” for his celebrated DJ Kicks compilation. In a succinct career Rivet has showcased his ability to produce bruising slabs of club techno infused with such fervour that he is almost peerless. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rivet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
