BIO
Constructed in the summer of 2010, Smaragos is a two-piece exploration of avant-garde cacophony. Partners in progressive, technical death metal giants Son of Aurelius, project architect Max Zigman and vocalist Riley McShane bring together influences ranging from the heaviest of heavy music to the most sublime of compositions of the last 700 years. Zigman assembles the mixture as both musician and studio engineer with exquisite attention to the details of recording, programming, mixing and mastering. McShane's vocal stylings help define the musical and lyrical themes of the Smaragos sound. 

Released on March 29, 2011, the self-titled E.P. Smaragos also invites the talents of Ivan Munguia (Brain Drill/Arkaik), Alan "Sitar" Brown, and Michael De Martino to contribute to a sum that truly is greater than its parts.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Smaragos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
