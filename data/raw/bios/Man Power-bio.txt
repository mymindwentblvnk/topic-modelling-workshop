Man Power’s real identity is something which he is very protective about.
Since appearing from seemingly nowhere, via accounts on Soundcloud and Facebook, Man Power has proceeded to grab attention via his self produced music videos, and his mixes for taste makers such as Test Pressing, The Ran$om Note, Throne of Blood records and Correspondant.
The Man Power sound is brooding and layered with pathos, but with a strong and ever present underpinning of dancefloor groove, and a notable sense of humour, as well as a touch of nostalgia.
His mixes showcase a prodigiously broad range of music, from obscure Italo-oddities, to shoegaze, electro and balearica, but they also contain a very healthy serving of brand new, often pre-release, house and techno, which has only served to deepen the speculation as to his real identity.
Is he an unknown, or is Man Power simply an alias for an already established artist?
…and more to the point, should it matter, or should he simply be judged by the quality of his output so far?
