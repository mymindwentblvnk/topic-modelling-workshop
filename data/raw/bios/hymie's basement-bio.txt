A collaboration of anticon and cLOUDDEAD singer, lyricist, rapper producer Why? (aka Yoni Wolf) and singer, turntabalist, guitarist Andrew Broder, aka Fog released in 2003 via Lex Records.

Combining elements of Rap, Folk and Indie, the two men have created a superb thinking man's melodic hip hop record. Songs range from the happy pop like chorus of '21st Century Pop Song' and the minimal sadness of 'Lightning Bolts and Man Hands'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hymie%27s+Basement">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
