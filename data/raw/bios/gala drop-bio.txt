Born out of the Portuguese music scene, Gala Drop is a project comprised of Lisbon's foremost underground agitator and patron for all creative sound endeavors Nelson Gomes, full time DJ, label owner and Loosers member Tiago Miranda and hyperactive drummer and percussionist Afonso Sim√µes.
Touring Europe in 2008 for the second time (first was with Excepter in 2005), their music has evolved into a blend of tribal/latin-American influenced rhythms, kraut-rock synthesizer jams and much more.
Their debut album was released in 2008. The second album, 'Broda', was released in 2012.
