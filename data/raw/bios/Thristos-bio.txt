Formed in Romania (Sibiu, Transylvania) in 1996, when Boke (guitar, vocal) and Paul (drums) experimented the black/death sound in a classroom from their High school. In 1998, with Livache (guitar) and Motley (bass), they recorded a demo: "The Beginning". After some few live appearances, in 2000 Boke transforms Thristos in one man's band and records some new songs. Since 2001, the band stopped to exist, until 2007, when Thristos reborns as an answer to several requests made by friends when is recorded a new demo (Demo 2007). It continues to be a one man's band.
