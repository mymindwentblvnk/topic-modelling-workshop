"One day I, The Anti-Ben, was bored. So I took shit. When all was well and wiped I wrote some songs. We are at war with Ben! If you're name is Ben we hate you and will destroy you! We play True Necro Country Jazz Grind Funk(you) Thrash Black Death metal madness that will obliterate your ass just like your dad!
We are looking for labels to release our material, distros to sell/trade for our stuff, and zines to review our stuff. If you are any of these and are interested (and of course, your name isn't Ben) then please contact us." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anti-Ben">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
