Altar of Plagues was an Irish post-black metal band formed in 2006 in Cork, Ireland. Terms that are most frequently used to describe their sound include black metal, ambient and progressive metal or post-metal, though it seems no one description can sum up the act's massive sound. The act themselves consider black metal to be the genre to which they are most attached, but on the contrary they have also been quoted to take influence from acts as diverse as Emperor, Björk and Arvo Pärt.

The band's untraditional aesthetic and approach to their music has led to Altar of Plagues appealing to a wide variety of listeners and this may be seen by the diverse range of acts Altar of Plagues have toured with, including Isis and Mayhem, as well as having appeared at festivals that focus on extreme metal and festivals that encourage experimentation and diversity.

In June 2013, the band announced via Facebook that they were splitting up and their final live performance would be at the Unsound Festival in Poland in October.
