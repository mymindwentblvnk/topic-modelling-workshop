Recently signed to LOAD Recordings, Zombie Recordings and one of the worlds most respected drum and bass labels, Trouble on Vinyl. SFR aka Julian Joseph’s tracks have received love from some of the most well respected deejays around the globe. This bright South African Talent has developed a fresh and funky outlook on drum and bass, and has opened a new insight to the way the rainbow nation is depicted on the drum and bass map.

SFR not only delivers in the studio, his talent carries over to the decks with his exceptional crowd control and ability to create dance floor momentum which evidently won him the 2006 True Playaz mix contest. Having held the fort alongside some of the scene’s most respected DJ’s, and successfully performing all around his home country, as well as England, France, Belgium, Germany and Sweden, he is clearly a force to be reckoned with. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SFR">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
