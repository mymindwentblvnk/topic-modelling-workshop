Shivaree was a three-person American band formed in 1999 consisting of Ambrosia Parsley (vocals), Danny McGough (keyboards), and Duke McVinnie (guitar). They produced four full-length albums (only two of which enjoyed a North American release due to contract disagreements) and have approximately 500,000 combined sales to their name. They credit numerous other musicians in their work and are usually joined by two or three other collaborators when performing live. Their song Goodnight Moon was used in the Quentin Tarantino movie 'Kill Bill Vol. 2.'

Their final album, a collection of covers, was released in 2007, after which they disbanded. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shivaree">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
