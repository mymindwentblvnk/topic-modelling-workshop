Arbitrary is a Heavy Metal band from Huntsville, Alabama. They were formed in Summer of 2005 by Stephen Hughes, Parker Wolcott, Eric Hansson, and Alex Wolcott. Chino Austin joined as the singer in the Fall of '07,  letting Hughes concentrate solely on bass, instead of playing bass as well as singing. Since their beginning, they have recorded 2 demos - The Demo, and The Demo of Destiny of Death! - but The Demo was never released due to exceptionally poor recording quality.

They will be going in to the studio soon to record their first full-length album. It will feature the songs from The Demo of Destiny of Death!, and 4-5 new ones. Look for it to be released in the summer of '09. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arbitrary">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
