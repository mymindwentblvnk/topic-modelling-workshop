Formed in 1989 by former Suckerhead's front man, Wacked on guitars and vocals, along with Jorghy on bass and Erwin on drums. Within years these three piece then renew their line up became Wacked - guitars & vocals, Jorghy - guitars, Bay - bass, Robin - drums. These formation manage to released their unforgettable anthem, the original Doomsday. At the same year Jorghy and Bay left the band to conti
nue their college, and Robin joined Suckerhead.

More changes happened next with Laurent joined the forces on guitars, James on vocals and Denny on drums also Bobby (was the vocalist and guitarist from "Crapehanger" that time) on bass. These bastards united done a lot of sickest and crazy things in the scene, even after Wacked and Laurent decided to leave the band in 1996 and followed by Bobby in the next year, they continue delivering madness to the scene.

Ricky then took over guitar position and St. Ino (previously holds guitar for Detriment) on bass to keep the musical structure remains insane. The real doomsday is happened for the band after James left the band. The monster's been sleeping for over a decade. No sign of they will ever resurrect, but no matter what Grausig has left something in the history of brutal death metal industry in their country scene, which not much other has ever managed to do the same shit ever. Musically, lifestyle, also believe.

Currently after Bobby made his short return to the local scene before passed away on October 3rd 2011, everybody sit together and put aside their ego and did some serious action regarding the awakened of this band in a reunion concert which will be held for Bobby and continue the band after the reunion concerts and blasting the scene like what they used to do previously.

This for sure confirming that the band will continue their unfinished trilogy to completed Feed The Flesh To The Beast [EP], nor Abandon, Forgotten And Rotting Alone [Full length] which succeed in previous decade. This third oncoming album entitled 'Visions Of Enslaved Upon My Lizard Side' which planning to be released in 2013 (The tittle remains the same with the unfinished material which should have released on 2001, but will contained new materials due to the original material is no longer exist).
