Harrisons were a four-piece guitar band from Hillsborough in Sheffield, England. They were one of the leading bands in the so-called New Yorkshire scene, along with fellow Sheffielders Arctic Monkeys, Milburn, The Long Blondes and Bromheads Jacket.

In 2005 they recorded a live session for Phill Jupitus' show on BBC6 Music, and played the South By Southwest festival in Texas. They have also featured many times in NME, including a feature where the band guided a journalist around their favourite Sheffield haunts, including Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

The band signed a deal with Melodic Records in 2006, and their debut album 'No Fighting In The War Room' was released on 28 January 2008, and included the singles 'Dear Constable', 'Blue Note', 'Wishing Well' and 'Monday's Arms'

The video to the band's 'Blue Note' single was based on the film Kes, and starred Phoenix Nights star Steve Edge as a Brian Glover-style PE teacher.

On 5th April 2008, a blog posted on the band's myspace confirmed the rumours of the bands split. Frontman Jubby has gone on to form 'Park Brigade' with Tim McCall, whilst Ben, Ashley and Mark have formed 'The Flying Squad' with Az Butcher and Russell McGuinness.
