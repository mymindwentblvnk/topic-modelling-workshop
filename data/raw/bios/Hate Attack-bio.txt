Hate Attack was a young hc punk band from Nova Gradiška, Croatia. In 2010. Vedran and Igor started with the idea of having a metal band and the hope to revive the alternative scene in Nova Gradiška. The idea didn't work out so well, and a few months later Vedran joined forces with Borna and started playing punk. Soon enough Igor joined them on bass, and afterwords Marijan on vocals and Pavle on second guitar. By the end of the year they already had some local gigs behind them and were in studio recording their first EP. In summer of 2011. they entered the studio again to record new songs. In the meantime, Igor left the band and Pavle took over bass. They decided to change the band name to "Wise up". Their first EP under that name was finished by the end of the year. In the meantime Domagoj joined on second guitar. They've changed their style to melodic hardcore. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hate+Attack">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
