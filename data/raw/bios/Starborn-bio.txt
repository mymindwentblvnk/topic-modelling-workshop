1) Starborn is a heavy/power metal band from the UK, blending the US and European schools of the genre with eighties attitude, and of course their own style. The band's debut demo 'Born By The Wind' was released independently in August 2014, as well as released on limited edition Cassette tape by Swords & Chains Records in October 2014. An upcoming EP release 'The Dreaming City' will soon be released as part of Stormspell Records' Trend Killers series.
