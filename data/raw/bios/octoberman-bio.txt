Fortresses (2009) – Octoberman’s third full-length – saw Marc Morrissette and his band distancing themselves further from any notion of comfort or security. While the evocative title certainly lent itself well to Octoberman’s formidable new sound, it also allowed the record’s frequent instances of aching vulnerability to catch an unsuspecting listener completely unaware. Marking Octoberman’s most cohesive and adventurous effort to date, Fortresses revelled in the ghosts that emerge and raw nerves that are exposed when old defences fall.

Quite appropriately, after completing an album that documented “endings” with such openness and aplomb, Morrissette brought his extended tenure in Vancouver to a close, relocating to Toronto and recruiting a new complement of players (Marshall Bureau on drums, Tavo Diez de Bonilla on bass, Randy Lee on violin, and Shaun Brodie on trumpet and keyboards) to complete the East Coast line-up.

After earning critical praise from the likes of Pitchfork, Uncut and Americana UK (Album of 2007), appearing at the SXSW, Pop Montreal, Sled Island and CMJ festivals, extensively touring North America and Europe, and being featured prominently on Grey’s Anatomy in 2010, Octoberman continues a bold new chapter built upon the sturdy foundation of Fortresses.

This next chapter begins with the 4 song Sweater EP, which will be available digitally on October 18. A 10-song LP is also set for release in 2012.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Octoberman">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
