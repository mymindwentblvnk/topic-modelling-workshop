*WARNING*
The band in which you are about to hear is an account of the tragedy which befell five youths, in particular Mike Beerdozer and his invalid brother, Wrick Gorecrusher. It is all the more tragic that they were drunk. But, had they lived very, very long lives, they could not have expected nor would they have wished to see as much of the mad and the macabre as they were to see that day. For them a idyllic summer afternoon drive became a nightmare. The events of that day were to lead to the discovery of one of the most bizarre crimes in the annals of history. The Texas Cropsy Massacre

CROPSY is a "Satantonio", Texas based Death Metal band, with heavy Thrash influences. 

Songs are usually Horror Movie influenced or based on witchcraft. There are alternate lyrics to most of the songs that are based on the writings of Robert E. Howard, which may or may not be released. 

CROPSY is rumored to have the members of the mighty Thrash/Crossover band, WOMANTHROWER, but other speculations have been made. Some people say that both bands never existed <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cropsy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
