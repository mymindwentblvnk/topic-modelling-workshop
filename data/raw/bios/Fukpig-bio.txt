Fukpig is a Birmingham, UK based crust/black metal band. Their lyrics focus mainly on war and political matters, especially the middle east invasion. They were formed as a side project in 2001 by members of Mistress and Anaal Nathrakh.

The band took a hiatus in 2004 due to commitments of members' main bands. In 2008 they got back together to record an album, Spewings From a Selfish Nation. Since then they have played a handful of gigs across the U.K, recorded a second album, 'Belief Is The Death Of Intelligence' and an E.P, 'Batcave Full Of Bastards'. They returned in 2018 to play Damnation Festival in the UK and released Bastards on June 1st.

The band have dubbed their music "necropunk". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fukpig">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
