Red Stars Parade are a British heavy rock band based in Leeds, UK. Formed in 2001, the band is made up of Matthew Dixon (vocals), Kevin Reid (drums), Matthew Newsome (bass), and Charles J. Pritchard (guitar). 

Although their sound is very much rooted in hardcore and heavy metal it is also largely influenced by indie, post-punk, noise, and art rock. Their music has also been described as having a 'progressive' or 'epic' quality.

Red Stars Parade have been likened to artists such as Deftones, Neurosis, Quicksand, Melvins, At The Drive-In, and Mastodon.

In 2004 Christmas Eve records put out a split with Among The Missing , limited to 500 copies, consisting of one track from each band, the RSP track was 'Solomon Soz' . The band's first album 'Disko' consisting of 11 tracks was released in 2005 on Dry Run Records. And in 2008 RSP released a follow up 6 track EP entitled 'Lutine Belle' on Thirty Days of Night Records.

On 18th June 2009 RSP announced they had decided to split up and move on.
