Haarp can refer to three different bands:

1) haarp is a Sludge Metal band from New Orleans who are signed to Housecore Records. They have released a 2007 demo, an EP in 2009,  their full length Housecore Records debut "The Filth" on November 23, 2010, and " Husks" on September 18, 2012. 

2) HAARP is the electronic ambient project of Mirko Ruckels (AU) and Justin Robert (US).

3) HAARP is Rudi Gottsberger, a professional musician, audio engineer and video designer who lives in Vienna, the capital city of Austria. Rudi's music is alternative, sometimes dark and controversial and intends to change something in people's minds.

The voice samples he uses refer to artistic, moralistic and political phenomenons. He tries to transport their irritating ambivalence into his music and conserve their explosiveness - reckless and tongue in cheek.

The driving forces in the background are - often modified - sounds of the animal world: crickets, frogs, the bat's sonar.
