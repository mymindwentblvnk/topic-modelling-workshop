EGEMONY is born from the ashes of ANAL PROLAPSE. 
It's a BrutalDeath Metal One-Man-Band started in the last months of 2007 by the will of Alessandro "Fetz" Simonetti who is the man behind all the guitar riffs, all the vocals lines and all the drum-programming. 
In the Beginning of the 2008 has been released the self-produced OMEGA DEMO recorded entirely by Alessandro. in October 2008 EGEMONY takes part in a 3 way split released by SEVARED RECORDS that also includes FLESH IMPALED from Northern Ireland and INFINITE DEFILEMENT from Australia. 
In the firsts months of 2009 Egemony releases, under Nice To Eat You Rec., a full length album entitled "Baptysm Of The Unborn". Nowadays Alessandro is working to create new brutal material for Egemony's second album, and is searching for a label for releasing it. New album, "Atonement", will blow away "Baptysm of The Unborn", will be faster, more brutal, more heavy, and hopefully will make you bang and smach your head off. A 2/3 songs promo album will be released in autumn to give you an idea of what atonement is going to be!
