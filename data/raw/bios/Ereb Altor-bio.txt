This epic metal band was formed in the early 90's by the sole two members still making up Ereb Altor. Growing up having Bathory's epic era in our hearts it was inevitable that the music we created somehow was going to be influenced by our house gods. Having Bathory's music as a foundation we created our own branch of this so called "epic viking metal" genre. Lyric-wise the topics differed slightly.

After a break lasting over a decade due to being busy with other bands we decided to breathe life into this sleeping beauty. A recording was done late 2003 with some of the over ten years old songs (slightly modified). 

Epic Viking Doom Metal influenced by Bathory. After a 2003 demo called "The Awakening", their debut full-length "By Honour" was released by I Hate Records in March 2008. Their second album called "The End" was released in March 2010 by Napalm Records.
