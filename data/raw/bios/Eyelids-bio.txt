EYELIDS have a collective history of creating music for some of the most legendary indie songwriters. These longtime Portland, Oregon collaborators were not only the principal instrumentalists for Robert Pollard's post Guided By Voices band Boston Spaceships for over eight releases, but they have also worked with Stephen Malkmus, The Decemberists, Elliott Smith, Sam Coomes of Quasi, Black Prairie, Jason Lytle of Grandaddy, Loch Lomond, Damien Jurado and Peter Buck (who is producing their upcoming EP this Fall).

Principal songwriters John Moen and Chris Slusarenko have turned inwards to their loves of New Zealand/Flying Nun guitar buzz, their teenage L.A. Paisley Underground obsessions, haunts of early Athens and all things beautiful, lopsided and rock. Along with members Jonathan Drews (guitar), Jim Talstra (bass) and Paulie Pulvirenti (drums) they push and pull against each other's songwriting, in a beautiful tension that just works. Their critically celebrated debut 7” SEAGULLS INTO SUBMISSION got airplay everywhere from BBC Radio to WFMU and was also included in MOJO Magazine's Editors Picks of The Month. This single, as well as the accompanying video, is just a hint of what EYELIDS are all about.

EYELIDS is also the Polish Electronic / Alternative Pop duet, consisting of Dagmara Karolik and Tomasz Drogokupiec. They originate from the industrial city of Katowice in the southern part of Poland.
EYELIDS started writing music in 2016, creating and recording in their home studio in the apartment on the 18th floor of a skyscraper, and released their debut album, "Synesthetic", in September 2018, spawning 6 singles alongside official videos created by Hole Films, including "Porno", "Bloodflower" and their most successful single to date - hopeful ballad "To the Feelings", which was chosen as the 6th most potential song to be the Polish representative in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019. The song has also been a part of many editorial playlists on Spotify, such as Alternatywna Polska or New Music Friday Polska, among others.
In October 2018 EYELIDS became a part of a talent show created by Radio Trójka, the most popular alternative radio station in Poland - Start NaGranie. As of December 2018, they got to the semi-finals and won their episode.
EYELIDS is currently on tour in support of their debut album and working on the sophomore LP.
