Hi peeps! My real name is Antti and i’m an synthwave addict.

I started my first music tryouts with Commodore C64 and poke command. My first real attempts at making music was with my brand new Amiga 500 and ProTracker. I finished my first track ever with my first PC at around 1993-94.  I’ve had few hardware synths at times but

when the Reason 1.0 came out i was sold to software. I’ve tried several DAW’s over the years but i really got stuck into Cockos Reaper few years back.
