Sickmath was established since February 2006, the name was taken from a keyword "stay sick and burn wit us", “Sickmath” itself could be also visualizedas a straight line to show the consistancy of this band in the “death metal” stream .

In August 2007 sickmath began its first split album recording project, but unfortunetly the project was postponed due to the leave of Emput to complete his study in Bandung. Arrangement and lyrics of one of the song "Budak masa kini" in this project could not be completed awaiting the audition search to fill the guitarist position. Finally, in the beginning of 2006 sickmath changed its formation by pulling anom to fill up the vocal and guitar, Yudhi (from “ritual pain”) chopping the bass and Buyung still smashing its drums.

FORMATION 2008 is: ANOM ( VOCKILLS ) NICO SUPERSATAN ( GUITAR ) YUDI ( BASS ) and OCES ( DRUM )  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sickmath">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
