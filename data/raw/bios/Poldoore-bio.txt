Cutting that soul, funk and jazz into atmospheric instrumental hip-hop, Thomas Schillebeeckx is the production stature behind Poldoore. Spending parts of his youth in the US as well as in Belgium, Poldoore quickly found himself making beats. With his ears both in old and new, he carved out his own distinctive, melodic sound. When in his late teens, his productions caught the eye of L.A.-based label Cold Busted, signing him for various releases and two full-on albums.

Poldoore’s first album ‘Street Bangerz Vol. 6: Playhouse’ shot number 1 on the Beatport funk and reggae charts in no less than four days. He followed up consistently with every new release topping the site’s top 10 charts, earning him a loyal and widespread fan base. Poldoore continues to work hard, and with his forthcoming album ‘The Day Off’ scheduled for early 2014 it promises to be a big year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Poldoore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
