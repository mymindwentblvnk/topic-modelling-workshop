Tantara is a Scandinavian Thrash Metal band, mainly from Vestfold, Norway. The band members are born between 1991 and 1992, making the, younger than most bands out there. The band saw its light in September 2009, when drummer Stian, and rhythm guitarist Fredrik decided to bring their 'talent show' project to a new level: Make it officially a band. The two band mates recruited Per as their lead guitarist, which they've played with before. In September 2010, they recruited Stians' old classmate Bjarke as their bassist, making him the first offical bassist in Tantara.

In August 2010, Tantara recorded their first EP, which was released digitally in early October and later on released physically late December the same year.

Soon after the EP was released, the band got in contact with the legendary sound engineer and producer Flemming Rasmussen, and agreed to record Tantaras debut album in July 2011. 

In April 2011, Bjarke decided to leave the band, and Max Warnby from Sk√∂vde, Sweden, decided to join the band full time.

The complete line-up headed over to Copenhagen, Danmark and recorded their debut album in July 2011 with Flemming Rasmussen. The album entitled "Based On Evil" was released in Europe on August 24th, 2012. The band got a lot of great feedback for the album, and they're now focusing on touring and promoting the album as much as possible. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tantara">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
