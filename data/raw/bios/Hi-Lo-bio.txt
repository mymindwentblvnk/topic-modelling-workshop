The alias Hi-Lo is shared by two different artist(s):

1.) Hi-Lo is a side project by dutch DJ/producer Oliver Heldens. His first release under this alias was 'Crank It Up' on Diplo's label Mad Decent.

2.) Hi-Lo is a alternative rock band from Sweden. The music Hi-Lo plays is best described as modern pop/rock. The songs, mostly written by Daniel Thibblin, are built up by achingly beatiful lyrics mixed with meloncholy and powerful but allways melody oriented.
Thibblin's vocals can be described as laid-back and powerful at the same time. Sometimes weaved into the arrangement in a suttle way and other times more at the heart of the song. 
Lead guitarist Erik Lindström's and bassist Victor Björkgren's groundbreak and inovative guitar leads/bassline lifts the songs even further.
All this is backed up by an staggeringlly talented and variated drummer, Felix Waljanson.

The Band has played  several gigs, all of which were recieved very well. The band's plan for the near is to hit the live scene even harder.
