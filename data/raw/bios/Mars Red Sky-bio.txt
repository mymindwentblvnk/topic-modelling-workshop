Mars Red Sky is a French psychedelic rock band formed in 2007 in Bordeaux, France.

The band stoke the fire of a voodoo mass with their 70's old school riffs and their psychedelic groove.

Julien Pras, well known for the pop magnificence of his studio session with Calc, was secretly dreaming of Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin and  was also sharing these musical fantasies with drummer Matgaz and noisy bass player Jimmy Kinast. The three of them make a melodic stoner music using heavy reverbs. Julien Pras's airy voice mixed with the sound of fuzzy electric guitar gives an aerial dimension to their rolling rhythm.

Members:

Julien Pras - guitars, vocals;
Jimmy Kinast - bass guitar, vocals;

Former members:
