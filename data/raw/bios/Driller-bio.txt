DRILLER is a Heavy metal/Hard Rock band from Edinburgh – UK formed in June 2009 by two Brazilian brothers Alex Rech and KK Rech and English bass player Thomas Silk. 
After releasing an EP (Alchemy Of Love) and a Single (Live On), Driller put out their first full length album entitled The Final Deal on September 1st 2013. 

Driller aim to write great songs and reach as many people as possible with them! The Final Deal comes packed with 12 sing-along tunes which combine the best bits of their influences with their own unique style:

Heavy Metal, Hard Rock, Classic Rock, still Melodic and Technical: this is Driller’s powerful music!

Driller’s focus is now to play live as much as possible to spread the word locally in the UK, but as a result of intense online communication with fans, the band is keen to play all over the world!
