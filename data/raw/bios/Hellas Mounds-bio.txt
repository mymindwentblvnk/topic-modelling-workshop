HELLAS MOUNDS, formed in early 2006 and is a sonic flood of sounds, textures, and atmosphere that pulls you under barely letting up for even a moment to gasp for air. Even though they have not been around long they have already made a lasting mark while being compared to Mogwai, Red Sparowes, and Rosetta. 2007 saw the release of "the last ferry to cydonia demo sessions", 2008 saw the release of thier split release with EMPIRES, and 2009 will soon see the re-issue of "the last ferry to cydonia" re-mixed and remastered. out on 1912 records. 2010 saw the release of a new HELLAS MOUNDS ep entitled "NEW HEAVEN/NEW EARTH" 

As of 2011 and beyond HELLAS MOUNDS are on a current break/hiatus
some of the founding memebers of HELLAS MOUNDS have a new project in the works called "RITUALS" (www.facebook.com/ritualsphx)
which have an LP due out March of 2012.
