Jape is the alter-ego of Redneck Manifesto member Richie Egan. Hailing from Crumlin in Dublin, Ireland, he purveys an electronica-heavy music tinged with 'stoner folk'. Jape's most renowned song 'Floating' has been covered by The Raconteurs and The Mighty Stef, to name a few. His debut album 'Cosmosphere' was released in 2003 (Volta Records), followed by 2004's 'The Monkeys In The Zoo Have More Fun Than Me' (Trust Me I'm A Thief). Having recently signed with V2 Records (9th May 2007), a third effort 'Ritual' came out on the 4th June 2008. The single 'Phil Lynott' was pushed forward as a possible Christmas number one in Ireland but barely dent the charts, despite being a huge live favourite. His debut at the SXSW festival in Texas (2007) added much hype and excitement to the future prospects of Jape's career. In December 2008 Jape wrote a song with David Kitt for a Christmas compilation called 'An Indiecater Christmas' which was put out by Indiecater Records. 'Ritual' recently won the 2008 Choice Music Award. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jape">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
