Chronobot is space doom from Canada

Waves of Fuzz, heavily phase-shifted. Delay on everything

5 guys on a quest for cosmic sound, outside of traditional song structure, bending riff and reefer to our uses.

Darius - Space FX and Harmonic guitars (Stoon)
Dafe - Fuzz guitar riff raff and cosmic chants (Regina)
Dan - Low Frequency Bass Vibrations (Winnipeg)
Cody - Battery (Prince Albert)
Tony - 6-String Megalith (Prince Albert)
