Evils Desire is a band founded by the members of violent queen in 2005. It was considered a project until leadsinger Daphne Gobius du Sart and keyboard player Johan Seinen joined the band. The attention then shifted completely to Evils Desire.

Why this change? Lately the music of violent queen changed, new songs didn`t fit the older ones. Evils Desire is darker and more powerful than Violent Queen. The music is a mix of gothic- symphonic- and doommetal. Still the style is hard to describe.

In 2005 Evils Desire had their first live performance. In 2007 the first try- outs in the new formation took place. Shortly after that, a first demo was recorded with 2 new songs, which you can hear on myspace and download from our website www.evilsdesire.com. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Evil%27s+Desire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
