Blood Spencer is a five-piece melodic metal/death-core Band from Muenster Germany, formed in late 2006.
They combine melodic death metal with intense breakdowns.

Their awesome Liveshow spread the word around pretty fast and shortly they began to tour with a lot of familiar bands, always pushing theirselves to the next level.

In 2006 they started as a quartett (Vocals: Matthias "Maze" Held, Guitar: Tristan Hachmeister, Drums: Thomas Bauer, Bass: Sebastian Stening). In fall 2007 they picked up Timo Lohmann as a second guitarist, who, due to personal reasons, left the band early 2008. As a replacement Thomas Germer (Ex-Willschrey) joined the band.

In 2006 they released their first Demo "Face Off" (Sold Out)!
Six months later they came up with their second Demo "...the distance remains" (Sold Out)!
They are currently releasing their first EP called "Our Prophecy Resides". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blood+Spencer">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
