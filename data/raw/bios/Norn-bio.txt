There are various projects called Norn: 
1) Icelandic Punk.

2) The melancholic ambient of Norn - a project that features Distel's Peter Johan NÃ¿land - recounts lingering dreams of fog-ridden landscapes, desolate, monumental cities and sweltering slumber hours in the afternoon heat. 
The debut as Norn is presented as a beautiful 7" sleeve-sized booklet designed by the talented Astrid Florentinus, the artwork of Usotsuki consists of a set of designs, each inspired by one of the 9 tracks. A definite highlight on this disc is the ominous "Balor", which includes a poetic contribution by Pete Simonelli - vocalist of noise rock group Enablers.
Usotsuki is released on Moving Furniture Records.
