Sil Veth is a black/death metal band from Phildelphia that was formed in 1999. In 2007 their first release, The Elemental, was released. The band’s name is a hybrid of two roots that can be found in hundreds of words throughout most Slavic languages. While the direct translation may never be known, roughly these two roots probably stand for “Power” and “Concord.”
