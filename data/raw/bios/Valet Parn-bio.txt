Valet Parn is a metal band formed in Athens, Greece in 2006 by George Emmanuel (Guitars) and Stathis Ridis (Bass). The vocalist Steve Venardo, drummer George Canavari and guitarist Jimmy Haursen joined the band a few months later filling the missing pieces of this musical puzzle.

After spending several months in the rehearsal room, Valet Parn entered Devasoundz Studios on April 2009 in order to record their debut album "Riddle Figure" with Fotis Benardo (SepticFlesh) as co-producer. The mixing and mastering of the album took place at Fredman Studios (In Flames, Dimmu Borgir, Opeth, Arch Enemy) on November 2009 with Fredrick Nordstrom and Henrick Udd behind the mixing desk.

Unfortunately, at the fall of 2010 the band had to split ways with George Canavari (Drums) due to personal reasons, but it didn't take much time till the drummers throne filled by a new talented musician named Socratis Panagouleas. 

The release of the selfâ€“financed debut album "Riddle Figure" came on 31 January 2011. Soundforge Music Group did the official distribution of the album in Greece. The album was also released worldwide digital and analog via CDBaby, iTunes, Amazon and more.

Currently Valet Parn are working on "Riddle Figure's" promotion, spreading their name throughout internet and live shows. On May 2011 Valet Parn will begin their european tour from Durbuy Rock Festival (Triptykon, SepticFlesh, The Haunted and more) in Belgium and then supporting SepticFlesh on their French tour for almost a month. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/valet+parn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
