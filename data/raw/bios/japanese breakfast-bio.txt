Japanese Breakfast is the solo musical project of Korean-American musician Michelle Zauner (of Little Girl, Big Spoon, Post Post, Little Big League). 

Zauner released a tape in June 2013 under the solo moniker Japanese Breakfast. The tape was titled June and boasted thirty tracks written and recorded every day of the month. A stark deviation from Little Big League's guitar-based indie rock, it showcased Zauner's dark lyrics, unique vocals and inherent knack for pop melody.

Two bedroom pop cassettes later, Japanese Breakfast returns with a first full-fledged LP and vinyl release, Psychopomp. The album explores Zauner's experimental interests and hosts a wide range of sound: jarring anime samples, minimalist ballads, rhythms and synths reminiscent of Tango in the Night-era Fleetwood Mac paired with the moody intimacy of Mount Eerie. Psychopomp revisits and revamps lo-fi tracks and adds chilling new songs to fall in love with. 

In 2019, Japanese Breakfast released two singles under the W Hotels music label, "Essentially" and a cover of the Tears for Fears song, Head Over Heels.

In 2021, Zauner returns, having released three singles to her upcoming album, Jubilee, which will be out on the 4th of June. The singles are Be Sweet, Posing in Bondage, and Savage Good Boy; they were released in this order. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Japanese+Breakfast">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
