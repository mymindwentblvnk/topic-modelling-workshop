Airut was a heavy metal band from Finland sung in Finnish. They incorporate some influences from Finnish folklore and also some influences from thrash and death metal. One of the biggest reasons why they are known is the mod for Operation Flashpoint called Finnish Defense Forces, as they use it as their soundtrack.
