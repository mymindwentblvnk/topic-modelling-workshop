Sofia Rotaru (София Ротару) is a Soviet/Ukrainian singer from an ethnic Romanian family. She was born in Marshinci, region of Chernivtsi, Ukraine on August 7, 1947. She has sung songs in Russian, Ukrainian and Moldavian languages, which were equally popular throughout the Soviet Union.

Her songs have become the classics of the Soviet and post-Soviet stages. Sofia was cast in seven musical films, her debut being in 1971 in "Червона рута" (Red rue). She played the main roles in films "Где ты, любовь?" (Where are you, love?, 1980) and "Душа" (Soul, 1981). She has performed in concerts in the United States, Asia, Europe, Australia. Sofia has got dozen of prizes, awards and medals.

In 1986, she was the first female pop singer to be given the prestigious title of "People's Artist of USSR". President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma and President of Russia Vladimir Putin gave awards to Sofia Rotaru in August 2002 (for her 55th birthday), bestowing upon her the high rank of the Hero of Ukraine for her "outstanding personal merits in the sphere of art", and the Russian order "For merits before the Nation", respectively.

While Mrs. Rotaru commonly goes by this last name, her official last name is Yevdokymenko-Rotaru. Yevdokymenko was the last name of her late husband. Following several months of mourning, Rotaru resumed her feverish concert and recording activity and again topped the Russian and Ukrainian charts. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sofia+Rotaru">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
