Psychotropic Transcendental is a polish band, playing a hard to categorise music, being a strange mixture of rock, metal and trance. After some time a label of narcotic porno metal was stuck to them.
The band itself describe their music as "exploring humid forests of brain cells drowned in tetrahydroxycanabinol and posthumous, orgasmatic dopamine". The lyrics are in Var-Inath, a language, that brings germanic atmosphere, spiced up with slavonic accent.

Band members are also involved in other projects: Brain Story, Via Alia, Unipolar Manic Depressive Psychosis, Blindead, StrommoussHeld, C.h.District. As of 2007 Kumala (g) became full time member of Closterkeller.

So far (early 2008), they have released only one album "Ax libereld..." in 2002.
