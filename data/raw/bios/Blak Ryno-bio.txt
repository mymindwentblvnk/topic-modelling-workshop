Blak Ryno a.k.a "Ryno Di Stinger" is a dancehall reggae artist, and former member of Portmore Empire.
In 2010 Ryno officially left the Empire and has since come under fire as a traitor. It is rumored that he left after Vybz Kartel (the leader of the Empire) was found to be purposely holding his carrer back and organiz physical attacks on Empire members that were found to be unruly. Rynohas made several answer back songs explaining his side of the dispute.
Since his departure several other members have also left the Empire or spoken out on Vybz Kartel's deliberate holding back of their rise to stardom. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blak+Ryno">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
