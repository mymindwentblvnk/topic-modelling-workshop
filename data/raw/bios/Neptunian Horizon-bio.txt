Charlottesville, Virginia (2011-present)

Neptunian Horizon is a studio solo project by Thomas Minderle, the fringe conspiracy author known as Montalk. 

Themes of gnosticism, spirituality, and conspiracies are channeled through a blend of symphonic, power, and epic doom metal. Vocals are clean with occasional use of vocoders. Compositions aim to be epic, otherworldly, transcendental, heavy, and melodic; to evoke an unplaceable sense of familiarity yet strangeness. 

Thomas Minderle was born in Germany in 1980. He conceived Neptunian Horizon and recorded the debut album "Descent" in Charlottesville, Virginia (USA). The album was self-released on October 10, 2011. The name "Neptunian Horizon" signifies the boundary between waking and dreaming, conscious and subconscious, higher and lower realms.
