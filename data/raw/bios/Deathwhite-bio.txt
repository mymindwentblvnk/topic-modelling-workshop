Formed in 2012, DEATHWHITE were created in part to follow in the path created by dark metal torchbearers such as KATATONIA, MY DYING BRIDE, PARADISE LOST, and ANATHEMA.

The band's earliest work gave rise to their impactful blend of heavy, melodic, and deeply emotional metal. DEATHWHITE's profile grew significantly with the late 2015 release of their 'Solitary Martyr' EP, which was hailed by critics as "...spun gold, thick with emotion..." and "wonderfully engrossing."

DEATHWHITE spent 2016 writing and recording their first full-length album 'For a Black Tomorrow'. 'For a Black Tomorrow' is scheduled for international release through Season of Mist in early 2018.
