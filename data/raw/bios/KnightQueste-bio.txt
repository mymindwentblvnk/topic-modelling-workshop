Forging a path in the Australian metal scene, KnightQueste (formed 2008) have plans to conquer the world with their take on power metal. The pounding rhythm section of Simon Batley and Sean Falconer thumps away accompanied by lead guitar finesse by Matt Bell and the Rhapsody inspired keyboard of Gareth Hoyle. Cahn Turner fronts the band with his operatic tenor vocals that bring together the five elements of KnightQueste into a finely wrought weapon cutting through the subpar bands that swamp Australian music.

KnightQueste have performed with a number of great Australian bands including LORD, Aeon of Horus, Rituals of the Oak and Rampage and as of December 2010, have released a self-produced four track demo that can be downloaded for free from the above link.

Charging onwards into 2011, KnightQueste continue to write and forge new music with the aim of completing a full length release somewhere in the near future!
