Lush and melodic, seductive and experimental, organic and alternative... Tangents is not what you may expect from a duo containing Derek Kerswill (Unearth/Seemless), but it is the strengths of singer/guitarist Dave Witham (Flat 12/Of The Hour) that makes this project soar in the vein of Jeff Buckley, As Tall As Lions, or even Radiohead. Witham's magnificent voice rises over the spiraling sonic backdrop with dazzling control and splendor. Ambitious songwriting creates the catchiest music either musician has released to date, and is sure to turn some heads when the album is released early next year. - Dan Goldin - Exploding In Sound
