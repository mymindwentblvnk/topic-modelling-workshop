There are several bands called Grimnir.
There is an Austrian black metal band and a German pagan/black metal band and some others.
The German Grimnir were formed in 2005 and play a mixture of traditional black metal and more melodic viking/pagan metal melodies.
The band consists of four band members and is definitely unpolitical. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grimnir">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
