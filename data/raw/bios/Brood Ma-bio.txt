"Brood Ma is the musical alias of artist James B Stringer. Brood Ma is a fractured, cybergothic nexus of tropes from weird literature, dystopian rave and high technology, presented in longform performances and recordings that resemble crisis scenarios as much as electronic mixes. The music tends to be oppressively psychedelic, evoking fourth-world entropy, embattled tax-havens, and the aesthetics of simulated combat. His record F I S S I O N is available from Mantle records, and his forthcoming records will be released on Quantum Natives." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brood+Ma">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
