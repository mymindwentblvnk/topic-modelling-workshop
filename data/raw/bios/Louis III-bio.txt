Hailing from Croydon, South London, singer-songwriter Louis III has already begun to garner support from heavy hitters like BBC’s Radio1, 1Xtra, i-D, Wonderland, and High Snobiety, carving out a reputation for his candid, beat driven pop/R&B sound.

Drawing influence from the culture clash of sounds he grew up around - think classic songwriters Bob Marley & The Wailers, Leonard Cohen, Tracy Chapman via current artists like Major Lazer, Jai Paul, Kanye West, Usher - this past year has seen Louis’ tracks featured as ‘Best New Pop’ on BBC Radio 1, as well as Spotify playlist adds to 'Soultronic, ‘Chillmatic’, and 'R&B UK’ amongst others. Louis recently lent his pen and vocals to UK dance-duo Sigma's hit track ‘Anywhere’, racking up over 50 million streams on Spotify to date, whilst his recent collaboration with Austrian wunderkind producer filous has amassed over 3 million streams.

Louis was recently hand picked by Virgil Abloh - Louis Vuitton’s creative director, and Kanye West’s right hand man - to walk in the Louis Vuitton SS20 Men’s show at Paris Fashion week alongside artists including Octavian and Dev Hynes.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Louis+III">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
