Raised to the Ground began in December 2008 when 3 members of former band “Reaper” invited Conan Heffernan (vocalist, guitarist) into the band. The members decided on the name as a play on the phrase “Razed to the Ground” and like the idea of using an oxymoron (two contradictory terms in this case Raised and Ground).

The band started writing and played their first few shows with fairly established names on the Irish metal circuit. From an early demo the band got offered distribution in the UK for whatever they may release in the near future by indie label “Death Cap Records”. Due to this the band then decided to head to the studio to record an E.P and instead of following the trend of most local bands, which was recording themselves or on the cheap, the band decided to go for a more professional approach and splash out on the project. With 4 plus tracks written, the group picked their favourite 4 and headed down to Data Recording Studios, Co. Kerry for four days of recording. After the tracks were recorded and mixed by the in-house engineer, the band sent the tracks off to Tower Studio, France to get them mastered. 
In the meantime the band have been playing alot of gigs on the Irish circuit but feeling frustrated by the lack of a scene in Ireland, the band decided to organise a 6 date tour of the UK with Manchester based band “Ravenface”  whom they met through Death Cap. This tour is in the middle of being finalised and is scheduled for mid-August. *This tour has since been postponed but the band will continue to gig in Ireland and will soon be venturing overseas.

With the D.I.Y release of the E.P the band has received various radio airplay offers as well as awaiting reviews from Metal Hammer and Kerrang magazine.
