1. Fredrik, a songwriter/sound mangler/concept artist three-piece from southern part of Sweden, embodies some of the most iconic Scandinavian experimental pop aesthetics: captivating melodies, rich layered arrangements and complicated charming instrumentation somewhat in the vein of Sigur Ros and Efterklang, but essentially in the language of trees. Without overloading the compositions, Fredrik builds layer upon layer of atmospheric, melodically overpowering and somewhat mystical soundscapes.
