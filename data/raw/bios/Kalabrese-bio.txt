Kalabrese is one of the more glittering characters in Zurichs nightmusic-scene and and mingles since a couple of years in the frontline, as jockey, producer, promoter and as club owner. Through his very own style as a producer he caused a stir outside of switzerland too and through his release on the well-known Perlon label he gained attention by many. The feedback on "Hühnerfest" the follow-up of "Chicken Fried Rice" became even better. DJs like Laurent Garnier, Luke Solomon and Rainer Trüby didn't stop spinning this true disco-funk-stomper that was produced together with a brass orchestra. SAchas Debut Album "Rumpelzirkus"is a great piece of music, made for the morning after and after everything. It’s an album like the sunrise after a long night out in the clubs. It rumbles and works the funk organically and songorientated. Kalabreses Rumpelzirkus (rumbling circus) goes on tour after album release with a band setup. check www.philipsherburn.com: great Album-Review-Blog.
