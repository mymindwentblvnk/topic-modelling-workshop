Cadaver Mutilator and Cadaver Mutilator are twin bands. They are called the same and come from the same city. Their story was once only one, but it bifurcated after the recording of Carnasyum album (on the other CM page). Three of the members (Paride Mercurio, Rosario Piazza and Marcello Triolo) released the album and the other two members kept with the same name and style, recruited new members and began composing to record a new album. So, effectively, there are two Cadaver Mutilator bands.

The band is now named Humator to avoid confusion, and they consider the releases shown here as Humator releases. However, as they were originally released under the Cadaver Mutilator name, they shall remain listed here.
