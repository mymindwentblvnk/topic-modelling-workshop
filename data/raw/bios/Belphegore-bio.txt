harsh noise project started in 2012 by a young musician who currently lives in Tennesse (USA). In fact he started two musical projects with a similar style: VICTIM´S EYE and BELPHEGORE, and sine then he has already recorded thirteen works on mp3 format and two CD´s in 2014. Meanwhile VICTIMS FAMILY is a classic fast and agressive harsh noise, BELPHEGORE has run slowier and has some ambient / drone influences.
