“Scandinavian Death Metal at it’s finest, and certainly one of the best and most mature death metal bands to come out of Denmark for a long time”

While often being compared to Amon Amarth and Behemoth by reviewers, By the Patient is taking a new approach on the Scandinavian metal sound by not limiting to specific genres. They incorporate catchy tunes, grooves, and have found the perfect balance between melody and intensity.

Having played legendary festivals such as Copenhell, Wacken and Roskilde, as well as supporting bands like Aborted and Toxic Holocaust, By the Patient is a competent and well rehearsed live act.

The third album, due out in 2014, sees the band exploring new musical approaches as well as perfecting their craft.
