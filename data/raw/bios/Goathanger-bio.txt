Goathanger are a powerful five piece metal band hailing from Whyalla South Australia, originating raw & catchy songs that have a driving groove. They offer a solid selection of songs that focus on producing a live performance to capture the listener's deliberation.

Originally without a jam room, Goathanger began writing songs specifically on guitars. None of which made it to the final setlist's. But the true Goathanger sound would not evolve until the band began writing together as a whole unit. Songs started to flow and over the following six months, eight solid tunes were created. Bass player Scott Hockey soon joined the band and began adding a new dimension to the sound with his grooving bass lines.

Goathanger's debut gig was at Norths Football Club Whyalla, with fellow local metal band Warclaw and Adelaide's Quaero Verum on June 12th 2011. Since then, further shows in Adelaide, Port Lincoln and Whyalla have been gathering the band some recognition and a solid fan base.

Their five track demo EP titled "DEMO:lition" was released May 12th and is now available for free download. Track one "Man On Fire" from the demo has recently been added to the compilation album Kill City Volume 38 in L.A by 272 Records, as well as track two "Emma You Bloated" on Australia's Ear Bleeders Volume 4. National and international radio plays and reviews have been accumulating in the recent weeks, including Nuclear Fallout Radio in the U.S adding all tracks to their rotation.

Goathanger aim to be in the studio late this year to record a full length album with Andy Kite at Against The Grain Studio's in Adelaide, so stay tuned!
