A fresh sound but at the same time with classic touches, catchy and danceable compositions but at the same time full of feeling... Oscar Anton is one of those new names that you won't stop hearing on the international scene.

Despite having a long relationship with music, the young French artist has recently come to fame with one of those tracks, which suddenly, are played in a loop on social networks: 'nuits d'et√©' has catapulted Anton to the top. But in this case he was not alone, on his musical compositions, his voice is mixed with that of his little sister Clementine, who accompanies him on numerous tracks.

The most sentimental lyrics are heard over a sound base full of layers and instruments that give each of his songs that musicality so characteristic of this young artist, who after years of career can finally devote himself to what he loves most.

A small studio in his parents' house where he spent hours and hours during the pandemic, this has been the place where he has found all the necessary inspiration for each of the songs he has been releasing over the last year, which already have millions of reproductions. 

His recent success has brought him closer to big names such as Bob Sinclar, the famous DJ and producer of tracks like 'World Hold On', who approached the young man to remix his song 'bye bye'.

His growing recognition is giving him the opportunity to start playing on big stages such as the Montreux Jazz Festival (Switzerland), one of the most important in this country, where he will be playing this summer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oscar+Anton">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
