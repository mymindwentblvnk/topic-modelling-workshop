Lanewin is a symphonic metal band from Saint-Petersburg, Russia which uses melodic instrumentals, synthesizers, orchestral arrangements and distorted guitars with female vocals. The lyrics are concerned with human existence, emotion, and mental states. 

Lanewin was assembled in October 2007 and a month later gave their first performance at Port club. After that the band continued playing gigs at famous stages in their city. Initially covering Nightwish and Epica, the band started composing songs of their own and recorded the single "Essence of War", which was well received. 

In winter 2009 the band announced that they would begin recording an album; Autuua, the debut album, was released in February of 2010. Even before the release, the band was overfilled with questions about the meaning of the word 'Autuua'. This word was used in an ancient Diavian dialect, but due to lack of written sources the exact meaning was lost. The closest description of the word is when you stand on a bank of a lake, drop a pebble into pond and watch ripples spread out.  

Lanewin was disbanded on 9th September 2013, the members formed a new band which they called ElisaDay.
