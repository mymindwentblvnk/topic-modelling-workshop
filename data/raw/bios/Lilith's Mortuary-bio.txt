Born in the summer of 2004. The Lilith's Mortuary project was meant to be a band that sounded like no other band we have ever heard. At first, the band was build on a Goth-Black basis and it had a very diferent lineup that the one it has nowdays. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lilith%27s+Mortuary">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
