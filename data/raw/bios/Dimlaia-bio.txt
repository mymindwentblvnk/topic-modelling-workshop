Dimlaia formed in 1998 in Memphis, Tennessee before relocating to Oakland, California. Their sound is a unique take on the traditional crust band, blending sludge and dark hardcore accompanied by Violin and Cello. Dimlaia created a sonically dark and dramatic sound-scape compositions drenched with soothing melodies and grey atmospherics. 

For having member Carl Auge (previously of His Hero is Gone) on bass and vocals, guest Cellist  Jackie Perez Gratz (Amber Asylum) and being recorded and mixed by Dave Edwardson (Neurosis) the band was relatively unknown during it existence.
