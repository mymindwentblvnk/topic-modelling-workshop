BLISS OF FLESH was born in 1999 in the North of France (Calais) with Sikkardinal (guitars) and Fleshstigma (Drums). A few months later, J.Poizon (bass),  and Insane (guitars)  joined the band. They aim at expressing their hate and disgust by the way of an intense Black Death metal, without any pressure of style. The only key words are Destruction and Despair.

    In 2000, Terrorizt (ex-Merrimack, Ancestral Fog) devoted his flesh to the band and vomited his insane lyrics during six years. With this line up, they recorded a rehearsal tape « Prelude to Bestial Annihilation » in 2000, a pro-tape recorded at the Midnight Studio « Lethal Ceremomies » on Akedia Rekordz (2002),  a split Ep with BLOODHAMMER on Primitive Reaction (2004), and the Ep « Todtentanz » on Meurtre Noir / Shades of Death (2005).

    Each time, the criticisms were ecstatic and the band forged his live experience sharing stages with bands as ENTHRONED, VADER, SHINING, SECRETS OF THE MOON, ANTAEUS, etc… during many gigs in Europe.

    In 2006, Terrorizt  goes and Necurat (ex-LATRODECTUS) comes to spread his imprecations. Insane leaves also for health reasons and the band decides to use live session guitarists. In 2007, BLISS OF FLESH releases a split Ep with Annihilation on W.T.C.  The band is now stronger than ever and after having paid their tribute to the underground, they decide to record their first full length album. 

     In 2008, they sign on the German label Twilight Vertrieb Records (WALLACHIA, DARKENED NOCTURN SLAUGHTERCULT, THE MONOLITH DEATHCULT, KOLDBRANN, etc…) and release their debut album « Emaciated Deity ». It is hailed as one of the best black death metal album of the year in European reviewz as Hard Rock, Rock Hard, Metallian and webzines. Taking advantage of this success, the gigs go on in Europe.

     In 2010, after several live sessions, Pandemic (guitars) definitely joins the band and together, they destroy European stages during the UNHOLY DOGMA TOUR (with GORATH and HYSTERIA). The band also shoots the music video “Emaciated Deity” (Cf below) which will be rewarded as one of the best extreme music video of the year.

      In 2011, the band goes on spreading hate on stage with LOUDBLAST, TAAKE, DESTINITY, etc… 

      In 2012, They record their new album “Beati Pauperes Spiritu” and master it at Midnight Studio (ARKHON INFAUSTUS, PHAZM, etc…).. The artwork is made by Nagash (MAYHEM, CADAVERES, …). The EXPIATION TOUR  2012 is launched...
