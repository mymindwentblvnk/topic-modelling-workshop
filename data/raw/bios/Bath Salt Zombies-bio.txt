Bath Salt Zombies was born on a 'trip' and some jokes. What was supposed to be one song, ended as an addiction. The official beginning of the band is on January 10, 2014. Features brothers Jerry Joe, Misael and a handful of collaborations from the local Puerto Rico hardcore, punk and metal scene such as Joen Blanco (Tav√∫, Oshurun) and Antonio Caraballo (Yeva, session work).   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bath+Salt+Zombies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
