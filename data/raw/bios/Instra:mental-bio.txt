Few artists have had such an immediate impact on drum and bass in recent years as Instra:mental, the highly acclaimed duo of Boddika and Jon Convex. Since their early releases on Soul:r and Darkestral, the pair have been steadily building momentum with a number of influential singles across labels such Exit and Naked Lunch and developing a diverse and unique sound that crosses a range of styles and tempos. Instra:mental have so far forged successful studio partnerships with the likes of Jonny L, Skream, Burial and most notably dBridge, with whom they have hosted the Autonomic podcast series. 

Nominated for "Best Breakthrough Producers" in DJ Magazine's Best of British awards in 2009, this accolade only tells half the story. The duo has seen the launch of their label NonPlus+, the start of residencies for Fabric and Rinse FM and a whole host of international appearances including festivals in Croatia and Sardinia plus a tour of Japan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Instra:mental">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
