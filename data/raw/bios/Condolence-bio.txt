There is more than one artist with this name.

1) Condolence was a Doom/Death Metal band from Bodegraven, Netherlands. Formed in 1990, they only released a demo in September of the same year, titled "Pernicious Segregation".

2) Started as a project of the members of the grindcore band Emetica back in 2001, Condolence tried to experince the possibility of combining noise, grindcore and some dark melodies.bThe emphasis was placed on unique noisy sound, providing a different atmosphere and production for each song. Of course, this noise is far from any production, but the attempt was to avoid too much similarity between the songs. The lyrics create a very somber mood contemplating on the themes of death experiences. Demo "Myself Flung Down the Precipice of Being" was recorded between 2001 and 2002. and then the band completely stopped creating noise.
The music found its way through to some individuals by some obscure channels. Yet, Condolence will continue to terrorize the music scene by some new melodies, which are about to appear in the future. As for the influences, there weren't any at the time, except for some grindcore bands. These days I could try to describe Condolence as a band which might resemble to such acts as Gore Beyond Necropsy, Sopor Aeternus, and John Zorn, though very far from quallity of these bands in any way.
An iterview with Condolence can be found in Helly Cherry webzin, number 54 February 2007.
