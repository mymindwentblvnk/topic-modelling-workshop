They released their first EP, "But Is It Even Music, Really?" in 2016, and have been compared to Mission of Burma, Devo, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, The Vibrators, Dead Kennedys, and "something Danzig might've thrown up after pumping weights with The Governator in a futuristic wasteland.‚Äù (Empty Bottle Presents)
