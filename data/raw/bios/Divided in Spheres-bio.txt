Divided In Spheres are an unsigned Melodic Death Metal band from Germany who formed in 2005. They self-released the 'Illusion Ends' EP in 2010.



In 2005, DIVIDED IN SPHERES was founded under the name Metal Wrath as a pure melodic death metal band from Düren (Germany).

After a few lineup changes, gigs, and a natural desire to construct new songs, the band sought to progress in a way that distinguished them from the typical genre standard. These fresh ideas inspired them to seek professional recording.

The band got in contact with producer Mario Dahmen (The Anti Doctrine, Bughole, 10 FOLD B-LOW.), who brought new energy and helped them to achieve their purpose. Thus, at the end of 2009, the EP “ILLUSION ENDS” was produced by LIQUID AETHER Audio, and mastered by Marko Schneider from SKYWALK Records (RAGE, BLIND GUARDIAN).

During the production it became apparent that the name METAL WRATH didn’t fit their new style. The band decided to choose a new name- “DIVIDED IN SPHERES”, to suit the innovative new sound they produced.

After a few concerts in 2009 at local venues and abroad, Divided in Spheres look into a bright future.
