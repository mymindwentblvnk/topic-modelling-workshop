Holier Than Thou? formed in May of 1999. Jeff (guitar) & Noel (drums) were jamming on some song ideas influenced by a variety of '80s hardcore bands. d.r. & Jeff were roomates and spent way too much time complaining to one another about the lameness of the scene at that time & waxing nostalgic about the glory days of their youth (mid '80s), and so Jeff asked d.r. to be the vocalist for his new project with Noel needing a bass player. Noel coyly approached his 11th grade Math teacher, whom he knew to be a fossilized closet-punk from the Cretaceous Period, and inquired, "Hey, Mr. Sheffeild... what're you doin' tonight?"... this, of course, scared the fecal matter right out of Kevin's large intestine (colon), and so he tentatively interrogated, "Whyyyyy?," to which Noel nefariously blurted out,"Wanna play some rockin' jams?"... and the rest is history. And i do mean "history". Holier Than Thou? finally called it quits in June of 2005, after more than 6 years of lagging, flailing, and generally creating a bad name for themselves ("Assholier Than Thou?" was one suggestion... this can be blamed largely on the addition of Graham on guitar in the Spring of 2003) It was agreed by all that this was the right time to end the mudslide, having somehow manged to tour the U.S. and Europe (twice) and to release a fair amount of music while being only semi-conscious the entire time. Miraculously, they have all remained friends after countless dramas both at home and on tour (mostly d.r.'s fault).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Holier+Than+Thou%3F">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
