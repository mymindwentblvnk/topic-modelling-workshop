Redshape is a pseudonym of Sebastian Kramer (b. East Germany), whose sound is hard to describe, sitting somewhere between everything in dance music and his own imagination. It's not minimal, not maximal, and always historically respecting the vibe of Detroit.

Redshape endeavours to avoid repetition - So, his live shows (which have brought him to nearly every known European club), morph and develop each time, to never play the same show a second time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Redshape">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
