Delchia started as a drone, ambient, melodic noise project inspired by psychedelic vision of physics science formed in 2007 Vilnius, Lithuania. 

Delchia is a group of paranormal sound creators who have chosen a unique and complicated road extremely remote from the standards of rock and roll. The act can be described through three concepts: minimal arrangements, droning guitar background and psychedelic bass lines. Musical explorations of Nikas D., a well known personality in the Lithuanian underground, started with guitar ambient and gradually developed embracing elements of tribal, drone and doom. Delchiaâ€™s tracks are based on psychedelic science images - from elementary particles to galaxy clusters.

Delchia made its stage debut in the festival Night of the Living Doom in 2008, and released its first CDR Termodinamika in 2009. A number of works included in the experimental, drone and doom compilation Droning Earth Vol.26 and Droning Earth Vol.28.

The original lineup:

Nikas D. - guitar, bass guitar;
+ very talented live members.
