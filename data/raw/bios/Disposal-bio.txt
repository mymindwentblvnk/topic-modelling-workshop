There are multiple bands with the name "Disposal".

1. Disposal is a crust punk band from Pathum Thani, Bangkok, Thailand, formed in 2018.

2. Disposal is a Portuguese band from Lisbon, formed in the Spring of 2012.

Cenoura (Drums) and Mike (Guitar) used to jam in their basement and decided to start a real project so they added Luís (Bass) to the band. The band started to define their genre. Throughout the times the band wrote songs but still, a vocalist was needed so J'António (ex-vocals) joined the band. The recording sessions started. Later J'António left the band because he realized his place wasn't as vocalist. The band was also in the need of a second guitar player so Giga filled the gap. Filipe (Vocals) joined as well so DISPOSAL is now a project ready to move forward. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Disposal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
