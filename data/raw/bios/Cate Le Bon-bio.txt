Cate Le Bon (born Cate Timothy on 4 March 1983) is a Welsh singer-songwriter, now based in Los Angeles. She sings in both English and Welsh. She has released four solo albums, three EPs and a number of singles. Le Bon is also known for her collaborations with among others Manic Street Preachers, Neon Neon, and Matt Davies.

Le Bon is singled out by critics for her "beautiful, haunting voice". She described writing and performing music as "important to me, it's just an expression and sometimes it's not necessary to moralise it". Le Bon claimed that "early experiences with a string of pet deaths had a profound lasting effect on me" and informed her initial self-admitted "abnormal fixation with death". She describes her lyric writing as "foraging for [the right] words and then everything falls into place". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cate+le+Bon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
