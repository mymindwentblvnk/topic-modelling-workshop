Thrash metal band from Slovenija. The band was formed in the 2002 by the Robert C. (Vocals and Guitars) and Robert L.(Drums). Shortly after that, Sašo B. (bass guitar) and Emanuel K. (Pici, lead guitar) joined them, and the group became alive. After a year or so band line-up was changed. After Sašo B. and Emanuel K. left, Daniel D. on bass guitar and Matej C. on lead guitar and back vocals joined the line–up. In that time, some radical changes in the music kind have happened. The rhythms of hard rock where exchanged with heavier and heavier sounds of metal music. After the first ten songs came into existence, band recorded their first demo with 10 tracks under the name Thunder – Storm. They have also released second demo called Not the Same, including 8 tracks. The second demo is even heavier, harder and faster than the first one.
