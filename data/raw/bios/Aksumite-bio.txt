Primitive, lo-fi, raw black metal punk.  Unlike many false "punk black metal bands" Aksumite draws heavily from first wave BM and filters them through a uniquely hardcore punk lens.  The result is a 14 minute romp through various incarnations of metal and hardcore punk tied bound together in bundles of anxious energy.

The album "The Gleam of Wetted Lips" (CSR001), released in 2011, was the first release on the new black metal/noise/extreme cassette label Colloquial Sound Recordings based in Grand Rapids, MI â€” it can be purchased at colloquialsoundrecordings.bigcartel.com/

Aksumite consists of two members who each have solo projects also appearing on Colloquial Sound Recordings, A Pregnant Light and Obliti Devoravit <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aksumite">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
