In late 2012, Lansing Michigan power trio Infectonator was formed by members currently or previously active in Sauron, Borrowed Time, Dark Psychosis, Ghost Tower and Mysophilia. The first self-produced recording, 'Brainfuckers,' was released in March 2013. Initial feedback has seen comparisons to Sadus, Hellwitch, Recalcitrance, Nasty Savage (though the vox are harsh), and Coroner. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Infectonator">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
