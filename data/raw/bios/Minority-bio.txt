Minority is a “heavy” band based out of the Los Angeles area in the suburbs of Downey, California. The group consists of Drummer Xavier Garcia, Guitarist Jesse “Mr. Portillo” Portillo, and Bassist/Vocalist Matthew Martinez. During the fall of 2019, the band released their first single entitled “Dread”, followed by the raw in your face styled “Clueless Manikins - EP” in spring of 2020, giving fans a retrospective look into the early days of the band. With the pandemic putting a halt on the entire world, the band took the opportunity to head into the studio to record a follow up. Fueled by frustration with the current state of music, the band makes a statement with “Enemies To The Heir - EP”, capturing a cathartic representation of the band’s take no prisoners mentality. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Minority">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
