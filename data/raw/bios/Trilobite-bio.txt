1)Trilobite is an experimental indie folk band from New Mexico.  The band consists of Jason Aspeslet {percussion} Michelle Collins {vox, Th, keys} Mark Ray Lewis {vocal, guitar} Darrell Sparks {bass, harmony}.  MARK RAY LEWIS was raised on Highway 61 across from the Huck Finn Shopping Center in Hannibal MO, and in his 20's he was working as a landscaper in New Mexico when Stanford U. offered him a monthly stipend to do nothing but sit around and write fiction, BUT soon enough, he returned to Albuquerque and fell in with a dark cabal of hopped up musicians including: JASON ASPESLET a rhythm-smith who started playing perididdles in the 4th grade; MARK WEAVER, the city's Go-to Low-brass man; DARRELL SPARKS a muli-instrumentalist who grew up among Volk Music royalty in West Texas (there's speculation that he may have pushed baby Jessica into the well); and MICHELLE COLLINS whose palliative harmonies would be a silver blessing to any writer's song. Trilobite's self-titled first album was released in 2006 and 2nd album "Silver Skin" shall be released this summer.
