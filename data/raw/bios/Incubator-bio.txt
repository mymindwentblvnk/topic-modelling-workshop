Incubator was among the first wave of german death metal bands. founded in 1989 their 1991 debut 'symphonies of spiritial cannibalism' showed a band that offered a unique blend of psychedelic rock and death metal. their then only 17 year old singer stood out with an uncanny ability to move his voice from deep growls to high shreeks. the album caught praise from the press and was the extreme statement of death metal in germany at the time.

their second album 'mcgillroy the houselfy' followed in 92 and is regarded by many as a masterpiece of german death metal. showing a band that had matured in songwriting ability, technical prowess and lust for experimentation the album is masterful cross between king crimson, voivod and morbid angel. again the vocal abilites of singer chris left the critics astonished.

the original band desolved after 'mcgillroy' and the following albums could not keep up to the high standarts of the first two albums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Incubator">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
