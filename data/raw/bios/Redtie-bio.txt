REDTIE is a band from Curitiba, Paraná Brazil with it’s own sound formed at the beginning of 2007 with the musical goal to rescue and update thrash metal, relying on musical elements present in productions during the 80s, together with elements of current productions within the style, intending in this way to create a new conception of the style, different from what has gone before or is currently being produced. Soon REDTIE was presenting a rapid and aggressive sound, with lyrics in English which contemplate such themes as politics, violence, film and history.
Why REDTIE?
During the War of Canudos, in the third invasion against Antonio Conselheiro’s religious fanatics and their rogue settlement at Canudos in the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia, colonel Moreira Morais, at the head of the republican army, enacted a practice of extermination, which counted on  a strong psychological impact. It consisted of public throat-cuttings of armed prisoners. The descriptions of eyewitness  accounts and war correspondence made it clear that things proceeded in the following manner: the executioner positioned himself behind the prisoner, stabbing him in the throat while pulling his head back by the hair, and then inserting two fingers of his left hand in the prisoner’s nostrils he slit the prisoner’s  throat with the large knife in his right hand, causing the blood to flow down from the throat across the front of the body. In English this practice was nicknamed the red tie, having already been used during the federalist revolution, however it only became well known throughout Brazil during the War of Canudos.
