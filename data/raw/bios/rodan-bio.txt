There are four bands called Rodan:

1) Rodan (1992) emerging from the same circle of musicians that spawned Squirrel Bait and Slint, Rodan formed in 1992 out of a failed high school rap project. Guitarists Jason Noble and Jeff Mueller enlisted Tara Jane O’Neil on bass and a couple of drummers before Kevin Coultas came aboard permanently. After a couple of 7”s and self-released cassettes, Quarterstick released the band’s first and only full-length Rusty in 1994. The band broke up at the end of the year, aiding their growing cult following.

Jason went on to form Rachel's, Jeff started June of 44, and Tara began a solo career after recording with Retsin, and The Sonora Pine. Jason and Jeff later reunited in The Shipping News. In summation, Rodan was Quarterstick’s indie rock super group that spawned numerous other intriguing projects, most of which are still putting out records and touring today.

2) Rodan (1974) is an American progressive rock/funk band that released a full-length in 1974.

3) Rodan is a rapper associated with MF DOOM (Daniel Dumile). He released his debut album Theophany: The Book of Elevations on February 4, 2004.

He was one of the original members of KMD and has made guest appearances on several of Daniel Dumile's albums (including Operation: Doomsday, Vaudeville Villain and Take Me to Your Leader) and most recently was featured on many tracks on the Monsta Island Czars debut Escape from Monsta Island! (which also featured MF DOOM).

His name is directly adapted from the fictional Japanese monster Rodan, as are the names of other Monster Island Czars members.
