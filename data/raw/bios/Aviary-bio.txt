Aviary (1970's-) were formed in Seattle back in the mid 70's. Brad Love on keyboards and Toby Bowen on lead guitar were the driving force behind the band. They had modest success in Oregon, releasing the self titled first album to good critical acclaim before moving to L.A where EPIC records hoped to sign them. 
Brian Lane, an agent, moved in quickly and snapped them up from under Epics nose. He convinced them to move to England , his home country, to record their second album with a more 'new romantic' sound. A strange move, considering that their music has often been compared to Styx, Kansas and the Darkness.
A disastrous tour of the UK in which they supported the Stranglers during the Punk revolution of the late 70's led indirectly to the band breaking up in 1981.

With the move back to CA, Brad Love and Toby Bowen have reformed Aviary with bassist Doug Love and Drummer Guy Maturo.  You will see them performing LIVE in 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aviary">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
