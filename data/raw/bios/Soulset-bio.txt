The first Finnish Soulset was a jazz band from 60s.

*********************************************************

The second Finnish SoulSet (see the difference?) was a thrashy deathmetal band from Lappeenranta. The active years were between 1994-1995. During these years the band managed to record 2 demos and a livetape.

SoulSet started as a 2-piece project by guitarist and vocalist Tope and drummer Neuppa. Guys were 14-15 during the time and they played music that derived from Sepultura and Slayer. Tomi recorded their first demo with a 4-track tape recorder. The demo is called "Örtylkömpäkt" and it was a ferocious slab of death thrash. During that summer Leve joined the band as a bassist. When the autumn came also Tomi joined the band as the second guitarist. Jarno from Tomi's other band Mortal God joined as a vocalist. During the autumn they played many gigs and one of them was recorded and released as EvilLive live tape. The tape was circulated in the metal UG gaining the band some name.

Jarno moved away from Lappeenranta so Tope took the vocal duties to himself again. In the summer 1995 the band recorded 11-track tape called Demon '95. After this Tope went to army and the band slowly disbanded. 

Since then Tomi, Tope and Neuppa have played together in Shamos (http://www.last.fm/music/Shamos) and Elephant Bell (http://www.last.fm/music/Elephant+Bell). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soulset">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
