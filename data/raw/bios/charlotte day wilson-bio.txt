Charlotte Day Wilson is a Canadian singer-songwriter based in Toronto.

Wilson has the type of slow-burning, smoldering jazz and R&B-influenced sound that already feels classic. She has been quietly churning out songs, from the gospel-washed “Work” back in April to a guest spot in BADBADNOTGOOD’s “In Your Eyes". Her debut EP, CDW, Wilson solidifyies her timeless sound.

Getting here hasn’t been easy—the artist has been, as she says, “working [her] ass off.” Needless to say, the effort has been worth it. Wilson’s tracks have been featured everywhere from Apple Music commercials to Grace & Frankie (and, natch, our playlists), and the singer undertook a tour with Local Natives. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Charlotte+Day+Wilson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
