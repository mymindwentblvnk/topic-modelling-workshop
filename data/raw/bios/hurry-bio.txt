Hurry is an American indie rock/power pop band formed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 2012. The band is composed of Matt Scottoline (vocals, guitar), Joe DeCarolis (bass), and Rob DeCarolis (drums). Hurry began as a solo project for principal songwriter Matt Scottoline, bassist of emo revival band Everyone Everywhere. He wrote the first ten to twenty Hurry songs as a way to write his own material and play guitar rather than bass. Scottoline decided to release his home recordings on Bandcamp under the moniker "Hurry," chosen as a self-deprecating joke about his writing process; he writes quickly and rarely finishes a song if it is not completed in a single session. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hurry">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
