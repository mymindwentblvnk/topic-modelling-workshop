Scorcher (real name Tayo Jarrett) is a grime MC and producer from North London. He began his career in Cold Blooded where he became known for his 'shank' bars, and would regularly attend pirate radio and work his way up through the North London grime circuit. Scorcher had to serve a prison sentence for a short period of time in 2006, and while in jail his mixtape Simply The Best dropped and was greeted with good reviews from the grime scene. Many believe 2005 to mid 2006 was when Scorcher was at the peak of his ability as a grime MC, his bars from that time can be heard on Rinse Sessions.

After an incident with fellow Cold Blooded member Cookie, Scorcher left Cold Blooded to concentrate on a new collective known as The Movement, which featured Scorcher alongside Wretch 32, Mercston, Ghetto and Devlin. At this point he was involved in a momentous clash that saw him and fellow movement members go up against rival grime collective Boy Better Know. Scorcher did 3 dubs directed at Wiley, Jammer and Frisco.

Scorcher also produces beats, and Thunder Power was a release that was made up of entirely his won production. He has produced beats such as 'Way Down The Road', 'Beef with T', 'Igloo Remix', 'Talk of the Ghetto' and others which have been big through the year of 2006.
