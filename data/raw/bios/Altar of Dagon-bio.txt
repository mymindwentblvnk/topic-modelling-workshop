Altar of Dagon are a metal band based in Newark, Delaware. Rising from the ashes of Alazith in 2007, We are Heavily Influenced by The Necronomicon, Lovecraftian Lore, Fantasy, Horror & Sci fi. We take different story concepts and put them into song form and create a unique blend of Dark musical story telling.

Inspired by metal mainstays Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Exodus, Iced Earth,
Nevermore ,Judas Priest and Danzig, they incorporate heavier thrash metal, black metal and death metal elements, citing Slayer, Nile, and Morbid Angel as heavier influences. Ominous overtones of Type O-Negative, GWAR and Cradle of Filth highlight the bandâ€™s gothic, fantasy and symphonic metal leanings.
