A German audio story series. Originally aimed at early teenagers this series has matured slightly in the recent years as the original listeners, now adults and some with their own children, have returned to the series.

Known in English as The Three Investigators, from an original story by Robert Arthur, this is a detective series about three boys who have their own detective office, and investigate all manner of puzzles and mysteries.

They were originally sold as narrated by Alfred Hitchcock, but this was later dropped.

Due to licensing issues the series was cancelled between 2004 and 2008. A replacement series, called Die Dr3i, continued in the meantime with the same voice actors with only slight changes to names and circumstances sufficient to avoid copyright problems. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Die+Drei+Fragezeichen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
