There are three Trevor Jacksons. 

1) Trevor Jackson (born August 30, 1996) is an American film, television, and theater actor, writer, singer, and dancer. He is best known for playing Kevin Blake on Syfy original series Eureka, and for playing Kris McDuffy on Disney Channel's hit movie Let It Shine. Other notables appearances include Broadway musical The Lion King, where he played the Young Simba, and television guest star roles on both Cold Case and Harry's Law. In 2012, he won the Young Artist Awards for Best Performance in a TV Series

2) Trevor Jackson are a two man band, composed of Boots Factor from Stephen Kellogg and the Sixers and Kyle Riabko, a young Canadian guitarist/singer/songwriter. They have recently released their first record and are based out of Brooklyn. 

3) Trevor Jackson is founder of Output Records (1996-2006) and lead member of Playgroup. Output were one of the most on-trend labels of their time, releasing early LPs by Mu, Four Tet, LCD Soundsystem, The Rapture and others. Playgroup, meanwhile, do a clever mix of New Wave, post-punk, disco and house packaged up in shiny-shiny production. Jackson is also a sought-after DJ, which is what he seems to spend most of his time doing right now.  Trevor also releases music under his name, remixes artists as The Underdog, does trip hop under his guise as Skull and started a new project in 2017 as Pink Lunch.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trevor+Jackson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
