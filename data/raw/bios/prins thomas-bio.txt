Prins Thomas is responsible for a swag of the eclectic ‘space-disco’ sounds emanating from his homeland, Norway. 

Prins Thomas first poked his head up in dance circles in 2003, joining forces with pal Lindstrøm to bring a new kind of vibe to disco circles, one that was as in love with instrumental rock and noodly seventies jazz as dusty old disco gems. Peer over the decks at their early gigs and it appeared that Prins was the DJ and Lindstrøm was the live act, but recently Prins has struck out on his own, producing for labels such as Kompakt, Mindless Boogie and his own imprint Full Pupp (Check his 'Ferrara' twelve for the dirtiest bass action of 2006).

As a DJ, Prins brings a bit of a live vibe to his sets, as evidenced by his debut mix CD 'Cosmo Galactic Prism' this summer, which took the prize for the most super-eclectic tracklist of the year, finding room for Hawkwind, Joe Meek and even Bob James amid the beats. Likewise for his RA Podcast, Prins spins a set made up of a whole lot of names we haven't quite heard of, and some we have, but the rarity of the cuts is part of the pleasure. As is the length. "It's a 'set' from A-Z, done as compressed and short as I can," explains Prins. "It would be different if I was happy doing strictly minimal sets or something but that's not where I'm from..."
