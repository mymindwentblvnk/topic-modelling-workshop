From the makers of North Sea Radio Orchestra comes ARCH GARRISON.
There is a house by a river by a village by the South Wiltshire Downs in which NSRO's Craig and Sharron Fortnam live. All manner of flora and fauna were the backdrop to the creation of first album, 'King of the Down'; written, recorded and performed by Craig with additional vocals by Sharron, and features songs about the Mighty Thames, Roman roads, ditches and mounds, vapour trails and mental un-health.

When playing live, Arch Garrison are a three-piece:
Craig - guitar, vocal
James - keys, vocal
Sharron - bass, vocal <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arch+Garrison">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
