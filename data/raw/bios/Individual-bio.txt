There's more than one band called Individual.

Individual (Spain) was born at the end of 2001 in Sagunto. Since then, they have self-edited 3 demos, "Weekend (2003), "This time" (2004) and "How long is now" (2006). The last one that was produced by Jesús Sáez, member of Polar and Llum, it was mastered by Matthew Barnhart. That recording got the favour of the critics allowing the band to reach a major recognition for being semi-finalists of "Proyecto Demo 2007", organized by the FIB Heineken, and above all for being the winners of the contest "Grupo Revelación Nacional 2007" of the Contempopranea Festival.

At the end of 2007, Individual signed a deal with the Spanish indie label Junk Records. In June 16th 2008 their first album was released. The album titled "Fantastic Smile" was registered in Tigruss Studio (Gandía) and it was mixed and mastered in the Echo Lab studios, Danton (Texas), by Matthew Barnhart, producer & live engineer of bands such as: Centro-matic/South San Gabriel, Midlake, Spoon, The Baptist General, The New Year and Polar, among others.

As a curiosity, Individual is formed by members of two other bands. On one side, Índigo from Valencia that have brought out two albums for Junk Records. And on the other hand, Pleasant Dreams from Castellón whose first album for the Sevillian label Green Ufos came to light in April 2008.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Individual">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
