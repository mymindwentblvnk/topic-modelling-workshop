"CYBERSTRIKE was formed by lead guitarist/vocalist, Dave Diamond, in August of 2009. In September of that same year, he was joined by drummer (and meade hornist) James Spaeth and bass player Brian Sprouse. All that was still needed was a KILLER lead guitarist:--Raul Logan!  With the line-up complete and the focus and dedication the same, the guys began their journey to bring their music to the masses. A mix of old school thrash with a touch of European power metal and a hint of modern day metal." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cyber+Strike">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
