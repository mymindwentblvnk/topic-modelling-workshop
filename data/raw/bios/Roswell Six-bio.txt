R O S W E L L   S I X : 
International bestselling author Kevin J. Anderson has created an incredible fantasy universe with sailing ships, sea monsters, and the crusades. The first novel, TERRA INCOGNITA: THE EDGE OF THE WORLD, will be in stores in June from Orbit Books.

Anderson's works have always been heavily influenced by music, especially progressive rock — but TERRA INCOGNITA truly takes this into new territory. In a groundbreaking crossover project, Anderson developed and expanded one of the novel's storylines to form the basis of an epic rock CD from ProgRock Records, TERRA INCOGNITA: BEYOND THE HORIZON, under the band name "Roswell Six." Anderson and his wife, bestselling author Rebecca Moesta, wrote all the lyrics to the songs.

Accomplished keyboardist and composer Erik Norlander, well known for his band ROCKET SCIENTISTS as well as his solo CDs, came aboard at the beginning of the project to write the music and to helm the production chores. His wife Lana Lane, the "Queen of Symphonic Rock," provides the female lead vocals. Bassist Kurt Barabas (AMARAN'S PLIGHT) and Executive Producer Shawn Gordon from ProgRock Records round out the members of "Roswell Six" for TERRA INCOGNITA: BEYOND THE HORIZON. The CD's male vocals are by James LaBrie (DREAM THEATER), Michael Sadler (ex-SAGA), and John Payne (ASIA Featuring John Payne). 

Among the accomplished musicians contributing their talents to the project are David Ragsdale (KANSAS), Gary Wehrkamp (Shadow Gallery), Chris Quirarte (Prymary) and Chris Brown (Ghost Circus), and Mike Alvarez. Together, the creative team has sold over 40 million copies worldwide.

TERRA INCOGNITA is a synergistic project unlike anything ever seen in the publishing and music business — an original novel and original CD from the same author. Kevin J. Anderson is currently writing the second novel in the epic TERRA INCOGNITA trilogy, THE MAP OF ALL THINGS.
