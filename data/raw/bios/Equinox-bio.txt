11. Progressive metal band from Serbia 
The band was created in the autumn of 2007 and it comes from the capital of Serbia,Belgrade.It is mostly influenced by the bands such as Pain Of Salvation and Dream Theater.During the period of one year,the band was working hard and as a result,a mini EP was recorded in the winter of 2008/2009.''Leaving Behind'' contains four songs which will justify the mention of above mentioned bands...Even though there were serious problems with stability of the line-up (a guitarist,a bassist and four keyboardists were replaced) the band is now in a stable setting and in an active search for a new keyboardist and adequate vocal.

13. A United States black/death metal band from Florida.

14. An American DJ/Producer specialising in House and Electronic/Dance. 
Equinox is a producer/DJ reigning from San Diego, CA who uses all aspects of musical influence to put songs together. Beginning as a drummer in a deathcore (metal) band, he slowly became interested in electronic dance music (EDM). With quick interests in dubstep, electro house, house, Equinox felt like this was something he could become apart of. With countless crappy takes on FL Studio, Equinox learned his way through it and got deep into the producing mode. With random melodies, basslines and rhythms stuck in his head, he brings them to life and shares with all listeners willing to press "play". (Abraham Laguna's words)
