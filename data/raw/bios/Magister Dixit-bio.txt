Magister Dixit's music, polished and refined for 10 years already, is situated at the borders of progressive jazz-rock and poetic songs "with uplifting lyrics". Their ecstatic fusion-like fevered fantasy tale takes us on a strange universe of fairies, witches, genies, tightrope walkers and other forest sprites. Sometimes humming and saturated, sometimes swinging and light, Magister Dixit oscillates between dark and shimmering moods, incantatory oratorios, voluble onomatopoeias and dazing choruses. A unique alchemy to discover urgently! © Maxence BILSKI - Zwenskaïa -
