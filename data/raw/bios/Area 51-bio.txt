There are, at least, seven acts known as Area 51:

1) A rap trio consisting of an African American (MC Random), Hispanic (Apakalips) & Caucasian (Crow Magnum), emcees from the LA, CA area. They have released multiple projects, most notably "Independent's Day" released on Raptalk Records (2008).

2) An alias of Dan Nyman.

3) A continuation of Michiel van der Kuy's solo project, Rygar - well known to many synthdance fans. He is the man behind many Laserdance, KOTO & Proxyon tracks, one of the greatest synthdance composers / producers ever.  During the latter half of 80's, Michiel van der Kuy established his own record label, called "Made Up Records". His label was releasing mainly italo disco music, composed and produced entirely by Michiel. There were also some instrumental tracks released (under the name of "Rygar"): "Space Raiders", "Star Tracks", "Hexameron" and "Adagio". Although those synthdance tracks gathered large popularity, a full lenght album of Rygar hasn't been released at that time. http://discogs.com/artist/Area+51+%285%29
