In 2012 Logic of Denial proudly joins forces with Comatose Music for a new 2013 release! The band is now ready to unleash their second full length album titled ‘Atonement’. Mastered at the mighty Hertz Studios and thematically focused on the fields of expiation and catharsis. Eleven tracks of blasting death metal brutality, where the process of atonement could represent the ravenous, sick, odd and contradictory side of human and in-human existence. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Logic+of+Denial">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
