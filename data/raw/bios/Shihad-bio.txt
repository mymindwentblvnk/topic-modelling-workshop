Shihad is a four-piece band from Wellington, New Zealand, comprised of Jon Toogood (guitar/vocals), Tom Larkin (drums), Karl Kippenberger (bass) and Phil Knight (guitar). They were briefly known as "Pacifier" when they were trying to break into the US market between 2002 to 2004, because their label felt that Shihad sounded too much like the Arabic word 'jihad'.

Killjoy - 1995
Shihad - 1996

In the course of their career, Shihad has toured with and supported rock acts such as Faith No More, Filter, Mot√∂rhead, Metallica, AC/DC, Ash, Silverchair and Fu Manchu, and has a reputation for energetic and powerful live performances. Despite a huge following in New Zealand and Australia, Shihad has never attained significant mainstream success outside of Australasia.
