Marine Girls was an English post-punk group from Hatfield formed in 1980 by two sixth form schoolfriends; Tracey Thorn (prior to Everything But the Girl) and Gina Hartman. The two were later joined by sisters Alice Fox and Jane Fox. 

The band released their debut album Beach Party in 1981. Snapped up by indie Cherry Red, their follow-up (and final) album was Lazy Ways released in 1983. It was produced by Stuart Moxham from Young Marble Giants and showcased a little more polished, mature sound. Soon after its release Marine Girls disbanded: Tracey Thorn formed Everything But the Girl with label mate Ben Watt, and the Fox sisters started a new band, called Grab Grab the Haddock. 

In his journals, Kurt Cobain referred to Marine Girls album Beach Party as one of his favourite records. 

Gina Hartman continues to make music, including in the group Fenestration with Mark Flunder (formerly of TV Personalities). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Marine+Girls">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
