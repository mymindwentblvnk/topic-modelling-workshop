Misere Nobis is a depressive black metal project from Rome, Italy born in 2011 from an idea of Gris (guitars) and Torpor (drums).
The project was created with the intention to express the stat of malaise that assails man every day, and to release those instincts often suppressed, that has always characterized the human. The project involves Ø Negative (vocals), and with this formation, Misere Nobis record the first demo.
The end of 2011 was marked by two significant news: a new entry, Dave (bass), involved in projects such as Deadly Carnage and Wear and Tear, and the sign for the label Pest Productions, that release the Misere Nobis' debut album in June 2012, titled "Fade Away Gradually, My Hope...".
In October 2012 Ø Negative left the band, and a new singer replaced him in Misere Nobis: Uruksoth.
