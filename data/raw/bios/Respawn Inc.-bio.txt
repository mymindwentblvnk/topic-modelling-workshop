Since late 2000 RESPAWN INC. has been making serious waves. Raw, intensive, sudatory might describe the style of RESPAWN Inc. The combination of traditional thrash metal and modern grooves will ensure mayhem in the moshpit (as proven at various gigs alongside bands like Grave Digger, Debauchery, GurD, RunAmok and many gigs in smaller and larger Clubs).


Since its foundation RESPAWN INC. released two demos (The Struggle, No. 2) which are no longer available and an album (Only Ashes Remain). They also wrote the title track for the zombie movie “Rise of the Dead” and the song “Seeds of Agression”. The film is available at www.darksun-productions.de .


The new album Stone Cold World was released in may 2007. While the first two demos and the album were an entirely self-made affair, Bjoern Daigger (guitarist for Majesty and R:I:P) and fabz shared procucing duties. The new album is even harder, yet melodic and has more metal than ever before on a respawn inc. release on it. American artist Russ Okon (www.okongraphics.com) who was responsible for the cover of the previous album has once again agreed to do the artwork.
