Brood Of Hatred is a Tunisian (North Africa) death metal band brought together in 2010 by Muhammed MÃªlki.
The band started as a one-man project, but after the recording of the debut EP, the band took shape as new members joined in and the final lineup was set.
The first EP, called "NEW ORDER OF INTELLIGENCE",recorded in February 2012, has been released on March 2012, followed by their first Album "SKINLESS AGONY" on the same year. 

Expect some haunting atmospheres guiding you throught progressive journeys and some unconventional writing inspired by the strange state of mind that characterises our band.
