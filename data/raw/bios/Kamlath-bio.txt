The international project Kamlath plays music that mixes different genres which can be characterized as dark metal while the band members call it "Siberian metal". They try to tell with their music about Siberia, its inhabitants, the pride of this great people, their destiny full of heroism and tragedy through thousands of years.

The band is founded by two Siberian musicians who recorded their debut album “Stronger Than Frost” with the help of their famous colleagues from Sweden, USA and Italy. The opus features virtuosic guitarist and Grammy nominee Mike Wead (King Diamond, Mercyful Fate, Memento Mori, ex-Candlemass), drummer and successful drumming teacher Dennis Leeflang (Sun Caged, ex-Within Temptation, ex-The Saturnine) and unique vocalist Marco Benevento (The Foreshadowing, How Like a Winter).

Mixing and mastering of “Stronger Than Frost” was performed by sound engineer Christian Ice in Rome, at Temple Of Noise Studio, while concept-art of the album is exclusively developed by Seth Siro Anton (Spiros Antoniou) from Septic Flesh. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kamlath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
