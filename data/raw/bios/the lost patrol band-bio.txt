The Lost Patrol (Band) is the music project of Swedish Punk Rock great Dennis Lyxzén. In contrast to his other projects, Refused and The International Noise Conspiracy, the sound is one that is folkish and much softer than his prior music endeavours.

In 1999, Lyxzén put together "Songs in the Key of Resistance" which was written in the political vein that Lyxzén's fans best know him for. The album received mixed reactions. Critics often blasted the album for straying from its creator's punk roots, while others were impressed by Lyxzén's ability to diversify his musical output.

The Lost Patrol Band returned in 2003 with "Songs about Running Away". According to Lyxzén, the album had been supposed to be just as subversive and political as his previous album, yet due to relationship problems, it ended up being an emotional outburst. Guests such as David Sandström (Refused), Stefan Granberg (Randy) and Lisa Miskovsky helped to make this album one of Lyxzén's most experimental.

As of 2005, Burning Heart Records reports that The Lost Patrol Band has grown from Lyxzén's solo project into a full-fledged band. This is reflected in the title of the 2005 album The Lost Patrol Band. The album also represents a further change in style, this time encompassing the upbeat sounds of 1970s/'80s power pop. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Lost+Patrol+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
