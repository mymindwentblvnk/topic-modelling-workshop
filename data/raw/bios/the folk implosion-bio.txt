The Folk Implosion (or occasionally The Lou Barlow Folk Implosion) was an indie rock band which formed in Boston, Massachusetts, United States in 1993. The band originally consisted of just Lou Barlow (vocals, bass) and John Davis (guitar, drums), but after Davis' departure, Barlow hired Imaad Wasif (guitar) and Russ Pollard (drums) to replace him. The band is best known for their 1995 single "Natural One" from the film "Kids". The song was a surprise hit in the United States and aside from hitting #4 on the Billboard Modern Rock Charts, also hit No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100, a rarity for an indie rock band. The band split in 2004.

Lou Barlow formed The Folk Implosion with John Davis in the 1990s as a way to explore different kinds of music that his other band Sebadoh did not normally play. "The Lou Barlow Folk Implosion," as it is sometimes called, took its name as a tribute to the band The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. Another incarnation of this band went under the name Deluxx Folk Implosion, which featured Bob Fay, who worked with Lou Barlow in Sebadoh, on drums. 
Folk Implosion briefly stepped to the forefront of the alternative rock scene with their song Natural One which was featured on the soundtrack to the movie Kids (Kids) and received strong airplay on alternative rock format radio stations.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Folk+Implosion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
