A drums and bass heavy trio with a pop sensibility. Rhythmic. Occasionally danceable. Mark Robinson was in UNREST and AIR MIAMI. Nattles was a member of COLD COLD HEARTS. Matt Datesman (M.D.) still rocks with Charlottesville, VA's TRUE LOVE ALWAYS. All three members lived in New Jersey when they were younger. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flin+Flon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
