Al Iblis was formed sometime in 2002 in Davao City, Philippines. The music tackles the conflict in the middle east, as well as the broader conflict between the east and the western powers. Their music is a fusion of death metal, doom, grindcore genres with a wee bit of middle eastern flavour thrown in.

Their first offal - Righteous Hegemony is unavailable, the ones on youtube are from their second EP released in 2002 entitled Hashmadat Goyem, the recording is poor, but according to some reviews their music is enjoyable. 

The band ceased to perform when their drummer left for the UK in late 2002.
