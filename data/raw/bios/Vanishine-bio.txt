VaniShine's music is heavy, and melodic, but also direct, and fresh, (straight to the heart). A Sound easy to listen to, and songs that arise from the soul. In one hand a lyrical female voice and the keyboards, in the other hand the drums, the guitar and the bass-guitar. Together they create ​​the pleasant sound of VaniShine. VaniShine is not just another band with a Female Vocalist. 
VaniShine started as late 2004, almost as a hobby, looking for that "Something" and after several tests, the group was formed at the end of 2005. And from that moment their music is being heard outside the four walls that support them every day. 
VANISHINE has recorded a Demo (GROOVE Studios, Ortuella)
