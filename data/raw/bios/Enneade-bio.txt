ENNEADE was born in 1996 of the reunion of musicians from varied musical horizons and has since then built up a serious reputation as a cutting edge prog'rock combo with a lingering 70's aftertaste.

ENNEADE indeed offers a very elaborate music with alternating moments of peaceful bliss or sheer madness, where ever-changing syncopated rhythms and heady tunes intermingle to produce a coherent and inovative whole.

After their much acclaimed debut album "Remembrance", released in 2005, by Musea Records, ENNEADE strike back with "Teardrops in morning dew", a most ambitious concept album engineered by Neil CONTI (David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Annie Lennox...) and Gines Jimenez, mixed by Christophe Arnaud ((Uncommonmenfrommars, No good men) and mastered by Frank "Choko" Rivoire (High Tone, Le peuple de l'herbe, Têtes raides, Ez3kiel).

Its leading piece, "Teardrops in mourning due" - which takes the listener along 22 minute sonic storyboard exploration of the darkest depth of mourning, truly embodies ENNEADE's music which has moved another step forward in terms of musical maturity and originality, the perfect alchemy of virtuoso and emotion.

Since the day of their inception, ENNEADE took part of many concerts and festivals alongside prominent members of the genre, as their 1998 aftershow of DREAM THEATER in Lyon (Transbordeur, Feb 20th). And they're dead set on hitting the road again...
