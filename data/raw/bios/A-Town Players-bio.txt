Comprised of MCs: Lil Redd, Bonay and DJ Len, A-Town Players were part of Atlanta's bass music scene, which exploded nationwide in 1993 with Whoomp! (There It Is) by fellow Atlanta duo Tag Team. A-Town Players released Playin' for Keeps, their debut, that same year, but didn't gain any real recognition until 1995's True Players, Vol. 1, which featured the single Wassup Wassup and was co-produced by the Egyptian Lover, aka Greg Broussard, best known for his electro-era singles Egypt Egypt and Computer Love (Sweet Dreams). Tag Team's hit was rather tame in comparison to the norm for bass music. Usually, the raunchier the tracks were, the better they sold. True to their name, A-Town Players boasted with the best of them. We Keep It Crunk for You was released in 1998, and featured songs like "Drop It Down Like That" and "Player Can't You See," the latter also appearing on Elektra's Rhythm & Quad 166, Vol. 1, a bass music compilation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A-Town+Players">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
