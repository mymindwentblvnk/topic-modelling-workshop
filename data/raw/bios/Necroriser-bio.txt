NECRORISER is a three piece Thrash/Death Metal crossover band originating in South America but now based in London, England. 

Formed in 2007 by Vermeyo and Mighell, composing new songs and reformulating other neck-thrasing melodies from their previous band, while looking for a committed and dedicated drummer who could understand the band and bring even more aggression to the tracks. 

The band finally became complete through the recommendation of a friend at the end of 2010, when Ruben Jaramillo joined the band. At the first rehearsal the trio could already think in the same way and feel that NECRORISER and have since gone from strength to strength in the London scene. 

2011 for NECRORISER has seen the band shock crowd after crowd with their powerful energy and thrash groove on stage, playing live in a host of different venues but naturally progressing the crowd reaction to insane levels ending in the inevitable mosh pit!
