Precious Bryant (1942-2013) was a U.S. blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter.

Born Precious Bussey into a family of musicians on the 4th January 1942 in Talbot County, Georgia, Bryant sang and played rural acoustic blues.  She performed at the Newport Folk Festival and Blues to Bop in Lugano, Switzerland (though later in her life she played mainly around her home state).

Bryant released two solo albums. Her 2002 debut, Fool Me Good, was nominated for two Blues Music Awards, in the categories of 'Acoustic Blues Album of the Year' and 'Best New Artist Debut'. In 2006 she was nominated for another similar award for 'Traditional Blues Female Artist of the Year', and was up against Koko Taylor, Maria Muldaur, and Etta James, the last of whom won.

Bryant died on the 12th January 2013 in Columbus, Georgia, following a six-week battle with complications from diabetes and congestive heart failure. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Precious+Bryant">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
