Bill Jennings, (Indianapolis, IN, September 12, 1919) was an American rhythm and blues and jazz guitarist.
Jenning's sound has been compared to Tiny Grimes with a hint of early Charlie Christian. A peer of Billy Butler, Jennings played with Louis Jordan in the late '40s and early '50s. He also recorded sides with Leo Parker, Bill Doggett, Wild Bill Davis, Jack McDuff, Willis "Gator" Jackson, Louis Armstrong, Hot Lips Page and others.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Jennings">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
