BIOGRAPHY
HEATHENDOM was founded by Lefteris Vourliotis (lead guitar) and Michail Vlavianos (rhythm guitar) back in 1998. The concept of the band was power/doom metal with a strong mixture of KING DIAMOND/MERCYFUL FATE style. In September 1998 Giannis Fillipaios (drums, member of DECEMBERANCE) and Yiannis Moraitis (bass, member of SAVANON and ex-member of CHOIR MACABRE and DECEMBERANCE) joined the band. Songs composing and rehearsals followed for a year, until the band decided to split because no appropriate singer could be found at the time.

In September 2000 Vourliotis met with Dimitris Koutsouvelis (vocals, ex-member of FADED MEMORY) and they started working on some material, but various obligations prevented the group from reforming, till September 2004. Moraitis was called once again to fill in the bass position and drums post was taken on by Dimitris Sakkas.

In June 2005 the band released their first demo, "Heathendom", containing 5 songs plus an intro of seer power/doom music (over 33 minutes), that was accepted with great enthusiasm in the underground scene. After some line-up changes HEATHENDOM played their first show in 2006, supporting SOLITUDE AETURNUS in Athens and in April 2008 at Up The Hammers festival, together with bands such as MANILLA ROAD, OMEN, MEMORY GARDEN and CAGE.

HEATHENDOM's full length debut CD "Nescience" is scheduled to be released in July 2008. This album should appeal not only to fans of KING DIAMOND or doom metallers, but to all those who appreciate high quality classic heavy metal played with passion and skills that are above average. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heathendom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
