This was the band Brandon from City of Caterpillar/Pg99 was in before both of those bands. Great stuff.

I was very stoked to get this CD let me tell you. KILARA's debut 7" rocked my world and I was chomping at the bit for more. Well all expectations were fulfilled. Generally speaking the band has slowed things down a lot. Their noisy, ferocious assault is still intact but on this disc they are more deliberate and plodding. The heaviness takes front and center and the steamrolling riffs are simply never ending. Their southern fried sludge, with all its abrasiveness and fury, brings to mind their kindred spirits, CAVITY, or to a lesser extent, EHG. All us U.S. residents should hope and pray that the South never again rises up in revolt, because these southern bands could be used as deadly weapons of mass destruction.
