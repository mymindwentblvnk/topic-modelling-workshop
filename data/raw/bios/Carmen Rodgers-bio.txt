Graduate of Dallas Baptist University, majoring in Psychology, Carmen Rodgers grew up in small town Mississippi, inspired to sing in church and intrigued by the sounds of Blues and funk music from her uncle's juke joint. Singing background with various Indie artists gave her a solid foundation on the music scene. Owning and operating Candigirl Music with partner Michael Reimonenq of Acoustical Endeavors Entertainment has given Carmen the ability to have free range in her creativity and business decisions. Writing and producing most of all her music has allowed her to make the sound her own.

The Bitter Suite was written and produced entirely by Ernie G. and Carmen Rodgers.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carmen+Rodgers">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
