Magic Child is a music and fashion brand established by Ian Marshall and Ashley Krantz in the summer of 2008.  The couple got their start selling vintage clothing directly though myspace and shortly after released a handful of demo material to enhance the online shopping experience.  

The initial surge of content created helped the brand establish a fan-base worldwide and continues to act as a creative outlet for Ian and Ashley. 

In 2009 Magic Child released their first line of custom apparel, and has been hard at work on their debut lp.
