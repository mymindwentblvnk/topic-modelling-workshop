MAGNITUDE 9's musical style falls into the same genre of bands such as QUEENSRYCHE, FATES WARNING, DREAM THEATER, SYMPHONY X, YNGWIE MALMSTEEN, etc., gaining the band a great following of fans worldwide, for which they are very grateful!

Magnitude 9 not only writes catchy, melodic metal songs, but they also incorporate challenging musical elements without straying away too much from the actual song itself. They fuse metal with neoclassical & prog rock.
