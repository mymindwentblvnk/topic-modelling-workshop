Raven Dark is a part of the Blazebirth Hall circle hailing from Russia and is the project of Ulv Gegner Irminsson with contributions by Kaldrad (Branikald). In 2000 Ulv decided to abandon Raven Dark and work on a new project called Wotan SÃ¸lv, which was released in 2016. Ulv also contributed to other Blazebirth Hall bands, namely Vargleide and Forest and also formed a band outside the circle known as Velimor.


On the night of October 23rd 2005 Ulv Gegner Irminsson (Evgeniy Yelmanov) was stabbed to death by his alleged friend Sergey Odokienko during a drunken quarrel that occured in Odokienko's apartment in Tula, Russia. Future plans by Stellar Winter records to honour Ulv's memory include releases of up to now unavailable early demos from Raven Dark and possible releases of Asagott which is the name Ulv later changed Raven Dark to. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Raven+Dark">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
