Violent New Breed is a band from Las Vegas, made up of Max Green (bass),  Garrett Lowery (guitar) and Nicholas Ray (drums), and Albert Schweizer (vocals).

Formed by Max Green (best known as the Co-Founder/bassist of Escape the Fate) in 2019, the Las Vegas band Violent New Breed is bringing a fresh new take on the metal genre.

Following the release of the bands aptly titled debut album, "Bad Reputation", VNB was set to tour when the pandemic struck, putting an end to those plans and ultimately the old line-up. If Violent New Breed is known for anything, it’s a relentless dedication to leaving their mark on the music industry.

Refusing to give up, Green recruited Garrett Lowery (Lead Guitar) and Nicholas Ray (Drums) and got to writing. The trio quickly caught the eyes and ears of Bobby Schubenski (Owner of Blackcraft Cult Clothing) and Danny Wimmer (Danny Wimmer Presents). This immediately led them to be guests on the highly successful “That Space Zebra Show” hosted by Bobby Schubenski on Twitch, as well as their own mini series called “The Vocalist” where open auditions were held to find the band a new singer. After a grueling competition, tons of submissions, and the help of an all too impressive audience of over 100k+ viewers, the band finally found their singer, Albert Schweizer. 

Following the completion of the new line-up, VNB has announced their first single “Bloody Lip Season” which was released March 4, 2022. Aggressive and dynamic riffs paired with infectiously catchy vocal melodies, lays a ground-breaking foundation for the listener to be fully immersed in what is now, Violent New Breed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Violent+New+Breed">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
