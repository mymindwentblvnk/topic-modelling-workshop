In Ashland Oregon, in June '05, Mason "Worms" Huggins and Adam Steinbroner met through mutual friend Inconu and began to write material and soon added Damon James on bass and John Bradley on vocals. After recording their 8-song LP "Vespertine", they added Rob "crustazn" Bebe on second guitar for a fuller sound. But things did not last that way for long as John and Rob could no longer commit to the band. They recorded the "Wolves of Valhalla" demo in summer of '06 with Inconu on vocals and then disbanded shortly while Damon moved to Portland to pursue education. The following year, Worms and Adam moved up to Portland to reunite Heathen Shrine and to get out of Ashland. They put all of their old songs in the junkyard and began to rewrite and produce new material for a faster. more brutal sound. In Feb. and Mar. '08 they recorded their 5 song EP "Subterranean realms of Gravitation" to be released through Neurot recordings. In early 2009, long time friend and heathen Tenaya Ward was incorporated into the heathen shrine fold as second guitarist making his debut April 1st. The band is currently half-way through writing their new full length which is slated to be released in winter of 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heathen+Shrine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
