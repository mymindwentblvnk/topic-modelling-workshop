Able to calculate any equation, solve any theory, and lay to waste the minds of other scientists 
he was a gift sent straight from God. Pioneer in the field of experimental military serums the 
Doctor discovered how to enhance strength, negate pain and worse of all, eradicate emotion. 
Creating an elite force of super soldiers was the goal but launch day everything went wrong...

The story is told a hundred ways but no one truly knows what happened, all that is certain is the 
only man with the answer is no longer a brilliant man of science. He is simply known as Livid, a 
self proclaimed wizard of doom, he has the power and wisdom to rule the world yet his mind, in 
shambles, falls deeper into the pits of insanity where his bloodthirsty crew of enhanced beings 
call home.

Chaos and destruction lay in wait, fore at the moment before his mind is fully gone, Livid just 
wants to have some fun...
