There at least two bands with the name Kapok:
1) an alternative rock band from Norwich, UK
2) a jazz ensemble from Utrecht, The Netherlands

1)
Kapok is currently a four piece Alternative/Rock band based in Norwich containing members:
•Joe Mazzei – Guitarist/Lead Vocalist                        
•Marcus Gooda – Bassist/Backing Vocals                                          
•Olly Kirby – Guitarist/Pianist             
•Alex Munford - Drums
Kapok formed in late 2007 as a three piece band with members Joe Mazzei, Marcus Gooda and Richard Crosby (Drums) playing original music. Shortly after band manager David Gooda joined and helped the band find gigs in and around Norwich, playing regularly at venues such as B2, Queen Charlotte, Brickmakers.
The band quickly progressed playing bigger venues such as the Waterfront with BBC Blast, Arts Centre and The Playhouse some of which have been advertised in EDP Event magazine. 

Kapok have always been renowned for their energetic performances on stage, dedicated to not just playing their music but putting on a memorable performance that any audience is likely to remember. Although this has been their mentality from the start the addition of wireless guitars has allowed members of the band to run around the stage, spin off into the crowd and make their appearance onto stage from behind the audience!
During the summer of 08 the three piece recorded a 10 track album named Imperfectionism including tracks:
•Jimmy Black
•Difference Between Dogs and Men
•Innocent Stranger
•Bridge to Nowhere
•Like No One
•Not Enough
•No Mess No Lies
•Perfect Morning
•Too Short To Waste
•Long Distance Love
The band recorded the entire album themselves throughout the summer and released it at the beginning of October doing a limited run of 200 copies which sold out within the month. Tracks from the Imperfectionism album have been played on BBC Norfolk Introducing and Future Radio.
Shortly after band member Richard Crosby left the band for Uni but was promptly replaced by Alex Munford. Soon after Olly Kirby joined to form the four piece Kapok are known as today and since the four piece have been together they’ve continued to write and produce music regularly.
Kapok’s latest release Ignorance Is Choice is the bands most ambitious project to date, yet again fully produced themselves including tracks:
•Ignorance Is Choice
•You Know Your Heart
•No Mess No Lies
•Bridge To Nowhere
