Nepara is a duo of Alexandr Shoua and Viktoriya Talshinskaja formed in 2002. Both artists claim themselves being apart from the media, which is not common to the standards of Russian show-business. The debut album Другая семья was released in 2003, while the second album Все сначала… was released in 2006.
