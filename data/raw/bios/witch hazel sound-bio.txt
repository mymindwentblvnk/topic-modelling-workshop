The Witch Hazel Sound is the brainchild of Kent, Ohio based producer and multi-instrumentalist Kevin Coral, a self-confessed music junkie with a twin passion for production and rare obscure vinyl. The band have released three acclaimed albums to date, the latest "This World, then the fireworks..." has just been re-issued by French label, Euro Visions (http://www.euro-visions.net/). As well as carving out gorgeous teenage symphonies to God for the WHS, Kevin has done a bit of moonlighting in the shape of production duties for a stack of projects all over the world including, the likes of Swedish indie pop favourites, Club 8; California indie pop queen, Laura Watling; US psych pop band, The New Planet Trampoline; French artist, Jean-Emmanuel Deluxe and is about to work with 70's UK pop obscurity, John Howard. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Witch+Hazel+Sound">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
