Embers Arise is a result of two bands joining forces
due to the lack of members. The bands were:

Headcase
Fredrik Lunström(Guitar), Kristoffer Pozzi(Drums),
Arvid Möller(Vocals) and Erik Sandén(Bass)

Tierra Ideal
Nicklas Börstell(Vocals, Keyboard) and Magnus Andersson(Guitar)

They started to play together in the fall of 2004
and started to record their first demo in the end of
November the same year. It turned out to be a selftitled six-track
demo recorded in Studio Skyline, Eskilstuna, and it was released
in Januari 2005. After that Erik deicided to leave EA due to other
obligations. EA continued to play some local gigs without a
bassplayer in their hometown Eskilstuna.

In June 2005 it was time to record a second demo and this
took place in Studio Ambassaden at Balsta Musikslott in Eskilstuna,
in the same building where EA rehearses.
The demo was recorded during 3 days and it was released the same
month, but EA felt that they had to re-mix the demo so another
version was released in the end of July. The demo was unnamed at
first but has later been called "The Circle". Shortly after the
recording sessions EA found a new bassplayer in Mikael Angréus.
He is now a permanent member and performed live for the first
time with EA at Sommarens Sista Suck in August 2005.

EA continued to play gigs in Eskilstuna but they also went away to
play in Borlänge, Stockholm and in Västerås. In Västerås they had the
privilege to support Dismember and Darkane.

EA are now planning a third demo recording sometime in the spring of 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Embers+Arise">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
