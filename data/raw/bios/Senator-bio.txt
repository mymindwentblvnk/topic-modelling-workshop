1) Being able to operate completely outside the typical machinations of music - independent or otherwise Senator are going to carve out a sizeable niche in the sewage-infested gutters of underground rock & roll. After sending a demo tape to the infamous engineer and guitarist Steve Albini (ex-Just Ducky, Big Black, Rapeman) the legendary Nirvana producer invited the Scottish trio (Nick Middlemiss vocals/guitar, Tom Lee Bass,  & Ross McLennan Drums) to his US electrical audio studios to produce their debut album "United Wire". This stunning debut exposes the true heart and art of Senator's music utilising the tight rhythms of  McLennan and seismic bass of  Lee clearly removes Senator from your usual rock fodder whilst still keeping a raw well honed sound.
All the tracks are delivered with speed and a precision which imparts beautiful clarity and razor sharp edges the playing on 'Tarnish All' and 'The Nymphet Test' somehow achieve simultaneous gentleness and violence, the cold metal of the scalpel and the cold metal of wire. This album will appeal to fans of Shellac & Nirvana.
