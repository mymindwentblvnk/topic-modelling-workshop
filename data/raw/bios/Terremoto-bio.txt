Terremoto is in need of a drummer and a bassist (with backing vocals) to play shows in the Washington, DC area.  We play the songs featured on this page.  If interested please contact themotos@gmail.com.  Thanks, and looking forward to hearing from you!
Terremoto, short for Terrestrial Motion, uses sublime melodies balanced with core-rocking guitar riffage and blunt lyrics to confront the spiritual and moral dilemma of modern America. 
The band formed in 2003 after listening to MxPx's old school punk sounds on their album "Let it Happen,"  and over time grew to encompass a wide variety of styles and sounds so as to not have a clear genre.  
There is a predominant influence of grunge, rock, and punk, combined with quick-witted lyrics and intense, even Beatleseque, melodies that sometimes surfaces the likes of acoustic, surf, and ska. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Terremoto">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
