Black Freighter is a dark and sludgy hardcore band from Leipzig/Germany (even though some members now live in Göttingen and Jena). The band was founded in 2008 and played their first show in September of the same year. Their first release was a 12“ split LP with crowskin from Potsdam on the Berlin based label vendetta records in the late summer of 2009. A two weeks European tour together with planks followed in the fall of 2009. In early 2010 saw the release of the bands first full length LP, again on vendetta records as well as a lot of touring all over the place. They disbanded at the end of 2010

Members of black freighter also play in ghost of the government (70s prog/post rock) and bauns`s backstube (dark industrial dubstep and electronica). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Freighter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
