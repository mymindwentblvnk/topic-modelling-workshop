There are three bands that fall under the name ART: a 60s British psychedelic rock band, a band from the early 80s and a 2010-present Slovak Instrumental Electric Cello Music band.

1. The late '60s incarnation: A 'progressive' outfit, Art later evolved into Spooky Tooth in October 1967 with the addition of Gary Wright. Their finest moment was What's That Sound, which was a rehash of Buffalo Springfield's superb For What It's Worth. It's now quite hard to obtain but was included on Island's You Can All Join In compilation. 
Their album is adventurous and quite unique British psychedelic rock. It's quite primitive in places, but utilises a wide range of instruments with plenty of sound effects and variety, although side two is a bit nondescript. Guy Stevens handled the production duties. It's well worth a spin.

2. The early '80s incarnation was a "snide anti-new wave new wave band" led by provocateur Mykel Board. Their best known song was "Ugly People with Fancy Hairdos," which served as a searing indictment of pretty much everyone. Try to listen to it and refrain yourself from yelling, "Oh SNAP!" or, "BURN!" You can't. You can't.

3. 2010-present has nothing to do with the previous two British bands. Despite playing mostly progressive symphonic metal tunes. This original instrumental was created by cello player Slavo Repaský, who called for help from the most fairest, who made ART what it is now: Pavel Vandy Prokop - drums, Kristián Kadlečík - bass guitar, Ivan Jelenčič, who sees through his fingers, what You can see through your eyes - keyboard.
Music is mostly inspired by legends like: Bach, Vivaldi or Mozart and adds a little mix from OST from movies like: Terminator, The Last of the Mohicans, Pirates of the Caribbean...
