Violet Sun is an Italian symphonic metal band. The band consists of Alessandra Amata (lead vocals, piano), Alex Grillo (drum, percussions) and Dario Grillo (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards, orchestral scores, production).

The idea to create the band came out in 2005 for the will of Dario Grillo after hearing Alessandra Amata, a singer of great talent of Catania well known in the Sicilian musical circle. He had some very interesting unpublished work that Dario proposed to her. Alessandra immediately showed herself very enthusiastic about the project and so in a few months they began to work to the drawing up and the realization of the songs contained in Loneliness in supremacy, the album in question.

Loneliness in supremacy is not a normal Metal album, but a real work in which the classic and opera music, heavy metal, oriental, progressive, Aor music and so on, blend perfectly together to create some melodies of great impact and always charming. Moreover the peculiarity of the record is just the atypical voice of Alessandra, singer endowed with a particular timbre of voice “full” and “powerful”, not at all in line with the fading and slight voices of the gothic symphonic metal production. It is just this peculiarity that induced Dario to realize the record in question and to enhance the vocal originality and of the songwriting as to a market which proposes bands equal to one another from a certain times. This record places itself midway between a real Metal Opera (I remember Avantasia, Aina, Nostradamus and so on) and bands as Nightwish, Epica, Kamelot and I think that is just this the strong point of the VIOLET SUN. They have been able to create something that has a very high selling power if inserted in the right distribution channels.
