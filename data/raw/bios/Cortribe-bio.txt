This band started in autumn 2004, when two ex-members from Dementor met again after a long time, drum player Peter Stenda and guitar player Alexander Suchacek. After short time Michal Milec joined this young metal band and they decided to start off their career. This trio were writing their own lyrics and music in nu-metal style. After a long time of looking for a perfect singer, they adverted this position online hoping to find the right person. Luckily Mato Rafa was the one who met all our criteria of perfect singer. Our concerts were performed without a bass guitar player â€“ and this position was shortly filled by Tomax (ex-member of Galadriel, at the moment playing with Karpina). Unfortunately, Tomax was very busy so we had to replace him with Ivan Mesaros. Everything was running smoothly. However, the clash of personalities between Peter and the rest of the band caused a failure of existence of Cortribe for almost one year. Michal was very determined and he managed to bring Pater Hornik (a new drum player) to start to play with us. But at this moment Mato (singer) decided to leave. Therefore the band started from scratch. The music is more aggressive and technical. As Michal left the country in September 2006, Martin Struhar was our new guitar player who was a benefit for this band. At the end of 2006 with Majo (a new singer) joined the band and we managed to record our first demo. Peter Stenda rejoined the band at the beginning of 2007..  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cortribe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
