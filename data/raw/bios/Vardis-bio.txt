Vardis originate from the North of England and became fully professional in 1978 forming a prominent part of the British Heavy Metal scene. They consist of front man Steve Zodiac on guitar and lead vocals, Terry Horbury on bass guitar and Joe Clancy on drums. Vardis quickly gained notoriety for very special live performances with a unique approach of incorporating elements of 1970's glam, punk, blues with Heavy Metal Rock’n’Roll.

Vardis were/are influenced by every musical force known to mankind to create a unique and lasting sound. Steve Zodiac walked away from the music business in 1986 never to return until now! 27 years later Vardis are re-united and will play selected shows. www.VardisRocks.com
