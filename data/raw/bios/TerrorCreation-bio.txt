TerrorCreation was formed in 2004 by Timo and Taavetti, who were completely without a band after their former band had split.

They wanted to play thrash metal, and so the band's concept was a clear cut. They needed more players, and they asked Tuomas if he wanted to play the drums. He accepted, and told them that his brother Juho plays guitar, and was without a band. Juho joined the band same time as Tuomas.

They also needed a vocalist, so Timo called Jere, if he would have any interest. Jere agreed to do the vocals, and there it was. A Band.
