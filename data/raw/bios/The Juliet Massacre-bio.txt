. The band has influences from death metal, metalcore and deathcore to bring together the Italian strain of deathcore. They fuse together the deep growls with screams of the vocalist, the raging guitars with fluttering solos and the furious drums with breakdowns perfectly executed. 

PiPPo joined on guitar soon after the first demo release in 2006 after the departure of Losk. Also, Mariano "The Ice" (Guitars) joined from audtions. They quickly toured around the local town and cities in their homeland Italy. However, The Ice left soon after coming via auditions in 2007 which lead to the demo release of their second demo without a second guitarist. "The Juliet Massacre", the band's second release, accounted six well produced songs which fired furious drumming, catchy riffs and deep vocal extremes. 

After some time, the band was joined by the very talented Saverio "Savelli" Tarantini (Guitars, Hidden Disturbances) who has since participated in the new demo "Bleeding the Black Blood" released in late 2008. The band is set to do a tour with Origin and are currently writing new material for a possible 2009 debut album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Juliet+Massacre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
