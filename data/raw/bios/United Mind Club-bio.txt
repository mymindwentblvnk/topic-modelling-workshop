Tver music band United Mind Club appeared in 2008. Their music has been experimental form the beginning, and is a mix of different kinds of metal. Base of the style is the modern metal, with Eastern melodies and powerful guitar. The songs structure is uncommon, close to progressive. The songs lyrics are based on life realms and philosophy. Meeting incompatible music genres in one music track, United Mind Club crates songs using new trends. This forms their own style and makes it recognizable. 


Fall 2008 –the single The Last Performance (Arsenal studio) is released. It consists of three tracks: The Signs of dominance, Weak Man’s Mantra, The Reverse Side.
