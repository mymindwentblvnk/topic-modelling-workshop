Alexandra Streliski is a Montreal-based pianist and composer. Evoking Satie, Glass and Tiersen, her music is distinguished by its simplicity and the truth of its notes. Imbued with both melancholy and light, her first album, "Pianoscope" (december 2010), transports its audience into a dreamy and cinematic universe. As of today, her music is part of several film and commercial projects.
