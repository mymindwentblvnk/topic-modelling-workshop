[Important note: don't confound this band with Metallica. The word METALL with double L is simply Metal written in German alluding to the heavy metal from that country]

The band METALL was founded 1982 in the GDR. In beginning 1985 they had a stable line-up with Thomas Post, Roland Tschech, Uwe Lerach, Ronald Schulze, Sven Rappoldt. In this times the band recorded some titles for bigger GDR radiostations. Titles like "Easy Rider" & "Vulcane der Erde" are often on 1. place in rock & Metal charts! 1988 name changing in HEADLESS, more titles recorded and for the first time on vinyl (Split LP "Speed Up" on Label Z).

About different problems the band split in 1991. Restart in august 2013 with founder and old member Sven Rappoldt (also known as owner of legendary Halford Metal Bar in Berlin). Since then the band has played many gigs at Taunus Metal Fest, Rude Open Air or as Opener for swedish heavy band Bullet. In beginning 2017 the recordings for first full CD "Metal Heads" are finished, on this you can hear the full spectrum of real Heavy Metal, from epic stuff like "Riding On The Storm" until to aggressive attacks like "Wrath"! ... of course:

PURE METALL \m/
