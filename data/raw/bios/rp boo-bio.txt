RP Boo, a.k.a. Arpebu is basically the godfather of footwork as a genre of music, taking juke from a 4-on-the-floor house pattern to the bent bass that changed the sound forever. One of his pivotal moments was when he butchered the pitch of a now deceased Wu Tang member’s voice into an even more staggering utterance on Baby Come On. He was also part of House–O–Matics along with several other DJs back in the mid 90s, one of the OG footwork crews.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/RP+Boo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
