We are a mexican melodic black-death metal band that arose in 2008. The most important thing is to make known our musical concept, which is inspired by the prehispanic cultures, recovering the importance of our roots through powerful sounds creating the energy and the force in each song in order to transmit them to everyone who listens to them. We take back topics like the meaning of death in poetry, of all those that spilled their blood and that are our legends now, beliefs of what the only world was.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Souls">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
