Cocoa Brovaz is a Brooklyn based hip hop group consisting of members Tek & Steele. Originally known as Smif-N-Wessun, they ran into legal issues with Smith & Wesson Firearms after the release of their first album Dah Shinin'. To avoid the lawsuit, they decided to change their name to the Cocoa Brovaz in 1996. In early 1998, they dropped their second album The Rude Awakening under this name. In September 2005, they returned as Smif-N-Wessun for the album Smif 'n' Wessun: Reloaded. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cocoa+Brovaz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
