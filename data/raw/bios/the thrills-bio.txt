There has been more than one artist known as The Thrills.

1. The Thrills are an Irish indie rock band, formed in 2001 in Dublin. The band is made up of lead vocalist Conor Deasy, guitarist Daniel Ryan, bass player Padraic McMahon, pianist Kevin Horan and drummer Ben Carrigan. 

Their big break came with their debut album So Much for the City (2003) which became an Irish number one. The five members spent a month on vacation in San Diego where they wrote several of the tracks for the album such as One Horse Town. The band have since recorded two further albums Let's Bottle Bohemia (2004) and Teenager (2007). 

The band often cites Neil Young, The Beach Boys and The Monkees as its main inspirations. The band took part in the Band Aid 20 charity assemble in 2004.

2. The Thrills was a punk band that formed in Boston in 1977. During the first wave of punk, they were one of Boston's most popular bands, in large part due to singer Barb Kitson's commanding voice and punky-starlet looks. They changed names in 1980 due to a name conflict, and went on to release the City Thrills EP in 1981.

3. The Thrills were a soul 'girl group' of the 1960s, who released a string of singles for Capitol Records in 1966. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Thrills">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
