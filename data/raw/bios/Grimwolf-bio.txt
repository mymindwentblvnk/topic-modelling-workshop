Pure American Werewolf Metal. If that does not say it all then nothing will. Werewolf clan "GrimWolf" has stormed onto the music sceen with their animalistic style of metal. Giving tribute to their metal influences of the past and forging forward with their niche of the metal world. Music that inspires the primal side of the human mind to dominate and to feast upon all who tread in their path.

Their music is melodic and agressive, not wimpy or whiney, just pure brutatlity when they hit the stage. Their music has been likened to Metallica, Megadeth and other early metal bands. Brent's vocals are savage and primal akin to death metal vocalists of the past <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/GrimWolf">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
