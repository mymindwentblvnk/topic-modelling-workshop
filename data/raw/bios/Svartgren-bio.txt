Svartgren is a raw black metal project from Belgrade, Serbia. 
The band was formerly known as Lapot.

The goat cult of Svartgren emerged in the begining of 2003. Due to the line-up problems the band was on hold until late 2004. The first demo 'Morrabrod' was recorded in early 2005. Zoltan joined as the band's drum player in winter 2005. The second Svartgren demo "Lasraeher Egnaro" was born in December 2005 and Aleksandar joined as bass player, apparently, in early 2006. 

Both mentioned demos were actually released under the name Lapot.
