Atomicy, a group of which who's love of music had brought them together as a full band in late winter season of 2005. Percussionist, Ty Mercer, & Rhythm/Lead Guitarist, Steve Verschuuren had been searching for key members to fill the gaps in their current band. Meanwhile, Rhythm/Lead Guitarist, Matt Lamb, and Bassist/Vocalist, Morgan Rider, were searching for a band to play in.

The 4 had been friends for some time now and went to see eachothers former bands play countless times. Then one night, the 4 decided that they should become a band. With great knowledge of musical theory and each band member striving to perfect their instruments, the group known as Atomicy soldiered on.

Atomicy, a thunderous assault of traditional thrash riffs, face melting guitar duels, booming bass lines, in your face vocals, and pumelling percussion continues to conquer each and every obstacle in its way and at the same time, have a hell of a time.
