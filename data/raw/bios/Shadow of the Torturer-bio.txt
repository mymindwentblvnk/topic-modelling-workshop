Shadow of the Torturer is a Seattle, US-based metal band fronted by ex-Aldebaran frontman Mikey Brown. The band was formed by Brown in 2006, together with Isamu Sato (H.C. Minds, ex-YOB) and Gabe Morley (ex-Rye Wolves). The project originally served as an outlet of Brown's wish to pursue the "deathier sound of doom", and since Brown left Aldebaran, it has now become his full time band.

The current members are Mike Brown (guitar/vocals), Thor (drums) and B-Bench (bass). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shadow+of+the+Torturer">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
