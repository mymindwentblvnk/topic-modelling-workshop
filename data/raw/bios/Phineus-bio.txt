Phineus was a prophet who angered the gods by fortelling too much.  As punishment he was blinded and exiled to an island.  Then the gods decided that wasn't a bad enough punishment so they sent Harpies to steal his lunch every day for eternity.

Giant Hand and  Harry 1 were created via granular re-sampling and soft-synths.  The music was performed with Max/MSP software and Reaktor 5 software via a monome 40h controller and patches written by tehn, kid sputnik, and others (see monome.org).

Music is around us all the time, even as we sit silently.  The flourescents flicker, keyboards clack, doors squeak, servos whine, feet scuffle.  Then we breathe, we fidget, eat and talk.  Really, it's a symphony. - Phineus
