The band has influences across many genres and finds it exciting to be able to draw these influences to create a unique yet enticing sound. Sonic Altar work as a tight unit, and everyone has input into the writing process. Right from the formation of the band, ideas have been flowing; providing an ever-increasing repertoire. The band entertains fans at every opportunity, giving their all at every performance. At present Sonic Altar are working towards establishing a wider audience and following here in New Zealand, and allowing more people to hear and experience their music. The band is always exerting an energy that many people can relate to, and invite the world to experience this with them. 

In 2006, Sonic Altar took out the NZ final of the World Battle of the Bands leading them to the world final in Hong Kong in November '06. Over in Hong Kong the lads placed 3rd in the World. 

2007 has brought a lot more work onto the schedule than was first expected. Sonic Altar have released a 5 track EP entitled 'What You've Been Waiting For', with a music video soon to follow and embarked on a successful national tour in September through to early October '07. 

2008 brings even more exciting times for Sonic Altar. March 2008 the 6 piece will play on the same bill as legendary rockers Ozzy Osbourne and KISS on the Rock2Wgtn bill.
