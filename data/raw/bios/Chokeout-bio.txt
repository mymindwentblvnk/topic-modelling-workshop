IN 2006 CHOKEOUT WAS STARTED OUT OF THE DEMISE OF THREE OTHER BANDS, DOWNSIZE, PURITY LOST, AND PROLIFIC. THE FOUNDING MEMBERS SHANNON GUTHRIE (VOCALS), AARON FOSS (BASS), BRANDON BURKE (DRUMS), AND BRANDON BUCKLEY (GUITAR) HAD A DEFINITE IDEA AND FOCUS FROM DAY ONE. IT WAS TO BE THE MOST VERSATILE METAL BAND IN CENTRAL WA. AFTER MONTHS OF WRITING AND FINALIZING A HARDENED SOUND THAT HAS BECOME THEIR SIGNATURE, THE BAND RECRUITED ANOTHER GUITAR PLAYER, ED MEJIA.
       THE CHEMESTRY BETWEEN ED AND BUCKLEY WAS UNDENIABLE AND DATED BACK YEARS TO THEIR PREVIOUS ENDEAVOR IN DOWNSIZE. THE SOUND OF CHOKEOUT COULD BE COMPARED TO AN EXCAVATING CREW USING TEN TONS OF DINAMITE. GUT WRENCHING VOCALS, MACHINE GUN KICK DRUMMING, CHUGGING BASS LINES LIKE A LEAD PIPE, AND RAZOR TIGHT GUITARS THAT HAD A CHAINSAW LIKE BATTLE WITH THE CONSTANT BACK AND FORTH GUITAR SOLOS. 
      THE BAND HAS CHANGED SINCE DAY ONE, HOWEVER, THE MUSIC HAS STAYED THE SAME. ED MEJIA LEFT THE BAND TO FOCUS ON FAMILY IN 2007. ALTHOUGH THE BAND WENT ON TO OPEN FOR MANY NATIONAL ACTS AND WAS FINALIZING RECORDING SESSIONS FOR FLATLINE DRUMMER BRANDON BURKE LEFT THE BAND TO PLAY MUSIC IN AUSTIN TEXAS LATE 2008. 
      THE BAND FORGED ON AND HAD A VERY WELL RECIEVED AND PRAISED ALBUM THAT WAS SELF PRODUCED INTITLED FLATLINE. ALTHOUGH, THE ALBUM WAS GOOD, THE BAND WAS GROWING DARKER IN SPIRIT. FILLING THE VOID OF THE ORIGINAL LINEUP WAS HARDER THAN IT SEEMED. ONCE ALL COMMITMENTS FOR THE BAND WERE DONE FOR 2009, THE CREW REPLACED THE DRUMMER SEAT WITH UPAS DRUMMER, MIKE CLAYTON. 
      AS THE BAND EMBARKS ON 2010, THEY ARE CURRENTLY WRITING AND RECORDING FOR THE FOLLOW UP TO FLATLINE. THEY CONTINUE TO TAKE SHOWS IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST.
