Northeast Party House are a six piece alternative dance rock band from
Melbourne, Australia. In early 2010 the band began playing warehouse parties and local venues and quickly gained a following based on their reputation for delivering
high energy live shows.

A demo version of the band's track 'Dusk' gained blog attention and local airplay, eventually winning triple j's Unearthed competition and being invited to play at the Pyramid Rock Festival 2010.

In 2011 the band played alongside acts such as Does It Offend You, Yeah? (UK), The Go! Team (UK), Kimbra and Ball Park Music as well as finishing the year with a stand out set at Falls Festival.

The group released their debut EP through Stop Start/EMI in November 2011, featuring four tracks including single ‘Empires’ which was added to rotation on triple j.

Recorded over three months with engineer/producer Malcolm Besley in various beach houses, bedrooms and makeshift studios, the self-titled release showcases the band's unique mix of smooth lead vocals, intricate guitar hooks, atmospheric analog synth and driving party bass lines.
