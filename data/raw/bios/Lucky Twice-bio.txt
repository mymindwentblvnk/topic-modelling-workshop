Lucky Twice was a Swedish teenage pop duo consisting of nineteen year old Hannah Reynold and nineteen year old Emelie Schytz. They are signed to Family Tree Music in Sweden. Victoria Ekeberg is their manager who has a huge success with September, Gathania & Nexx.

Their first single "Lucky", was released in Spain on July 20, 2006 through Vale Music. It went to number 1 in the singles chart and was certified double platinum. Their album Young & Clever was released in June 2007 and was followed on July 23 by the single "Hop Non Stop".The song is a big storm in Vietnam

"Lucky" has also hit the charts in Denmark (# 5), France (# 8), Finland (# 17), Germany (# 41), Austria (# 42) and Sweden {# 43). Despite some video rotation, press interest and a performance at G-A-Y in London, the release of the CD single was cancelled in the United Kingdom after some record label complications. The song has reached a cult like status within U.K bars and nightclubs.

Originally Lucky Twice consisted of Hannah Reynold and Sofie Larsson. However, in 2007, Sofie Larsson left Lucky Twice to join the Twisters, a band she formed with her brother. Sofie was replaced by Emelie Schytz soon after, and Lucky Twice redid some of their songs with her. Sadly, in early 2010, Lucky Twice broke up and no longer exists. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lucky+Twice">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
