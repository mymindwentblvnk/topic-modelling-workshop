The Minas Gerais band “Calvary Death” returns in a brutal way to the metal scene, 15 years after the release of “Jesus, Intense Weeping” (1994). Founded in 1987, with the name of “Túmulo de Ferro” (Tomb of Iron), was one of the first up-country bands to achieve national prominence. In 1991 the name was changed to Calvary Death.

Their new stuff “Serpent”, brings the band true to its roots by making an old school death metal, playing with insane fury the soundtrack of the apocalypse. “Calvary Death” has a personal and unmistakable brand brilliantly exploited by the production of André Cabelo (Engenho Estúdio), and the artwork by Fernando Lima.

The whole theme of the album brings the dream vision in the “House of Betsaida”, the religious protest of “Antichrist”, the human reality finding of “Betrayer”, and lack of direction of the man in "World of Nobody", already a Brazilian Death Metal Classic.
