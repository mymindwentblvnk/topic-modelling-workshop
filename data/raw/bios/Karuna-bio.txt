There are two artist with this name:

1. Lara Karuna Vaidya is a pop artist who released Not 4 Sale as Karuna in 2008.

2. Karuna is a Finnish folk music trio with three keyboard players and a unique sound. The trio combines the sounds of the Swedish national instrument nyckelharpa (keyed fiddle) and accordion with the rich harmonies of piano and reed organ. Karuna's music is mostly composed by the pianist Juha Kujanpää, who creatively combines Nordic folk tradition with influences from baroque music, national romanticism and jazz. The musical language has been compared to Sibelius and the sounds of the Finnish forests. Esko Järvelä and Teija Niku represent the new generation of Finnish professional folk musicians. Their skills are matched by Kujanpää’s rhythmic playing and jazz background, resulting in fantastic music with many influences and harmonic twists.

Esko Järvelä: nyckelharpa, violin
Juha Kujanpää: piano, harmonium
Teija Niku: accordion
