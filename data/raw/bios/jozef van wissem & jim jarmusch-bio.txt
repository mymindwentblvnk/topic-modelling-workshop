Concerning The Entrance Into Eternity is an extraordinary collaboration between Dutch lutenist Jozef Van Wissem and American filmmaker & guitarist Jim Jarmusch. Jarmusch's previous collaborations with Wissem have not prepared the eager listener for the expressivity and emotional depth of his playing on these duets. Respectful of one another's space the pair weave layers of melody and waves of feedback while acoustic guitar and lute wrap together with a subtle depth expemplifying an austere understanding
and compatibility. Jarmusch's guitar work is metaphysical, at times sounding like a hurdy gurdy and at other time sounding as if it is responding to the calls of the lute.
The final piece, He Is Hanging By His Shiny Arms, His Heart An Open Wound WIth Love, finds Jarmusch accompanying a solo lute composition with a reading from St. John Of The Cross.
With three titles named after christian mystic Emanuel Swedenborg's work, this record is extraordinary, new and arcane at the same time, modern but timeless. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jozef+Van+Wissem+&+Jim+Jarmusch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
