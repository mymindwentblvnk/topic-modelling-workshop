Influenced by his mother and many great mc's like Jay-z, Outkast, UGK, and more Chuuwee blends the borders of underground, back pack hip hop and mainstream rap. During the first years of his career people tried discouraging him by saying music wasn't for him.

Chuuwee is becoming a well-known talent throughout Northern California.
