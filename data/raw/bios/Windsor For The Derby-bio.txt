Windsor for the Derby was formed in 1994 in Austin, Texas USA. Daniel Matz and Jason McNeeley are the core members of an ever shifting collaboration that has included their friends and family over the years.

Their first two CDs, Calm Hades Float and Minnie Greutzfeld, were released on Trance Syndicate Records and have recently been re-released on Secretly Canadian. Windsor For the Derby opened for Swans on its final US tour, and Michael Gira was so taken with their sound and performances that he immediately offered to release them on YGR.  Their last two records "We Fight til Death" and "Giving up the Ghost" have been released on Secretly Candian along with the re-issues.

They presently live in Philadelphia and will re-release a new full-length, "How We Lost" this year.

They are svelte and tanned.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Windsor+For+The+Derby">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
