11:34 was formed in early September 2004 by guitarist Bobby Jones and drummer Jonathan Martin. Soon thereafter, guitarist "Doubletokin'" Damian Barrett, as well as insane frontman "Metal" Mike Brewer were introduced to the band. The circle was complete after the rotating bassist spot was filled by Brandon Elswick. The visceral sound of 11:34 consists of a concoction of death metal, thrash and even southern rock, which in turn gives the band a truly unique style, much unlike the reoccuring sound of modern metal. http://www.myspace.com/eleventhirtyfour <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/11:34">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
