Singer/Songwriter/Sounddesigner & Author, based in Berlin/ Germany. 

Loewenhardt creates atmospheric songs, composes music and designs sounds for films, computer games and whatnot.
Releases can be found by the names of "velour chrome", "loe" and "Loewenhardt".
Using more and more natural instruments, he's joined by violinist and pianist Bat Batoschewski (das fieber) for (quite rare) live-appearances.
