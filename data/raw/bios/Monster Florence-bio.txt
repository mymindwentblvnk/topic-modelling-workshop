Monster Florence are a collective of rappers and musicians, combining their talents to create a sound that's unique, fresh, and undeniably British. The genre could be categorised as a hybrid of hip-hop, punk, with an influence of UK grime.
 
The group (Dream McLean, Alex Osiris, Wallace Rice, Tom Donovan, Cameron Morrell, Jonny Poole) released their debut EP 'The Groove' in early 2016, and have recently released their second EP, ‘Bad Gear’. The attention the band have received has already seen them support artists such as Gold Panda, Foreign Beggars and many more.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Monster+Florence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
