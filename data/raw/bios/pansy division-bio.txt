Pansy Division is a punk rock band formed in San Francisco, California in 1992. The band was a founding example of the queercore movement of openly gay musicians. They opened for fellow Bay Area band and former Lookout! Records artists Green Day on their "Dookie" tour in 1994 for a few months.

Their first single release was on the Outpunk Records compilation Outpunk Dance Party, to which they contributed the song "I Can't Sleep". They have released many singles and LPs, mainly on the independent record label Lookout! Records and on Alternative Tentacles.
