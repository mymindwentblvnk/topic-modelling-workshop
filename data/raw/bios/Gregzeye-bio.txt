Gregzeye was formed in June 2004 in Kutina / Croatia. Bands first lineup was Adi on guitar, Mile on vocals, Dac on bass and Veka on drums. We named the band after our friend Greg who came to one of our rehearsals after apparently hurting his eye on a beach umbrella. What better way to name your band than after your friends red eye?

At first we made 10 songs but didn't get a chance to record them, soon after that we parted ways with Dac.
Thanks to Dac for a good time. He will always be a good friend.

We played without a bass player for some time until we finally found Che. Toma≈æ was also recruited for solo guitar. They added quite a punch to our music as well as quality. Now our music evolved even more due to them listening to other metal genres.

We recorded a 5 song demo. On 28th of March 2005 we finally finished the demo. Then it was Veka's turn to part ways with us. so drumerless we made a break until Brane joined the team. We had only one concert with him then we parted ways with him aswell.After a one year break we were contacted by Alen (ex-Cydocore, also playing drums in Moltencore) and we we're ready to start again.
