British pop group founded in 1973, featuring Phil Pickett, Georg Kajanus, Henry Marsh and Grant Serpell. The band was still performing in 2007, albeit with personnel changes.

The group's musical line-up incorporates such diverse instruments as mandolins, glockenspiels, accordion, military bass-drum, and the legendary Nickelodeon, an extraordinary instrument designed and built for the purpose of delivering Sailor's definitive sound.

Their first album, released in 1974, included the hit "Traffic Jam". The album achieved Gold status in Holland. But it was the second album "Trouble" that established Sailor throughout the world. "A Glass of Champagne" was a massive hit throughout the world in 1975, followed by "Girls Girls Girls" in 1976.

The original line-up changed regularly from the end of the 1970s. In 1980 Phil and Henry released a new album together with Gavin David and Virginia David. In 1989 a new album was released after a ten year silence, featuring two singles "The Secretary" and "La Cumbia", so after a long gap they went back on tour again. In 1995 Georg Kajanus departed the band to pursue a solo career, leading to the introduction of Peter Lincoln, a respected guitarist and singer. Original member Henry Marsh left the band in late 1999, to be replaced by Anthony England. He was replaced in turn by Rob Alderton in 2001.

In 2004 Sailor were voted the 45th most successful pop band of the last 40 years in Germany.

In July 2005 Rob Alderton departed, but a few weeks later, original member Henry Marsh returned to his place at the Nickelodeon. In 2006 Peter Lincoln decided to leave after ten years to join The Sweet. Afterwards, Henry's son Oliver Marsh joined the band as their new singer to continue the journey... <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sailor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
