Roger Eugene Eno was born in Woodbridge, England in 1959. He is known primarily as an ambient composer.

He began euphonium lessons at twelve and at sixteen entered Colchester College to study music. On graduating and after a period of busking in London he returned to Colchester to run a music therapy course at a local hospital for the mentally handicapped.

His first recording experience was with his brother Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois for the album Apollo at Lanois' Grant Avenue Studios in Canada. His first solo album Voices appeared shortly afterwards.

Although mainly regarded as a pianist, Roger Eno is in fact a multi-instrumentalist and keen singer as demonstrated on his later solo albums and collaborations. He has worked with several key artists apart from his brother including Bill Nelson, No-Man, Lol Hammond, Peter Hammill, Tim Bowness and Michael Brook, the most successful of which was probably his co-written album The Familiar with Kate St John.

Roger performs live on occasion and continues to write soundtracks. Much of his music has been used in films including Nine and a Half Weeks, Warm Summer Rain and The Jacket while his tracks have been used in advertisements including Nissan and Japan Railways.

Roger has recently recorded solo albums for, and established an online shop via, the highly regarded UK-based internet label, Burning Shed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Roger+Eno">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
