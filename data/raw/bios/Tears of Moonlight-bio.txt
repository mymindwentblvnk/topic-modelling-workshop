Tears Of Moonlight is a Melodic Black Metal band from Colombia. Although they are often referred to as Dark Metal and Gothic Metal, the sound generally combines a Melodic sound with clean female vocal interludes. The themes are based off of contemporary Gothic cultures, some of which include; Melancholy, Sadness and Love.

They were formed in 2001 under a small, but successful record label in United Kingdom called Ram Records. The record label was mostly for Drum and Bass artists but, Tears Of Moonlight had become a small band apart of the label. 

In 2007 they released a demo entitled "Tears of Moonlight", which featured four songs and a Gothic-like album cover. During the year, they also released a single called "Sempiterno". This too, was a small single - only featuring two songs. 

After, undergoing small lineup changes the band decided to 'give up' and has separated. They have only left us off with six songs and have become an obscure band, yet to have been known. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tears+Of+Moonlight">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
