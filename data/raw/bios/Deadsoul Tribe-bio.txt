Deadsoul Tribe was founded in 2000 by Devon Graves (Buddy Lackey), former vocalist of Psychotic Waltz. 
In Deadsoul Tribe Graves serves as the principal songwriter, lead vocalist and guitarist as well as the producer on all of its releases. The remainder of the band consists of Adel Moustafa on drums and Roland Ivenz on bass, with Roland "Rollz" Kerschbaumer, who joined the band in 2002, providing additional guitarwork. The band's sound is characterized by heavy usage of tribal rhythms, dark atmospherics and unusual time signatures. Several Deadsoul Tribe tracks, such as "Black Smoke and Mirrors" on A Murder of Crows and "Toy Rockets" on The January Tree feature Devon Graves on flute, an instrument he picked up largely due to his admiration for Jethro Tull mainman Ian Anderson.

The band's fifth studio album, A Lullaby for the Devil, was released on September 11, 2007.
