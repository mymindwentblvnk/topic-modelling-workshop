Satori Junk was born in Milan (Italy) among the dense fog and the smoke of the urban waste landfills. An acid cocktail full of fuzz and electronics. 
Rough sounds, repetitive and loud overwhelming riffs and lyrics coming from dreams, hangover nightmares and horror movie atmospheres. The band's main idea is to trap the listener in their rabid and uncomfortable distorted world.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Satori+Junk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
