Genocya are a Lansing, Michgan Metal band that take their love of old school Thrash, Death, Black Metal, and various other genres of Metal and mix them all together in a sound that can only be described as their own. They create music for the sake of creating music and have fun while doing it. Since forming in 2002, they have been through line up changes that would have made lesser determined bands fall apart. One constant has always rang true...play Metal without worrying about it's "cool" or not. The band recently recorded their new CD, "Ever Descent" in Lansing with Sean "Xaphan" Peters(Wastelander/ex-Summon). It was mastered at Flatline Audio by Dave Otero and will be release this winter.
