It was the mid-‘90s, the heyday of techno in Munich- Riem, home to the Optimal and other legendary clubs, when Daniel Bortz stepped into the never-ending, untiring loop of the stoically pumping bass drum. He was born in Berlin in 1981, but shortly thereafter his family moved to Bavaria,where he grew up.

For the last 13 years he has been forging his deep beats, grooves and tracks for the club world from his base of operations in Augsburg. And it‘s precisely that club world that Bortz has been gracing with his releases for quite some time now, aiming right for its hypecravingg-spot. He got his training as a producer with the Munich label Pastamusik with whom he released his first recording 2007. Since then, he‘s been refining his sound between crate digging, house-nostalgia, dancefloor- transfer, sample insanity and a healthy dose of eclecticism.

Be it '80s new wave, '90s West Coast Hip Hop, Disco or Dance mania, Daniel Bortz brings things together that aren‘t bound up with realness and street credibility; he fuses his own world of sound for today‘s dance floor, and part of that is bootlegs – dangerously thin ice for a music producer’s reputation.

Daniel Bortz has an infallible knack for reducing things down to the nitty-gritty; to constantly limit elements to their bare minimum, even if nowadays "minimal" is considered an absolute no-no. But none of that bothers the Augsburg musician much; he is just as aware of his special status in the close-knit Bavarian scene as he is of the sceptical gloom-and-doom prophecies of Berlin’s music buffs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+Bortz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
