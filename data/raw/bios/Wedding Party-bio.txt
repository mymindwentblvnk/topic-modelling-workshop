Wedding Party was founded in 1992 by William J. Watters, Sheri Luckey Watters and Libby Luckey. Wedding Party, and their euro-gothic sound, became one of the leading acts in the newly arising Christian Goth scene. They've made several performances in the late 90's at Cornerstone Festival and released one album in 1998 titled "Anthems" (produced by Saviour Machine's "Eric Clayton"). Though it was their only release they gained a strong and loyal cult following. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wedding+Party">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
