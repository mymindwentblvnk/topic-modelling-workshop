Dagnir En Gwann was founded by Gortheb in december 2006. In Februar 2007 the first Demo "Unconventional Warfare" was released. "Vom Leben Und Krieg" started a new part of Dagnir En Gwann. All songs written after this song were full of emotions because of all that depressions and hate Gortheb went through.
In 2009 Arvagr joined the band and became session guitarist of Dagnir. Within the time Gortheb recognized that things worked out great so he made the decision to involve him as a full member. So since summer 2009 Dagnir En Gwann is a two member project.
From this time on, they started working on the first record. New songs were written and old ones got a facelift.
2011 they presented Faethor (Bass) and Otis (Drums) at their first gig with this line up @Stellwerk Bad Aibling.
In winter 2011 they released a demo called "Verloren". It contains 3 Songs. The first EP will be released at the 30.08.2013 and is self-titled "Dagnir En Gwann".
