Alternative rock band hailing from 3 corners(ish) of the UK - Swansea, Cheltenham & Chelmsford. 

Arfyn Rhys - Vox, Guitar. Phil Beastall - Drums. Ryan Kent - Bass.

We are The Revival.

Taking inspiration from most classic rock n roll bands, The Revival sound like a CLASSIC ROCK N ROLL BAND with great tunes and lovely melodies. Due to songwriter Arfyn Rhys' inability to play his instrument properly and learn more than 4 chords, there is nothing complicated about our music. Music does not need to be complicated. There should be more bands like us. There aren't. Unfortunately. We also try our hand at some delightful acoustic sounds - which completely works. Some might even say its our best material, I couldn't possibly say. What I will say is that Julian Clegg's ears are fucking massive, so make of that what you will. Sit back and enjoy the delights of The Revival - who are absolutely not a gospel christian band who shared the same name once upon a time.

The Revival are probably better than you.
