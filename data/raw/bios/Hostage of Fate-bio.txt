We are Achilles Karageorgiou and George Adamidis, two friends from highschool                                                                                                      set out to leave our mark on this sphere before our current existences fade to nothing.

We got hooked up in the intense and beyond amazing world of Metal somewhere around 2004.

Bands like Death, At the Gates, Metallica, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Kreator, Machine Head, Mastodon and countless others inspired us to follow the paths they led and join the world of creativity through voice, two guitars, a bass and a drum kit.

Around 2011, we started home recordings and in summer of 2012, we got in contact with Athanasios Karapanos (producer also of Necrorgasm and Winter’s Dawn among countless others) who mixed and mastered our debut album.

In fall of 2012 through the page of the Greek Death/Grind Scene (you ‘re more than welcome to join this page and discover lots of interesting music) we found Giannis Nakos (lungs of Mortal Torment & Procreate) who dressed our music with inspiring images.

5th of March 2013, we start our journey.

We want you to download our music, give it a full listen and enjoy it.

From now on we will continue to compose and write music as long as our minds and hands will be able to. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hostage+of+Fate">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
