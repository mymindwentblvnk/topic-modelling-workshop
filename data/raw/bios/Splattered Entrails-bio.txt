Begun in 2004 as a one-man side-project, has undergone many lineup changes over the past. Back to a one-man project, Splattered Entrails has established its name in the game as a project of Mike O'Hara (Malodorous & Cordectomy) that allows him to record whatever death metal is on his mind outside of Malodorous or Cordectomy. The inclusion of a drum machine allows for the never-ending possibilities of punishing death metal, however, always allowing the utter brutality to seep through.

Splattered Entrails, hitting the 'reset button' (YET AGAIN) is focusing on being a one-man project, delivering all the painful, punishing, tragic and disgusting mixtures of death metal into one unstoppable conglomeration.

Now, in 2011, Splattered Entrails will be releasing a 10-track EP 'Nauseate'. The track "Humans: Deprogrammed" will appear on there, as well as 9 other tracks. A tracklisting will be up soon.
