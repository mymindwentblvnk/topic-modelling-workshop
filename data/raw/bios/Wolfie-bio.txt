Wolfie is a band from Champaign, IL. Consisting of Joe and Amanda Ziemba, Mike Downey and RJ Porter, they rock pop to a different level. Pick up any of their many CD's and if you enjoy this check out Amanda and Joe's husband and wife duo, The Like Young, an amazing, but retired, Chicago Indie rock duet. Fans of the Like Young be warned, with the exception of 'Tall Dark Hill,' their sound is pretty different than what you're used to.

Wolfie members also formed Busytoby, Mathlete, National Splits. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wolfie">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
