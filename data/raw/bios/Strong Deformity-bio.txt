Strong Deformity started in 1996 as a progressive metal band. Their first album Power of Pain... was released in both Hungarian and English language versions. The release was followed by a 20+ stage tour around Hungary and Austria.

In 1999 Fekete Károly replaces Bíró Tamás as lead vocalist, and brings some melodic tones to the band's already flawless modern metal sounding. The next album Racket is released in 19 European countries, Superdope from this album even hit a US underground magazine.

2001 is the year of the Magic Syrup. After a demo album they made with the help of Anima Sound System members Prieger Zsolt and Németh Gergő, the band is given the opportunity to record the new album in Aquarium Studios, in contract with Warner Music Hungary. They gain even more respect home and abroad by this and the Imaginary Adventures video, directed by Oláh István.

After 3 years of intermission the band is working again. Their new album is expected in the fall of 2007.
