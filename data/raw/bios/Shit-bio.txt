There's at least three bands called Shit.

1) Mexican black/death/punk band whose lyric themes are Misanthropy and the Apocalypse. They have self-released En La Penumbra (demo, 2009), Apocalyptic Rage (full length, 2010), and World Suicide (demo, 2012). They are currently signed to Chaos records and their label debut Scavengers Of A Dying Sun (full length, 2015) will be released in June.

The band started out as a one-man project by Mackoy Uribe in Tecate, Mexico when the "...En La Penumbra" demo tape was recorded on October 1st, 2009 . The tape was well-received in the San Diego/Tijuana/Tecate area, which inspired the project to be supported by a live band. To the ShitCult were added long-time friend and former bandmate Samuel Townsley (ex-Man Destroys Himself, Condemned, Parasitic) on Vocals, Panchies Cruz - Guitar, Brian Paredes - Guitar, Zinky Hernandez - Bass (all from San Diego Ca). The newly formed lineup played many shows in cities all over Mexico and USA. The first proper full-length followed soon after. "Apocalyptic Rage" was set for release via Grind & Destroy Records, but due to label troubles was shelved. After a few member changes and border crossing issues; Isaac Vargas a local troubadour from Tecate Mexico joined on guitars, and the "World Suicide" demo was recorded, showcasing even more apocalyptic black metal/Crust sound. The band still needed a lead guitarist, which is when former band mate Noel Bello (ex-Man Destroys Himself, Ninth Level, and some other bands not worthy of mention) joined the ShitCult. Vargas' riffing and Belloâ€™s vision combined to create a more complex song structure and darker atmosphere to Shit. The final element was added with Carlos Escobar (ex-Omision) on Bass, and a more metallic and "sophisticated" sound was fleshed out, staying true to SHIT's tenets and philosophical bent since the very beginning - apocalypse, misanthropy, chaos, fatalism and darkness!!!

SHIT has developed a unique and chaotic sound; be prepared for their first full-length album "Scavengers of a Dying Sun" Via Chaos Records, Recorded and Mixed in Tijuana Mx By: Melchor Felix, Mastered in Munich Germany By: Michael Zech (Secrets of the moon,Ascension). Artwork handled By: Count Sebastian Bloodcastle and Daniel Corchado (The Chasm ex-Incantation.

Statement:
"We are shit. We wail, we moan, we make a racket and the old folk tell us to keep the noise down. We tackle the deep divisions in the world and intellectually consider in our music Ham,Aids,Pornography,Train Crashes, Broom Abuse and MMORPG Gaming. 

Nothing short of shambolic live comedic chaos. Ft.Bert Burnell, Richard Norman, Craig Gray and Bob Fletcher."
