The Bevis Frond is a British musical group whose range covers hard edge to melancholy vintage indie rock to poetic, "classic-rock" songcraft with a thick Walthamstow accent. Nick Saloman is the band's frontman and songwriter. They have recorded many albums out on various independent labels.

Saloman was originally in a band known as the Bevis Frond Museum in the late 1960s and in 1979 was in a band called the Von Trapp Family. The Bevis Frond, however, was a one man band from the start with the release of a 250 copy pressing of Miasma in 1987. Saloman's desire was to "record the kind of music I'd like to listen to...I wanted a Hendrix/Wipers, Byrds sound but with a distinctly British feel." Subsequent albums were also recorded in a home studio until after the release of his sixth album, Any Gas Faster, when he began to record in an outside studio. This is also the point that he began touring. Another 1990 album, Magic Eye, was a collaboration with Twink of the Pink Fairies.

Early albums were usually entirely recorded by Saloman although most later albums have been recorded by the current touring band. For performances, The Bevis Frond usually has Adrian "Ade" Shaw on bass. Bevis Frond material is typically released on Saloman's own Woronzow Records label, and is frequently featured in the Ptolemaic Terrascope magazine and accompanying records/CDs. The Bevis Frond also record with and write much of the material for US singer Mary Lou Lord. The song "Lights Are Changing" was chosen for inclusion on Children of Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the Second Psychedelic Era, 1976-1995.
