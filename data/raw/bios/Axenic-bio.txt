Axenic was formed in early 1994 in Atlanta, GA - by founding member Ji Taylor (Guitar) He recruited Treavor Hale (Drums) and Zech Benham (Vocals). Several songs were written and recorded, but never officially released. In mid 1997 Treavor left the band in pursuit of other music avenues, leaving Axenic in search of a new drummer. The surviving members then picked up Adam Gagnon (Bass) and Douglass Ferguson (Drums) and charted a new course. Practicing heavily for 1 year, they created a unique take on Extreme Metal music, in preperation for an assault on the Atlanta underground scene. In early 1999 Axenic entered the recording studio in Atlanta to record their first official demo tape "Reaping Mindless Discord" featuring 5 tracks. Multiple live gigs were to follow in support of their new demo. Playing shows, with many touring and local Atlanta bands. Late 1999 saw Axenic going back into the studio with Matt Washburn at Ledbelly Sound, to record their follow up CD release "Eruption of Time" featuring 3 tracks. Axenic's music was featured multiple times on Atlanta colledge radio WREK weekly friday night metal show "WREKage". Axenic then entered Ledbelly studios again to record their next release but disbanded before it was completed in late 2000. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Axenic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
