Stabwound is a brutal death metal band from Gothenburg, Sweden.  No, they did not have the Gothenburg sound at all (despite the fact that they were a death metal band from Gothenburg).  They released their debut EP Bloodsoaked Serenades in 2002 and followed it up with a full-length album in 2004 called Human Boundaries.  Stabwound has been inactive since 2006.  Their last known lineup consisted of Per Ahre (vocals, guitar),  Fredrik Linfjard (guitar, bass, vocals),  Mikka HÃ¤kki (bass) and  Viktor Linder (drums). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stabwound">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
