5. A rock band from Sydney, Nova Scotia

6. A Hard Rock band from D/FW. Comprised of veterans in the Dallas music scene. Featuring ex-members of the defunct North Texas mod-rock outfits Lift, Reverent, Trial X Stone, and Eerie Ln with huge guitars giving way to verses driven by monster rhythms and, during the choruses, walls of sound, everything tight and occasionally thrashy. The hooks are powerful, the vocals meaningful and the performances memorable.

7. From New Haven, Connecticut, The Pulse evolved out of The Bram Rigg Set and The Shags, and were originally known as The Pulse Of Burritt Bradley. The track, Burritt Bradley, is a surreal slice of psychedelic madness, which can also be found on the Beyond The Calico Wall (LP & CD) compilation. By contrast, their album is a furious heavy rock affair and rated highly by some collectors. Tommy Violante left in 1969, although the band soldiered on until '72, playing mostly rehashed Cream-type stuff."
