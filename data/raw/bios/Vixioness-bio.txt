Vixioness is a one man band. Created by Frank Vega. All instruments, vocals, recording, mixing and production by Frank Vega. 

The Fallen is the NEW release by Black Metal's New Force, Vixioness. It is Black Metal the way it should be, raw, dark, in your face, above all...TRUE. The album contains seven tracks. Within each track, you can listen and feel, Frank Vega's emotions and restlessness to destroy all that it is fake. A very dark album, from an even more darkened soul.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/vixioness">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
