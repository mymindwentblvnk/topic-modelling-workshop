Australian grindcore band, formed in May 2000 by Tom Raetz (bass), Dave Hill (guitars/drum programming) and Jay Jones, all of whom were former members of Open Wound and Arseripper. The band were initially named Fuck...I'm Dead, but the ellipsis was dropped from their name in 2009 when the band's logo was redesigned.

The band formerly performed live using a drum machine. In mid-2007, they announced they were experimenting with a live drummer. Soon after, Darren Condy filled in on drum duties. Although originally meant as a session drummer for live shows, Darren was later enlisted as a full-time member and recorded on the band's second full-length, Another Gory Mess.

Jack Whitcroft (Die Pigeon Die, Doubled Over) was the band's bassist in 2008-2012 during Tom Raetz's absence. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Fuck+I%27m+dead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
