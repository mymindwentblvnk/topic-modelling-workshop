Advent started as a Melodic Metal project, leadered by Luis and Roberto. Rehearsing with similar musicians and then meeting Daniel who originally joined the band as a keyboard player, later he changed its position to guitars sharing musical ideas with the band. .. .. Through all these years the band has suffered changes on its lineup, starting to write its own music under a mix of influences that goes from the Melodic Death Metal, to Progressive and Ambiental Music. Along shows Whisper, Hopeless, On Darkness and Expecting The Ashes of Wind were created, Until Advent was consolidated together with Margil on Bass Guitar and then working with Sfinge Studios on recording “Sounds From Within”, our first ep. .. .. Recently Advent signed with Asenath Records for the release of this album, which will be distributed locally, nationwide and throughout the world; the band has been working on new material, that will be shown on upcoming gigs. .. .. Advent wants to thank every one of you who have believed in us since the beginning of this journey... now our passion. .. .. And you for keeping this dream real. Thanks for the support!!
