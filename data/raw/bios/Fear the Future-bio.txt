Fear the Future was formed in late 2002, in Nässjö Sweden with the goal of making harsh and aggressive metal drawing influences from both the scandinavian and international metal legacy.

The first recording took place in early September 2003. A 3-day studio session spawned the DEMO 1: 2003. Released mainly through the Internet and in only 100 copies on CD. To date the tracks of the demo has been downloadad almost 12000 times, a quite astounding figure. After the release drummer Viper parted ways with the band and was replaced by Spawn.

In early January 2004 dutch label NEW AEON MEDIA, sublabel to KARMAGEDDON MEDIA, got in touch and offered FEAR the FUTURE a deal for the release of a CD. The band accepted and expanded the line-up with bassist Azazel. The album entitled "The bloody beginning" was recorded in Studio Sunlight with Tomas Skogsberg. The recording went well but the mixing took forever leaving the band frustrated. In early 2005 producer PNA from Cavern Studio in Stockholm was contacted and took on the task of finnishing the production and did so during spring. Later on Karmageddon Media backed out and everything looked bad. But in early 2006 a new record company called "Ninth Gate "Records" wanted to release it and the band signed a new contract. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fear+the+Future">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
