Started in the summer of 2011 with the goal of creating something self fulfilling. Not long after a rehearsal on tape was released which has since been sold out. In support of the rehearsal shows where played in San Diego, Los Angels, and Las Vegas. By early 2012 they had manage to assemble a full line-up ad re-recorded a song of the rehearsal as a promo. Sadly by the spring of 2014 Lisa and Carlos where left to continue as a two piece. June 2014 the demo The Ruins of our Servitude was released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ruminations">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
