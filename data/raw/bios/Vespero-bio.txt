Formed in Astrakhan, Russian Federation band VESPERO (ex-Веспер) began in early 2003 as all instrumental quartet of bassist/keyboardist Arkady Fedotov, violinist Valentin Rulev, percussionist/drummer Ivan Fedotov, and guitarist Alexander Kuzovlev who were brought together by common interest in spontaneous improvisations and psychedelic-fueled music. In the next few months, the line-up grew to include a female vocalist, with the final addition of Natalya Tjurina, and Arkady Fedotov taking male vocalist duties. In 2004-2006, VESPERO endured several personnel changes, produced a number of self-made recordings featuring Alexei Klabukov on keyboards... and gradually shifted away from the acid-jamming and kraut-rock style to embrace a more prog-rock oriented approach to music drawing inspiration from the avant-garde poetry and theatre-art.
