The sound of strong winds driving the melody,
Thunder screaming as a lullaby - shine.
The splendor of the moon glowing - clear.
Astral travelling,
Upward path...
In this ambient and atmospheric environment - The insanity is awake!
The face of madness is finally revealed, with hypnagogic hallucinations.
In a catharsis - psychocultural ethos of an era; antichristian manifest - the way of spiritual endorphin and vendetta.
An ambient / atmospheric Black Metal unhealthy and sick.
Iis designed COLD BLASPHEMY horde. 

Cold Blasphemy bringing antidotes to the wounds, cancer, the ulcers and mental sterility that was injected into your veins.



Members of The Horde Cold Blasphemy

A compound psychoactive and dysfunctional;
A combination of simultaneous tones so out of harmony and dissonant, which comes to be incomprehensible and unintelligible reason of this union.

Gr√§fin Blutbad (Aka Countess / Condessa Carnage)
Performs the psychosomatic
Your noological mind procreate the atonic, disturbed and incomprehensible steric screammers and lyrical reverie.

Krieglord
Performs the Psychomotor
Vertigo, stupor and sublimated ambient sounds and all the instrumental part is carried out by the same sick and diatonic form.
