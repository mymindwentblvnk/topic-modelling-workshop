Coliseum formed in November of 2003 and has since toured and recorded with relentless abandon for the better part of a decade. They issued a self-titled debut album on Level Plane in 2004, followed by the Goddamage EP in 2005, and their second album No Salvation on Relapse Records in 2007. The band has been on countless tours across North America, Europe, Australia and Japan, with Converge, Rise Against, High On Fire, Mono, Napalm Death, Baroness, Russian Circles, Torche, Integrity, and many others. Coliseum joined the Temporary Residence Limited roster in 2010 with the release of their third long-player, House With A Curse, and a deluxe reissue of the their Goddamage EP on TRL followed soon after. Members also play in Black God, Legion, Yautja, and Central Fires.
