The band,originally formed as Loosin'O'Frequencies(which released in 1999 a mcd produced by Doom Guru Paul Chain), was born from Alessandro"Drughito" Santori and Roberto Malerba, After sessioning many musicians and haven't found a suitable voice in 2004, both the guys decided to turn the band into instrumental and change the name in L'ira del Baccano. Once the vocal search was over, the guys found Sandro"Fred" Salvi and Massimo"Max"Siravo to fill the line up and meet doom influences, 60'70's psychedelia and the performing freedom of jam bands such as Grateful Dead. The resulting long tracks, in constant evolution and movement, fund every song on a solid base and open seasons for improvisation. Each song is recognisable but will display unique colours. The stage is the best site to express l'Ira Del Baccano's music. Every song was in fact recorded live. On stage, L'ira del Baccano play all their music masses aiming to bring the public to a new trip, at every concert. In summer 08 the band release their first album "Si non sedes is...Live"..56 minutes of live performance..the album is available in FREE download from the official site WWW.IRADELBACCANO.IT  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/L%27Ira+del+Baccano">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
