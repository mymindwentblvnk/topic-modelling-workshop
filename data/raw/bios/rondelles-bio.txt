The Rondelles are an indiepop band originally from Albuquerque, New Mexico. The band, which formed when the three members were still in high school (1996), originally consisted of Juliet Swango on guitar and vocals, Yukiko Moynihan on bass, and Oakley Munson on drums and keyboard. At live shows Oakley was known to play the drums standing up while hitting the keyboard with his drum stick. While living in Albuquerque, the three members of the Rondelles were also three-quarters of the final lineup of local sci-fi-themed pop-punk act LuxoChamp, behind singer-guitarist Brad Beshaw. The band later moved to Washington, D.C. (2001) and has since disbanded. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Rondelles">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
