The Samhain is a Bolivian progressive metal band.

The band was originally formed by Luis Fernando Jordán ("Luigi") and Gustavo Loyola ("Chavo") in the guitars, Sergio López ("Paco") in the bass, Jaime Equivar in the drums, and Guillermo Roca in the vocals. After a short while, the drummer Jaime had to leave the band, and is replaced by Sergio Durán ("Duro"), who shows a great ability in playing the drums.

However, shortly after Duro replaced Jaime, there had to be yet another change in the band. Hugo Arce replaces Duro and it's here where the band finally takes flight, thanks to Hugo's will to work in the band's development.

The band started playing covers of popular power and progressive metal bands, such as Helloween and Angra. Eventually, the band members start working in their own songs, based mainly in Power and Progressive Metal.

In 2006, the band manages to record a demo with some original tracks, although this debut album never reached the market.

During 2007, the band starts playing on gigs in Bolivia, specially in La Paz and other cities such as Sucre and Oruro. Guillermo Roca leaves the band because he wanted to lead a completely different lifestyle. Because of that, the band had to get invited guests as vocalists in gigs, to the point that in one of the gigs they counted with help from Valhalla's vocalist. Milan Espinoza, who has been in other local bands, replaces Guillermo officially.

On July 1st, 2008, the band enters the studio to record their debut album. This album was released on 2009, and it counts officially with 7 tracks. The album's name is "Revelations Of A Dream". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Samhain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
