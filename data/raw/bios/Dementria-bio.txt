Established in 2013 in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland, post-black metal influenced by genres from jazz and neoclassical music to death metal.
Created to seduce and hypnotize you and with one of a kind sound take you in the journey from scandinavian fjords, through frozen plains of Syberia, to the darkest corners of your mind.
The EP 'Atrocity of light' presents preview of upcoming works.
