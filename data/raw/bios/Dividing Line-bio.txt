The swiss rock band DividingLine exists since autumn 2001. The band plays their own songs, composed by the founder and singer of the band Reto Frischknecht. The additional notation "happy dark rock with a touch of gothic ..." indicates the difficulty to designate the style of the group since they play a wide variety of different songs. Main influences come from Saviour Machine and Pain of Salvation but also from one of the first christian rock bands Petra

In autumn 2005 the band released the first recording which contains six tracks. This low budget release helped promoting the band. DividingLine has concerts since throughout switzerland. More information can be found at the band's official website (only in german). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Dividing+Line">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
