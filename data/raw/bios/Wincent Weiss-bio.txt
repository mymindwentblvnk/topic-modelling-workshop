Wincent Weiss (born 21 January 1993 in Eutin, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany) is a German singer-songwriter. 

He first rose to prominence in Germany when he took part in the casting show Deutschland sucht den Superstar in 2013. After uploading several covers on Youtube, the German DJ duo “Gestört aber Geil” released a remix of one of his covers of “Unter meiner Haut” which reached a top position of number six on the German Singles Chart in 2015.

His first solo single “Regenbogen”, which was released in 2015, failed to chart in Germany but his second single “Musik sein” was a major success in the German-speaking countries of Europe. The same happened to his follow-up “Feuerwerk” which entered the top thirty in Germany and Switzerland. 

He released his debut album “Irgendwas gegen die Stille” in 2017 which peaked at number three in Germany. His second studio album was released two years later, in 2019 and included the successful single “An Wunder”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wincent+Weiss">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
