Armen Miran's love and passion for electronic music genres started at a very young age; spending the majority of his time at underground music scenes. His biggest influences include - Pink Floyd, Klaus Schuze, Pete Namlook, Depeche Mode and Eloy to name a few.

In 2006, Armen began his journey producing electronic ambient and dark techno sounds. Fast forward to 6 years later, he was booked for his very first gig at Armenia's well known underground venue called Calument, where he left the crowd speechless with his ambient/Armenian electronic folk and deep house tunes.
