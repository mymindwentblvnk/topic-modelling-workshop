Aethyr were created on May 30, 2007 by Major & Lord Mephisto Draven. Now after some years of idleness, the debut album is in its final stage; hopefully to be released soon.

Aethyr is an experimental project, led by Major. The first full length album had been recorded in 2008, but remained within the archives of Last Candle Workshop until recently that work started again so that it may be released sooner than later. Aethyr is active, and much work has been done regarding the album to follow this upcoming release.


2. Aethyr (Russia) Funeral/ Drone / Metal

Little is known about the secretive duo named AETHYR, aside from the fact that Mr.D and Mr.W are aliasing names of well-known professional artists who live and work somewhere in between Russia and Western Europe. One of them is a gifted musician who plays in various music bands, and the other is an acclaimed graphic and visual designer. Their self-described “heavy-drone ritual” musical voyage was presented to the world via the group’s 2009 “Mass” EP available on “Dirgenera Quadrivium MMIX” split-release. AETHYR’s basic approach – heavy-droning distorted guitars, rasping vintage synthesizers, programmed metallic percussions, noisy feedback, and other sound effects – was laid down on their consequent recordings and revealed an ambition to create a punishing of black and doom metal, dark ambient and harsh industrial elements.
