WNDR might still be unknown to the mainstream, but do not make the mistake of associating him with your typical up-and-coming producer. At just 27 years of age the Oslo-native has already put in a decade of work and gained a rep for himself in the club scene of his hometown, landed Top 10 tracks in Ireland and toured heavily in Europe. When his previous single Medicine was playlisted on Norwegian P3 he did not regard it as a breakthrough, but more of a deserved acknowledgement from the home crowd.

Over the last couple of years, he has carved out his own space filled with heavy 808 drum patterns, intuitive bass lines and unique chord progressions. Fellow musicians and producers hold his artisanship in high esteem, You do not have to be a music geek to understand the emotions he is trying to communicate, though - they have already found a dedicated audience far beyond the Norwegian club scene.

For those who grew up with him there is no surprise WNDR turned out to be a musician. He had spent 10.000 hours in front of his DJ-set-up before he had turned 13. Before high school was over, he had spent an additional 10.000 hours on music production. Labelled a serious talent early on, he could very well have been a household name by now, but WNDR has stuck to his own vision, creating music solely on his own premises.
WNDR explains, «For me, it's about communicating emotions, connecting with people through headsets or speakers… and those emotions have to be sincere.» <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/WNDR">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
