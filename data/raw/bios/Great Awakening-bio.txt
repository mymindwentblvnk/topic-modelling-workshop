After spending the past year releasing new music with fans through a video series and intimate demo recordings, Great Awakening has begun releasing two new singles showcasing the band’s refined indie-pop sound.

“Margins” and “Restitution,” the band’s two latest singles, showcase duo Zach Janicello and Cole Johnson’s new work after taking a nearly three-year break to finish college, marry, and mature in their worldview and musical sound.

The pair picked back up writing and releasing new songs together in early 2014, an announcement met with much enthusiasm from new and longtime fans that enjoyed their previous albums “Songs and Secret” and “Cities,” which were recorded and produced by Elijah Moseley and released through Come&Live!

Realizing that often there is an unfortunate gap between creativity and songs of faith that resonate with believers, Great Awakening is writing the music they longed for years to hear.

Zach and Cole formed Great Awakening in 2008 as an outlet for worship music, with the venture seven years later stretching the pair to step outside the boxes of mainstream Christian music. Great Awakening is on a journey to create art about God, life, pain and faith.
