ABSTRACT RAPTURE WAS FOUNDED IN MAY 2001 BY DRITTT (VOCALS), NOL (GUITARS), STEVE E. (BASS) AND STEVE R. (DRUMS). DURING 9 MONTHS, ABSTRACT RAPTURE WROTE MANY SONGS IN ORDER TO PLAY CONCERTS IN LUXEMBOURG AND NEARBY SURROUNDINGS. THEIR FIRST GIG WAS IN ATHUS, BELGIUM, AT THE MARIGNAN. 

AS THE CRITICS WERE POSITIVE, THEY KEPT PLAYING CONCERTS WITH A FEW BANDS OF THE LUXEMBOURG SCENE. 

TWO YEARS LATER, THEY STARTED RECORDING THEIR FIRST DEMO CALLED ASPHYXIATION. THOUGH THE SOUND WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY (THE CD WAS RECORDED IN THE CELLAR WHERE THEY REHEARSED) IT SOLD VERY WELL AND GAVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO ORGANIZE MORE GIGS. 

TOWARDS THE END OF MAY 2003, STEVE E. AND STEVE R. DECIDED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. THEN ROL JOINED THE BAND AS BASS PLAYER. SPIT ARRIVED ONLY AT THE END OF DECEMBER THAT YEAR. HOWEVER, HIS STYLE IMMEDIATELY MATCHED WITH THE BAND AND ALREADY TWO WEEKS AFTER, THE « RAPTORS » PLAYED THEIR FIRST CONCERT AT THE ROX BAR IN THE GRUND, LUXEMBOURG. THE BAR GOT OVERCROWDED AND THE PEOPLE REALLY SEEMED TO APPRECIATE THE STUFF THEY HEARD. 

MANY CONCERTS FOLLOWED THIS FIRST ONE, AND STEP BY STEP, ABSTRACT RAPTURE BECAME WELL-KNOWN IN THE METAL SCENE OF LUXEMBOURG. DURING 2004 THEY PLAYED A LOT OF GIGS, WHICH CONFIRMED THEIR IRON WILL AND THEIR DETERMINATION FOR PLAYING METAL. 

IN JULY 2005, THEY ENTERED THE TIDAL WAVE STUDIOS IN KARLSRUHE, GERMANY, TO RECORD THEIR NEW EP, DEAD END ENTRY. THE RELEASE OF THIS 5 TRACK CD IS PROGRAMMED FOR THE END OF DECEMBER 2005. 

MEANWHILE, YOGY, THE GUITAR PLAYER OF THE BAND SCARRED JOINED ABSTRACT RAPTURE AS FULL-TIME LEAD AND RHYTHM GUITAR, TO SUPPORT NOL AND TO BRING NEW INFLUENCES IN THE BAND.
