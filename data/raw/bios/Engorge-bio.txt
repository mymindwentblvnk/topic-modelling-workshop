There are 2 bands called Engorge, one from the Netherlands and one from the United States.

The Dutch Engorge was formed in 1994 in Nieuwegein, the Netherlands. The band plays Old school Death metal, mid-paced, low-tuned and groovy. After a demo ('Struggle of Death', released in 1996), the first full-length 'Awaiting to Subside' was released in 1999. After the release the band played many shows throughout the Netherlands. After a period of rest, the second full-length album '50 Megatons of Armoured Steel' was released in 2003, a concept album about German warship the Bismarck.

Over the course of 2008, 2009 and 2010 the band completed work on their third and final album 'Their Name Liveth For Evermore.' Once again a concept album, this time about a World War 1 theme: the Battle of Ypres. The album is scheduled for release somewhere in 2011. The band will then do a few gigs to celebrate the release of the album after which Engorge will forever be laid to rest...
