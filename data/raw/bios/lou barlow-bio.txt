Lou Barlow (born Louis Knox Barlow on July 17, 1966, in Dayton, Ohio) is an American alternative rock musician and songwriter. A founding member of the groups Deep Wound, Dinosaur Jr., Sebadoh, and The Folk Implosion, Barlow, from a base in Western Mass-Boston in 1982, is credited with helping to pioneer the lo-fi style of rock music in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Though born in Dayton, Ohio, Barlow was raised in Jackson, Michigan and then Westfield, Massachusetts. He is widely considered to be among the most prolific and ground-breaking indie musicians of the 1990's. He's best known for his work with Sebadoh, The Folk Implosion and Dinosaur Jr.'s original and current lineup. Many labels have been applied to his unique brand of acoustic rock, including lo-fi, folk-pop and folkcore.  Barlow's latest album, his second official solo effort under his own name, is titled Goodnight unknown. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lou+Barlow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
