2) Eternal Fire were founded in 1994 by Raduz , who was singing, writing lyrics and composig the music. At that time our sound was rather hard and metal. Lyrics were more private, straight, socially critical, but also spiritualy oriented and strong influenced by ancient India's philosophy, Hare Krishna's motion. The group was ebolished in 1995 and refounded in 2002 in a new formation: Raduz (bass-guitare, singer,lyrics,music), Honza Vrba (drums), Petr Lesniak "Forest" (1st guitare), Standa Hamouz (2nd guitare). Nowadays we are playing again in new formation. Drums have been occuped by Martin Bock "Boky"- very furious drummer:) and Forest has been supplied by new guitarist Tomas Danis. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eternal+Fire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
