Mennen is a Dutch hard-rock group founded by former Zinatra vocalist, Joss Mennen in summer of 1992.
 
The lyrics are written by Joss with a lot of variation. There are serious parts where they sing about actual themes of the world, like political problems or environment. The other side is about personal matters, love or just party. The compositions and arrangements are done by the whole band. Quite interesting for Mennen's melodic Hard-rock style is the combination of the two guitarists. Eric with his more sophisticated playing style and on the other hand P.P. whose playing is based on blues-rock riffs and licks.
 
Together with Joss's typical voice and the mighty backing vocals, these are the basic ingredients where Mennen stands for.
