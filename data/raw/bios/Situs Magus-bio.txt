Situs Magus appears to be an one-man project/band from France.
Avantgarde Music, his label, released this answer after asking him for info for the public.

“Under the sign of black,
I would grant the forces of the thrice great to guide my way through the Great Work.
I would cross through the essence of matter and spirit. By the grace of the four magical procedures:

L’oeuvre au Noir (nigredo)
L’oeuvre au Blanc (albedo)
L’oeuvre au Jaune (xanthosis)
L’oeuvre au Rouge (rubedo)

The work will be revealed in its purest form, uniting the irreconcilable to open celestial channels and drown in the astral light.”
