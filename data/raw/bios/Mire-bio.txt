2. MIRE is a metal band formed in 2017 by guitarists Ryan Glisan, Nick Hipa, and vocalist Benton McKibben. Known in part through their former endeavors, Hipa (As I Lay Dying/Wovenwar) and Glisan (Allegaeon/Pyrithion) set out to create a stylistically unrestrained endeavor based on a mutual admiration for riff based songwriting. Together with McKibben, MIRE combines creativity and technicality with an emotive focus at its core.

4. Frontier-free, kind of sensuous and just as chilled as necessary, Mireâ€™s music is just right for both hanging out with your crew and long lonely nights. Mire is originally from Canada and has lived in Ethiopia and Somaliland before he settled in the suburbs of Paris, France, where his unique genre-less music was born. The young singer has mostly been influenced by artists such as 6lack, Travis Scott and The Weeknd, but his ways of conceiving music know no boundaries. With vibes rooted in R&B, trap, and French rap, his sound is still in motion but the energy is all there already. You should press play.
