Black Marble is one of the latest and greatest additions to the Brooklyn synthwave lexicon.  Their stark, alienating textures cloister a vaguely hopeful intensity, like a lone and distant rhythm echoing from the hull of a lost deep sea vessel. Reminiscent of early DIY synth recordings, which pitted emotional undercurrents against wan dystopian landscapes, Black Marbleâ€™s sound struggles to squeeze blood from monolithic concrete.

Collaborators Ty Kube and Chris Stewart take their inspiration from a disparate group of past musicians who dared to mix punk ethics with cold electronics, resulting in an enigmatic, handmade style that recalls the isolated-but-uplifting feel of early European minimal and coldwave music.  Triumphantly bleak but undeniably infectious, Black Marble's debut EP Weight Against the Door arrives, appropriately, at the height of winter.
