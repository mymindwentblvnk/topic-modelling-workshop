Synkvervet started out as a one-man studio project by Iwan in the fall of 2011. The name means illusion and comes from the Old Norse sagas. Originally Synkvervet was supposed to be a pure instrumental project, but it didnâ€™t take long before he realized that the project needed vocals. Not being much of a vocalist, he called in Rogner of KIRKEBRANN and TROKLE, and together they created the mysterious, trollish and aggressive folk sound that is SYNKVERVET. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Synkvervet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
