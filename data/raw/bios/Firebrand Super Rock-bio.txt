Firebrand Super Rock play real Heavy Metal, drawing influence from the mountainous riffage of Sabbath and Purple and fusing it with the heavier sensibilities of more recent Metal. Laura Donnelly's sublime vocals lend a classic sound that fuses perfectly with the thunderous riffage coming from the band.

Their second album "Born for the Gallows" (produced by Chris Fielding - Primordial, Electric Wizard etc) is out now on Wasted State Records and has already gained critical acclaim from the UK and European press, with more on it's way. The band have supported the Likes of Slayer (at the Hammersmith Apollo), Mastodon, Electric Wizard and more in the past, as well as playing festivals such as Bloodstock and Hammerfest.

"Mournful Sabbath sounds and prog austerity give way to crunchy stoner grooves and delicate interludes, then culminate in emotive towering hard rock epics, with thrash shapes in between." - Terrorizer

"'Shadow of the Witch wouldn't be out of place on any classic NWOBHM album and 'Lost at Sea' is a slice of high musical drama." - Metal Hammer

"The gritty Scottish quartet are able to revive as few others can the magnificence of the purest and most classic heavy metal, with tough riffs, memorable melodies and great songs" - Rock Hard Italy
