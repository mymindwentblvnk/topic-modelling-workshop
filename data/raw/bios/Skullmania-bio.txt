Look out world - Skullmania has arrived.

Striving forward with a passion for all things Metal, Skullmania, whose founding members Amin and Nathan met in school, started out as a casual Punk-Rock outfit, never thinking that they would take it further than a by-the-way interest. When their guitarist left because of other commitments, Amin and Nate decided to take a break - to reflect, and "recuperate".

This move proved lucky for all Skullmania fans as it was during this time that they discovered the joy of Metal - it's hard, it's heavy, it's fast and it opened their eyes to lead them to do things with their music they never dreamed they could come up with.

Six months after continuously working on their music together, Dale arrived in his full, old-school Metalhead glory, and the band was pushed to greater heights.
So you mix these boys together, fuse in their raw, genuine music talent, and what do you get? You get Skullmania, and they're ready to bring Metal back, starting by conquering (where else?) this tiny island they call home; Singapore.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skullmania">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
