Axatak was formed in Melbourne in 1983. They play early style heavy metal/hard rock with a bit of glam imagery and lyrical themes, and were heavily influenced by KISS. After recording their "Sneak Attack" demo in 1984, they recieved a deal to record a full-length with Crunch Records, resulting in "Shock Rock" - their only ever full-length. After this they released a self titled EP in 1985, and have since vanished into obscurity.
