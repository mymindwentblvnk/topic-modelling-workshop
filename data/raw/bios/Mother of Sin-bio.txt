BIOGRAPHY

Mother of Sin is a heavy metal band from the north of Holland, formed around former Elegy and PrimeTime singer/guitarist Eduard Hovinga and former Vengeance drummer Gerry de Graaf. The combination of great instrumental skills, comlex songwriting and strong melodies, makes one think of a fusion between bands like Symphony-X, Cacophony, TNT and Masterplan. Shortly after the formation in 2003, the band recorded a demo cd. Because of the good reviews received in magazines and e-zines like Lords of Metal and Metal Guardian, the band got to play with some well-known international acts like Symphony-X, Joe Stump's Reign of Terror and Hellstar/Distant Thunder. In 2004 MoS signed a record deal with the Italian recordlabel Adrenaline/Steelheart. The debut album, Apathy, was the next logical step. The band found a great producer in VandenBerg's bassplayer Dick Kemper, who already did great productions with bands like VandenBerg, Krezip and Intwine, in his S&K studio. In 2004 the band recorded a MoS version of the Anthrax classic - Madhouse - for the "Tribute to the Glory of 80's Metal" album, as released by Adrenaline/Steelheart.
In october 2005 the debut cd Apathy, containing 10 tracks, was released. It got very good reviews by international media. Check out this site for more info.
Shortly before the recording of the follow-up record in 2006, the band fell apart. Key members Eduard and Gerry pushed on and recorded the second album Absolution together. They also chose to look for a new recordlabel for the release of the album. At this point Mother of Sin has no record deal.
Now in 2008 the line-up is completed by bassplayer Peter Groen and MoS is playing live again. (with e.g. Blaze Baily, Vengeance and Sacred Steel)

MoS has released the Absolution album in 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mother+of+Sin">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
