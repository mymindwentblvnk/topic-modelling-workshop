Spawned from the fiery crucible of personal hardship, Grooms of the Stool is a melodic death metal band formed in Raleigh, North Carolina (US) in 2013. Their sound is a unique blend of melodic, black and progressive death metal over a grim yet beautiful backdrop of distortion. Having recently released their debut album, The Absence of All Good (independently) and toured Europe with Bloodsoaked, GOTS is now looking forward to playing more shows domestically and further promoting what is the culmination of over two years of writing and line-up changes that has come to shape them into the formidable act that they are today. 

The original lineup consisted of Dave Sanchez, Justin Valetta, Adam Johson, and Donald Boyd. 

Due to obligations with other bands (The Hell No / Faith In Ashes) Adam Johnson amicably parted ways with GOTS in early 2014, and Donald (The Other Valledda) Boyd stepped up as lead guitarist. Bassist Adam Peterson (Agony Divine / Blatant Disarray) was recruited to take Don's place on the thump-o-tron, although he too had other obligations which required him to leave the group in November of 2014. 

Following Adam Peterson's departure, Grooms called upon the help of friend Devin Janus (Akrasia / The Dharma Initiative) to fill in. Shortly thereafter he was offered a permanent spot and the band recorded their debut album. This current lineup is the most concrete iteration of the band and since early 2015 they have been a solid touring act with an insatiable appetite for playing live music.
