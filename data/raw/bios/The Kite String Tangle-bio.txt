Introducing “The Kite String Tangle”, the experimental solo project of alternative electronic artist and producer from Brisbane, Danny Harley. Launched in May 2012, “The Kite String Tangle” venture is a seamless blend of ethereal pop through to the darker shades of ambient, electronic music. 

Inspired by musical projects from the likes of Active Child, Jónsi and Fever Ray the contemplative atmosphere of “The Kite String Tangle” actively explores the often elusive feelings of nostalgia and self-reflection through a diverse range of distinctive tracks. 

An extensive background in composition and production has resulted in a captivating arrangement of handcrafted electronic textures and contorted organic samples. The unique, versatile beats and harmonic multifaceted vocals are sure to enchant any audience, whether they’re lounging in a dimly lit backroom or assembled together in the thousands at a major live music event.

With Harley’s other musical ventures leading to popular performances at Splendour in the Grass, Parklife and Peats Ridge festivals, the highly anticipated journey of “The Kite String Tangle” is definitely one to both follow and experience first hand. 2012 is set to be a promising year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Kite+String+Tangle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
