Progressive metal band from Italy.  Pino Tozzi (vocals / Time Machine), Gianluca Ferro (gutar / Arkhé, Fiurach, Doomsword and Time Machine), Mark Vikar (keys / Power Symphony, Beholder), Davide Betelli (bass), and Sigfrido Percich (drums)

The basic idea for forming Heart of Sun springs from the meeting of five artistic personalities which share the love for sound research, the energy of metal, the progressive atmospheres and a little hint of psychedelic. 


After significant musical experiences that lead the guitarist to record and release albums with several metal bands (among which Arkhé, Fiurach, Doomsword and Time Machine), Gianluca meets Mark Vikar (Power Symphony, Beholder) and they begin to work together, united by a strong synergy, at the beginning of 2005. 

The line-up is ultimately settled with the enrolment of Davide Betelli (Ambermoon, Psychörder and several collaborations as a sessionman) and of the drummer Sigfrido Percich (Adramelch, Acron, Indastria) who proposes to do a concept-piece and writes the lyrics as well. 

After spending some months looking for a talented vocalist, the band realizes that they already knew a great vocal-talent! With Pino joining the line-up, the foundations for what is called Heart of Sun is laid! 

Pino is actually satisfied with the stuff written up to now and he massively concurs to enrich the work with the creation of the vocal tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Heart+Of+Sun">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
