The brainchild of snarling lead vocalist/mastermind guitarist Kenny Krenzin and stiletto-wearing drum goddess Lux, Sacred Stormâ€™s metal mayhem enters a state of controlled chaos with the intelligent bass work of Dave Maciel and raw intensity of riff factory Everett De Bree. Formed in 2006, their metal is of intelligent design; blending thrash with melody, technicality with simplicity, harmony with dissonance, brutality with beauty and so forth. All wordy mumbo jumbo aside, Sacred Storm's purpose is simply this: to play their own brand of real metal and to play it real well.

Sacred Storm has opened for The Big Ball Stars featuring members of AC/DC, Motley Crue, Guns and Roses, and Alice Cooper at the Knitting Factory in Hollywood upon lux's return from Warped Tour last summer. Their two-song demo was featured on Skratch Magazine's Compilation CD along with Nevermore, The Casualties, and Against Me! which received nationwide distribution.

In May, Sacred Storm completed recording and producing their debut album Man Versus Machine at Love and Laughter Recording Studio in Anaheim, CA. The album was released as scheduled on May 23rd. Man Versus Machine is already getting FM radio play, online radio play, and online and magazine album reviews across the nation.

Sacred Storm recently returned from their west coast SHRED OR BE DEAD TOUR which kicked off on June 1st with a headlining show in Newport Beach, CA. Along on the tour they opened for Chris Cafferey and Doro in Hollywood at the world-famous Whisky a Go Go. The band opened for Kamelot at the Key Club in Los Angeles on September 2nd to a great crowd reaction. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sacred+Storm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
