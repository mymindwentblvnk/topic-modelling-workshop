Hailing from the central region of Portugal, Terror Empire was formed in 2009 and displays a furious and calculated brand of thrash metal.

It all started when Against – the former band of Ricardo Martins (vocals), Rui Alexandre (guitar) and Rui Puga (bass) – came to an end. Unconvinced that their musical path had ended with it, they got in touch with drummer Gonçalo Marques and guitarist player Sérgio Alves (who had previously played in cover bands) and in a matter of a few months they already had written several songs for the new project.

The name “Terror Empire” represents an omnipresent reality that has been exposed worldwide since the 9/11 attacks. Since then, there has been an official and paranoid propaganda in order to stifle and deprive all human beings from their individual rights, so they can be subdued to the ubiquous feeling of terror.

The band’s main focus has always been to produce a traditional “thrash metal sound” with traces of what has been part of the modern metal sound, such as odd time signatures, breakdowns and a bit of groove.

Since 2009, they have already shared the stage with established outfits such as Pitch Black, Switchtense, Seven Stitches, Angriff or R.D.B., as well as promising newcomers and promising acts like Tales for the Unspoken, Dark Oath, Gatos Pingados and Ventas de Exterco.

Terror Empire will release their debut effort “Face the Terror” in June 2012, a six-song album in which they dwell on the subjects of the new world order and corrupt societies.
