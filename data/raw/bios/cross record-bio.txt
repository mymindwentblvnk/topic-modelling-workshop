Cross Record is the solo project of Emily Cross. While studying fine arts in Ireland through The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Cross discovered her love for songwriting and recording.  Upon her return to Chicago, she began to perform-- experimenting with various musicians around the city.  She met her ex-husband, local recording engineer Dan Duszynski, and forged the creative partnership that became Cross Record. After two albums, they got divorced while recording together for the band Loma, then Emily released Cross Record's self-titled third album.
