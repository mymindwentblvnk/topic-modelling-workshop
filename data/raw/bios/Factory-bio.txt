There are more than one band/act called Factory. Feel free to add information on the others.

1. Factory was a  prog-pop band from Hastings, United Kingdom, formed in May 1970 and comprised of Andy Qunta (lead vocals, guitar), Tony Qunta (lead guitar, electric violin), Geoff 'Jaffa' Peckham (bass) and Laurie Cooksey (drums). Their 1971 recordings sessions yielded a 99-copy-only single, 'Time Machine' b/w 'Castle On The Hill'. They split up in 1976.

2. Factory are a UK band from Liverpool with songs "Dynamite" and "Little Black Book".  2018 saw Factory pick up a management deal with Salvation Records, who broke and manage Swiss Kraut-Disco band Klaus Johann Grobe on an international level. This was followed quickly by the single ‘Crosses’ which was produced by Sugar House (Viola Beach, Pale Waves, Glass Caves). With their first UK headline tour with This Feeling closing out 2018 in style with a sold out Liverpool release show, as well as Fred Perry Subculture naming them as one’s to watch, Factory started 2019 in the same vein with new single ‘Remote Controller’ gaining the band’s first national radio play from Radio X and their first major festival appearance at Y Not Festival. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Factory">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
