At Vance were founded by Lenk, the man already known through his solo albums, as guitarist in the legendary Zed Yago and Progressive project Centers. Their first album, "No Escape" was released in 1998, and followed by "Heart of Steel" two years later. A year after this, in 2001, came the band's third album "Dragonchaser".

After signing with AFM Records in 2002, the band then released "Only Human" before touring Europe with Rhapsody and Angel Dust.

Singer Oliver Hartmann then left the band and a replacement was found in former Yngwie Malmsteen singer Mats Leven.

Lenk spent the next few months writing  2003's album “The Evil In You”. A tour with Kamelot followed. After that, "Chained" was released in 2005 and secured chart entries in Scandinavia. The band then toured with Brainstorm and Mercenary. Mats Leven is no longer a member of At Vance and was replaced by Rick Altzi for their newest album, VII.
