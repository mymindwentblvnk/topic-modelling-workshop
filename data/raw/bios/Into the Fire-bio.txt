American hard rock band INTO THE FIRE was conceived in 2013 by vocalist Bryan Scott (The Union Underground, Cult To Follow), bassist Tim King (SOiL) and guitarist Adam Zadel (SOiL). 
"I was sitting around with Adam one day talking about who would be great to jam with" states bassist Tim King. "I shot Bryan Scott a text message and Into The Fire was born a day later"
The group grabbed onto this opportunity and started putting material together. According to Bryan Scott "As soon as Tim sent me the material I immediately had ideas and started putting vocals down. The music had the perfect vibe for what I wanted to do."
The first 2 released tracks "Spit You Out" and "From The Medicine" were engineered, produced and mixed by Bryan W.Scott and mastered by James Murphy. The result can be best described as a raw and stripped down rock sound with modern elements. Drums for the tracks were performed by ex- Black Label Society drummer Craig Nunenmacher, who was unable to continue with the project due to family obligations. Long time friend Will Hunt (Evanescence, Black label Society) was brought in to replace Craig on drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Into+The+Fire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
