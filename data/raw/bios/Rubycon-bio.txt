Inspired by groups such as; Kings of Leon, The Strokes, The Beatles, Kaiser Chiefs, The Living End, The Rolling Stones, Arctic Monkeys, Django Reinhardt, Bob Dylan, Daft Punk and many more, Rubycon create a new and exciting sound.

The three brothers Sam 18 Max 17 and Riley 12 have been playing together, acoustically, busking in the streets for years. It was not until they plugged in and bought Riley a drum kit, that they realized they needed a bass player. The recent addition of their friend Reuben 17 has added a new dimension to the band.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rubycon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
