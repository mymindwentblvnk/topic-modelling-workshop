Vegas Rhythm Kings is a heavy metal rock n' roll band featuring real zombies. 

After years of sex terror and murder throughout Brisbane and Gold Coast cemeteries these crusty old zombie bastards were discovered by the Zombie Pornstar records crew and taken off to the studio to tell their tales of undead lust and filth through the wonder of song. And so the Vegas Rhythm Kings was born and these putrid undead corpses are gonna rock your fucking socks off ...prepare yourself for their heavy rhythms, disturbing visuals and zombie fuck lust lyrics...The zombies recently located and exhumed suicide victim Mourge-Anna on percussion to complete the bands line-up...
