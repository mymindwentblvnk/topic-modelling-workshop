Arachnid (USA) was formed in 1989 in Portland, OR from the ashes of PDX speed/power metal band Cruella. They released a single 8 track demo in 1992, before splitting up.

Arachnid (Mlt) was Formed in 1996 By Edward and His Brother Mark, since then Arachnid has gone through several line-up changes until 2004 where the band seemed to have setteled down as the new line up: Edward- Vocals, Campos - Guitar, Mark - Guitar, Oliver - Bass, Stephan - Drums. In 2005 recorded their first mcd Entitled Weaving The Web. In September 2005 Arachnid had their first mini tour in France which was good experience for the band. Unfortunately in summer 2006 the band had to go through another line up change when Mark decided to leave the band for Personal reasons. After discussion Arachnid decided not to find a replacement and to go on as a 4 Piece Death Metal Band. Arachnid at the moment are writing new material and will be entering the studio for there next release. In February 2007 ARACHNID entered the studio to record a full-length album - "Compelled to Distort". This took 3 months to finish and we continued refining the sound until a week before the launch gig, which was held on 7th July 2007. We enjoyed the whole process, from the recording to the launch. (CD is available for sale from our website) In March 2008 Arachnid performed with legendary Thrash Metal band Dew Scented. It was also the day that Edward, co-founder of Arachnid decided it was time to end the 12 year journey there for personal reasons. We wish him the best of luck for the future. But despite everything arachnid started looking for a new vocalist immediatly. In April 2008, Roderick Mifsud joined Arachnid as their new front man and again the line up was complete.
