Formerly known as project Essence, Celestial Aeon Project (mp3s downloadable from jamendo.com) is a Finnish orchestral soundtrack project of a hobbyist composer Matti Paalanen. This project follows the footsteps of Danny Elfman, Jeremy Soule and Hans Zimmer, consisting of various atmospheres and feelings. The project carried the name Essence until 9.6.2006. Because of this, mp3s with old tags can be found roaming the Internet.
