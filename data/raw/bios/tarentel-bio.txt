Tarentel began as a post-rock band, making extended, LP-side length instrumental pieces similar to those of Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Mogwai. Over the course three full-length albums and a number of singles and EPs, Tarentel has gradually shifted their style to a looser, more improvisational form that incorporates genres such as noise and drone as well as having a strong psychedelic element.

Tarentel's fifth member, Paul Clipson, projects original Super-8 film compositions that accompany each live performance by the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tarentel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
