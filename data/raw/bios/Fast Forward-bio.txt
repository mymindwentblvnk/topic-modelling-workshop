2.
Hardcore / Punk / Alternative from Los Angeles, USA
FAST FORWARD was formed around 1999 in L.A, CA and is known for their controversially political live shows. Includes mysterious members w/ ties to such organizations as NAZTI SKINZ, WRANGLER BRUTES, THE LOCUST, and LE SHOK. Their music sounds like CHROME or CHRISTIAN DEATH. They have two previous releases on Vermiform and KOTM.

3.
Metal / Industrial / Techno from Ile-de-France, France
They decided to stop all band activities.
Born in 1998 out of the union of Gjalp (Gothic, General Dub) and Didier Ambact (the drummer of formations like Requiem, Treponem Pal and Micropoint), they will be joined in 2004 by Nitroben (the guitarist of Stupéflip, Collapse, Marousse and General Dub). Since its beginning, Fast Forward merges styles like hardcore, metal and industrial, working out a universe shaped like a sound guerrilla, where all kinds of kicks seem to be permitted. Maxis and ep’s follow up each other on the labels Xunk, Moloko +, Epileptik, Toolbox, PKG, Epiteth… Full lenght is called "Mabinogion"
