In 1965 Viola Billups from Alabama and Earnestine and Shirley Pearce met up in a New York recording studio and decided to pool the vocal forces they'd been using in other groups since 1962. They soon made an impression on audiences at the famed Apollo Theatre as well as The Paramount. But somehow despite rave notices that kept them busy from coast to coast and some well received records, the girls never really hit it as big as they hoped. Toward the end of 1967 they decided to try a completely new and for them, hitherto unexplored market-Britain. Since they've been there these three lovely and very talented girls have made an impact in cabaret, toured with great success with Stevie Wonder and have built up an impressive fan following. Many of their fans have in fact wondered when they'd come up with an LP. It was "Sounds Like The Flirtations". The twelve-strong collection included their two previous hits "Someone Out There" and "Nothing But a Heartache" as well as a potential chart topper "What's Good about Goodbye,my Love? "There was also the beautiful "South Carolina". The Flirtations possessed a unique vocal sound and a style that was completely their own. Their voices were beautiful.compelling and full of vitality on every note. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Flirtations">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
