THE INIQUITY DESCENT (T.I.D) was formed in late 2009 by Mikael Mannström in Pietarsaari, Finland. After having a break of songwriting for many years Mikael decided to write a couple of songs and had his childhood friend and former band mate Mathias Lillmåns to take a listen. 

As Mikael and Mathias have had several projects together the last ten years Mathias was immediately interested in joining as vocalist/lyricist. Later on Philip Kerbs joined and took the position as second guitarist, Jonas Frilund on bass and Kenna Nygård on drums.

In 2010 several songs were written and 11 were recorded. 
Four of these ended up on the first EP (Trust The Serpent), released November 2010. The EP got really good reviews and resulted in a mini-tour in Russia and several gigs in Finland. 

Half a year later the band started to work on the next four songs of the previously recorded 11 tracks and the result was the “An Empty Temple” EP. In November 2011 the band signed a record deal with German label Massacre Records and the first full length album will be released in the spring of 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Iniquity+Descent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
