The Symphonic Gothic Metal band Atargatis was founded in 1997 in Regensburg, Germany. The term Atargatis represents the name of the Syrian goddess of existence. 
Atargatis - allegory for the creating power and the origin of life, for the urge for mystic experience, for the unfathomable and inscrutable, both outside of human spheres and deep within...
The voice of Stephanie Luzie (also vocalist of the Austrian gothic band Darkwell) is altering with a male dark voice (Lord Lornhold) while atmospheric keyboards and orchestral lines complete the varying sound of Atargatis. Groovy as well as aggressive though mostly very melodic parts are followed by gentle, solemn passages and are thus interweaved to a mystical sound material.
