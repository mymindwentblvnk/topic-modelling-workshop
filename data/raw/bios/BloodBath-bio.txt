Bloodbath is a Swedish death metal supergroup formed in Stockholm in 1998 when, one evening, friends Mikael Åkerfeldt, Anders Nyström, Jonas Renkse and Dan Swanö, had the idea to play death metal in the realm of Entombed, mixed with some of the US Florida death metal scene bands. Quite simply, Bloodbath was born out of this shared admiration for quality death metal in the old style & the guys quickly realized that they could churn some ugly metal out to a pretty high standard. 

Mikael Åkerfeldt left Bloodbath about a year after the release of "Resurrection Through Carnage" because he wanted to focus on his more serious group Opeth, but he still performed with the band at Wacken 2006. Peter Tägtgren replaced Mikael Åkerfeldt  for the Nightmares Made Flesh release. He then returned to the band in 2008 and left again in 2012.

On September 16th, 2014, it was revealed that Paradise Lost frontman Nick Holmes had been selected as the band's new vocalist. The band has completed recording and mixing their fourth full-length album "Grand Morbid Funeral", which was released on November 17th, 2014 through Peaceville Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bloodbath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
