Sometimes things are just worth waiting for.

Feb 4th, BLACKSTRAP’s long awaited new single “Make Sense Make Change (featuring Victoria Bergsman)” will be released (Declared Goods). With it being over four years since the release of their album Steal My Horses And Run (Tee Pee Records/Sally Forth), it’s evident that time has worked to benefit BLACKSTRAP as they hit a new level for 2013 as a contender.

Originally founded over 10 years ago, Stockholm’s BLACKSTRAP has released 2 albums Ghost Children (2003) and the acclaimed Steal My Horses And Run (2008)- establishing them forerunners of the “next wave of shoegaze” scene. The band’s sound shapeshifts around their influences like spaced-out blues-rock like Loop and Spacemen 3, to German kraut like Neu! and Amon Duul II, to monotone grooves of Suicide and DAF. Founding member and principle songwriter, Jonatan Westh, along with key long-time members Filiph Antonsson and David Karlsson, have taken BLACKSTRAP’s sound into new exciting realms since departure of co-founder Maria Linden (to form her own acclaimed project
I BREAK HORSES in 2010). With the extra special collaboration with TAKEN BY TREES’ Victoria Bergsman, “Make Sense Make Change” is the bridge connecting where the band left off with Steal My Horses And Run, and the sound of the single’s B-Side “Tanz Den Jesus Christus” which holds clues of the bands newer and darker synth driven sound.

BLACKSTRAP enters 2013 with a fresh start and a big year that could finally define them as a band of significant talent - that inexplicably might have gone under the radar without the attention of “Make Sense Make Change” and the forthcoming album late 2013. It’ll be worth the wait.
