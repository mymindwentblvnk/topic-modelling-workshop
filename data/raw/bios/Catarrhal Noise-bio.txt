Catarrhal Noise was a demential band from Noale/Scaltenigo di Mirano (Venice), Italy, active since 1994. They sing in Venetian, that is very hard to understand for foreigners, and even for an Italian living outside Veneto. Moreover, their lyrics are off-the-wall, with a heavy use of colloquial terms. A common concept in their concerts is the one of "rujo", that can be approximately translated as extreme rudeness and unpoliteness and is often a term applied to people living in the country.

Anyway, the band was able to create a large following in Veneto and in other parts of northern Italy thanks to their highly energetic live shows.

They have successfully given 300 concerts, alternating powerful metal songs with comic segments. On July 3, 2004 they even opened a concert for legendary thrash metal band Anthrax.

On October 17, 2007 singer Bullo announced that all the other members had left Catarrhal Noise. The band officially splits-up.

After that, Bullo created Rumatera with Rocky Gio and other two members. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Catarrhal+Noise">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
