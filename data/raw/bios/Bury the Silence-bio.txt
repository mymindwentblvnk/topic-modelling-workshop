Bury the Silence is an American Technical Death Metal/Deathcore band from Muskegon, Michigan. Formed in 2009 by Josh Hibbs, and Roger Gundy. The band is vocalist Adam Garvey, Lead/Rhythm Guitarist Roger Gundy, Rhythm/Lead Guitarist Corey Bradfield, Bassist Josh Hibbs, and Drummer Nathan Krehn. Bury the Silence released their first studio EP (Extended Play CD) entitled "Phobiotic" in November 2010. Since the band's formation, they have accomplished more than expected from a "young band" by playing many shows around Michigan, opening for national bands such as Chimaira, Impending Doom, Daath, This or The Apocalypse, Salt the Wound, and Legend, going on a small tour in spring 2010, and getting signed to an independent label (Stay True Records). BtS is showing no signs of slowing down with their relentless assault of shows around the state (and soon out of state), and planning to start working on a full length album in summer of 2011.
