The American singer grew up in Baltimore and moved to Hamburg in 2013 to attend film school. There, she started recording music, and eventually ended up working with Mense Reents from Die VÃ¶gel, who helped her record the LP. The label promises "spartan arrangements and electronic textures," and songs where "Kennedy doubles and multiplies her voice and sings alongside herself in a choir." Pampa says Sophia Kennedy is its first "songwriting record."
