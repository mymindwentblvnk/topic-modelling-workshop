Alexander attended Plumcroft Primary School in Plumstead followed by Crown Woods Secondary School in Eltham both in South East London. In his teenage years he began writing songs & experimenting with bands. Upon leaving school Alexander formed his 1st band proper 'Taxi' with Jamie Cullum after a chance encounter in a guitar shop on London's Denmark St. The band enjoyed mild live success and toured with Paul Weller before finally imploding in the summer of 2002 due, partly, to Jamie's pending solo deal with Universal & partly due to musical differences. During this time Alexander's Grandmother Betty died. He took her maiden name as his own and decided to pursue a solo career, he began writing the songs that would go on to form his debut solo album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alexander+Wolfe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
