The Bergen, Norway based band Among Gods was initially formed in 2010 as a studio sideproject for vocalist Kenneth «Ripper» Olsen. 

Among Gods delivers a unique mixture of old school death / doom metal.
During the fall of 2011 the band recorded their self-titled debut album in Conclave & Earshot Studios. It was released in 2012 through PRC Music. The debut album is available on LP, CD and digital edition. 
In 2013 the second album «Monument» was recorded and produced in Mølla Lydstudio. Monument was released in 2014 through PRC Music. This album is available on CD. 
During 2015 the album "Ghost Empire" was penned and recorded in Lydapotekhet and shows a blend of the classic Among Gods sound and pure doomsday. The Ghost Empire album will be released in late 2015.
Among Gods brought doom to various scenes since 2011, including festivals like Southern Discomfort and Mølla Festival, and have done shows at legendary scenes as Garage (Bergen) and John Dee (Oslo) among others.
