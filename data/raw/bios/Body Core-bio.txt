Like a postcard from a carcrash!
Like a lament from dying lips!

Body Core is a band that fear no means in creating their headstrong metal. 

The band is a promising act from southern sweden that easily and irresponsible travels between heavy deathmetal and brutal grind to merry day trips to jazz and bossacountry, among other things. The music has been well recieved by swedish and foregin medias. Sweden Rock Magazine writes, among other things, that Body Core's "anarchistic extreme experimental music bubbles with ideas" and metalheart.se describes Body Core's music as if "John Zorn would have written Brutal Truth's Extreme Conditions Demand Extreme Responses". 

There's a large scale of words to define Body Core's sound: dynamic, progressive, refreshing, aggressive, atmospheric and utterly fucking uncompromising. The Influences are gained from dozens of musical genres. Body Core will continue to make people angry and pleased in their crusade for musical anarchy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Body+Core">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
