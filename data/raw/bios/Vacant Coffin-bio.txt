In early 2007 Jussi and Lasse formed Vacant Coffin to satisfy their grinding need for fast, dirty and short songs. The case is: old school grindcore mixed with old school death/black metal riffing and hardcore punk. The guys have a history of playing together in the deathrashers Phlegethon. Before Phlegethon existed ( - Â´88) they played in numerous different grind, noise, hc, punk, crossover bands/projects like S.P.F., Acne Vulgarius, Amok... Unfortunately Jussi had no time for the band so Lasse recorded "The Thrashed Supper" -demo by himself in 2007. The line up was completed pretty soon after the demo was unleased as Lasse asked Pete for the bass and Pekka was found for the drums. The US label Razorback Records released a full-lenght Vacant Coffin album named Sewer Skullpture in 2008. According to the Myspace of Vacant Coffin, they are on a break at the moment. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vacant+Coffin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
