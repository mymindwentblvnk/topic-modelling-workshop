"Possibly one of the most genuinely involving noise projects I've come across recently... Each piece sounds like they've laid their hands on the instruments for the very first time and are mightily pissed off about it... Blood Moon sound something like early King Crimson if they had been twenty years later and spent most of their time undergoing experiments with Electro Convulsive Shock Therapy... Sonic colour mixing through liquidisation."

"Out of chaos, they say, comes order, and there’s something of that truth to Blood Moon. There’s also a strange sense of beauty. On one level, the music makes no sense; on another, the swirling waves of distortion and endless anticipation present something labyrinthine and attractively hypnotic. It is art as music, music as art and as brilliantly leftfield as it comes."

"Although there’s little point in trying to describe their racket other than to say it’s wholly unneighbourly, the overall effect created by these Manny morons is similar to Israeli outfits such as Poochlatz and Barbara, though considerably more tuneful due to Blood Moon’s compassionate (though too occasional) use of sax and piano (albeit ring-modulated to fuck)."
