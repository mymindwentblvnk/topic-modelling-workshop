The Blues Explosion is an American garage rock band formed in 1990 in New York City. After the demise of Spencer's D.C. band Pussy Galore, he teamed up with guitarist Judah Bauer and drummer Russell Simins to form The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion (sometimes abbreviated to JSBX). They were known by this name until 2004, which Spencer changed because "It's always been a band, never a solo project," saying "the name change honors a band." 

Their sound is a diverse and raw combination of punk rock, blues, noise, rock & roll, soul, funk, urban, and rockabilly, with an occasional theremin solo. Members played in bands such as NYC's The Honeymoon Killers and Boss Hog prior to the formation of the Blues Explosion. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blues+Explosion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
