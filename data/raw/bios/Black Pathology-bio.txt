Black Pathology started as a drum machine project created by Adam Medford. After a few internet releases, Mike Purple joined on drums which allowed the project to be actualized into a live act. Shortly after Tim joined on bass and together the three recorded their self titled demo. Line up changes would result in drastic changes with the band. Today the band is in hiatus.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Pathology">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
