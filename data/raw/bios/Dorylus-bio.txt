We’re a 4 piece metal band from Hertfordshire that plays Death/Thrash Metal. We’re heavily influenced by Slayer, Machine Head, Death, Amon Amarth and lots more. Since our inception in January 2015 we have managed to obtain a good following and have released an EP entitled ‘The Rapture’. We were finalists in the London M2TM competition 2016, and have also had the honour of playing the Underworld in Camden Town, plus many more. We are seriously interested in gigging in further afield than Hertfordshire and London, and are willing to travel. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dorylus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
