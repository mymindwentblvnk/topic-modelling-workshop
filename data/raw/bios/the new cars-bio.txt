The New Cars was an American rock group that was a reunion of some of the original members of The Cars, with singer-songwriter Todd Rundgren on vocals (replacing Ric Ocasek). They released just one full album, titled 'It's Alive', which showcased a live show featuring classic tracks by The Cars as well as three brand new studio tracks. The work earned them critical acclaim from several publications.

The band was formed in 2005. In 2006, with opening act Blondie, the band went on the "Road Rage Tour." Due to a shoulder injury from a motor vehicle accident, guitarist Elliot Easton was forced to cease touring with the band in later 2006. This resulted in the cancellation of the remaining tour dates during that period.

After his recovery, the band resumed touring in the first quarter of 2007, mostly playing casino venues. A great many fans of Rundgren's previous work and of the Cars' classic 80s rock enjoyed the group's efforts as they jotted from city to city. However, it wouldn't be too long before the outfit broke up, with Rundgren returning to his solo efforts.
