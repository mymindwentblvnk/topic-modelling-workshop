Schmyt is a German singer and rapper. Following a musically shaped childhood and youth in Viersen, he studied jazz and pop in Arnhem. This is where he joined the band Rakede in 2007, which disbanded in 2020. In the same year, a collaboration followed by the debut single Niemand a month later heralded the beginning of his solo career. The debut album Universum regelt was released in 2022, and Schmyt signed a worldwide writer's exclusive contract with Universal Music Publishing and participated in live performances and studio recordings of other musicians.

The first performances under the name of Schmyt are the collaboration with Yassin for the soundtrack to the novel Taubenleben by Paulina Czienskowski, released in February 2020, and Monoton, a collaboration with Megaloh and Majan, released in April of the same year. As his first own song under the stage name, he released Niemand in the same month. The second single was Taximann; like the first single, produced by Bazzazian. According to Schmit, Bazzazian became aware of him through a demo version of Taximann. The single was strongly oriented to Bad Religion by Frank Ocean.

On April 2, 2021, he released the EP Gift. As the first single release, the title track appeared as a collaboration with RIN. The song reached number 49 on the German charts.

The music video for "Universum regelt" announced the debut album of the same name, which was released on May 20, 2022.
