3) Materia is a Melodic Black Metal band from Puerto Rico - formed in 2009 by Alessandro Ubriaco, better known by his stage name Jani as a one-man band. Materia originally formed as an instrumental band but, Jani got some inspiration from death and apocalyptic themes and incorporated that into more recent work.
 
In spite of Jani's previous attempt to instigate an instrumental project this has proved that he speaks more for "the art of shredding". The song structures may not differ into a Power Metal criteria but, rather a conventional type of Melodic Black Metal with a strong utilization of tremolo picking and generic intros but, have a finesse of occasional soloing break downs, which include; sweep picking, tapping, harmonized scales etc. in the vein of Yngwie Malmsteen and Wintersun.  

Materia's pre-band was known as Winter Souls. Winter Souls really did fulfill the transition, which is still undergoing in Winter Souls of Power Metal and Shred. As Jani slowly eased into Black Metal - he slowly hired session members as vocalists which eventually evoked the sound, that he could use. 

Industrial-wise, Jani thinks of independence as an important role in musicianship. Even analyzing the small things such as production and album covers would be significant towards his independence thus, making him unsigned. It would be important to know how to "figure things out" in order to really know how they work. Then it would slowly turn to a new evolution of music.

Although, Jani did use Hex Productions on one EP, he moved away from the labels and actually fulfilled his duties as an independent musician and was ready to move on since he got the hang of it. Furthermore, recruiting Lorell as a keyboardist. Not only this but, he was ready to start doing live shows therefore, hiring two new live session members; Randall on guitars and Bryan on drums.

Materia has an increasing reputation and after performing live the fans were ceased to be impressed. Materia is still actively making a vast quantity of EPs and have so far one album entitled "Dreams of Paradise" which was released in April 2nd, 2010 along with several other EPs. Materia is currently working on material for their TBA album "Sinister Aura".
