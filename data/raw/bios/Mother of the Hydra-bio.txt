Mother Of The Hydra is a black metal band born in 2006 when V-kaos was still living in Sweden.

The debut album "Contradiction" was recorded in 2010 but only released on CD in 2012 due to issues with the first label. Now out through Bubonic and Nekrogoat Heresy prod.

Mother Of The Hydra is just as much about the experimental ritualistic tracks as it is about the more traditional black metal tracks.

The lyrical concept and idea behind the band is the contradiction of us as mortal human beings of the flesh and immortal beings in spirit - and how this might just be a false image keeping us back. This is something often reflected upon in older alchemical works and thus we take inspiration from such sources. The music and lyrics is a way of exploring these paths for us.

V-kaos is currently working on the next full-length which will go under the title "Expurgation". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mother+Of+The+Hydra">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
