Created in 1999 by Shannon Hamm (Control Denied, Death, Metalstorm) and Chris Williams (Control Denied 1996-1997, Talonzfury, Pain Principle). The definitive bassist was unclear, but Todd (Metalstorm, Elvis Tribute Artist) was definitely the voice that Beyond Unknown required. Death had just completed "The Sound Of Perseverance" world tour in December 1998, and began recording Control Denied "The Fragile Art Of Existence" in 1999. After it's completion, Beyond Unknown rehearsed for a few weeks and recorded drum tracks on a 4 song demo. That demo remained incomplete as Chris Williams' life was taken in a tragic automobile accident on the afternoon of 12/12/2000... Beyond Unknown was placed on indefinite hold. Exactly 1 year and 1 day later, on 12/13/2001, we lost another very close friend... Chuck Schuldiner. In time, the concept of Beyond Unknown became very deep and personal, which ultimately inspired it's completion in 2005. Beyond Unknown is currently being mastered and will soon be available as an "In Memory" e.p. so to speak, dedicated to Chris Williams and Chuck Schuldiner. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beyond+Unknown">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
