Dino Felipe has made "music" since the age of 6 on tape recorders embracing the 4track at age 16 and ever since filling tapes up with musik, until he financed a gateway when he was 21.  Dino was in what are now called "noise" bands from the age 16-21, although he hates the label "noise", only beacuse he strictly believes it is MUSIC. If attempted to be described Dino's music is psychedelic, electronic, with large pop infusion and piles of ideas compressed into a song. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dino+Felipe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
