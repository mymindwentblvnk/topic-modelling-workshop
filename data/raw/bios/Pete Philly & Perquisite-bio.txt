Vocalist Pete Philly and producer/instrumentalist Perquisite met up for the first time in 2002 in Amsterdam, where both were living. Perquisite, who also ran the Dutch indie now jazz/hip-hop label Unexpected Records, liked what he heard in the Aruba-born singer and rapper, and by the next year the duo had issued its first EP, MindState. In 2005 it was followed by a full-length European release, including a guest appearance from Talib Kweli. In 2006, MindState came out in North America and Australia. 

In January 2007 they released 'Remindstate', a remix version of Mindstate. Artists like Laidback Luke, Seiji and C-mon & Kypski remixed tracks. In 2007 they also released their 2nd official album called 'Mystery Repeats', which reached the 2nd place in the Dutch album charts, the best chart position ever achieved by a Dutch hip-hop act. 

Pete Philly & Perquisite created hip-hop music with references to jazz, broken beats, soul and even classical music. This Dutch hip-hop act performed at North Sea Jazz and Lowlands (Dutch music Festival) and won the 'Zilveren Harp' in 2006.

In October 2009 they gave their final performance at a sold-out Melkweg.
