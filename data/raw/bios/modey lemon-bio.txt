Modey Lemon are a punk-blues band from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The group formed in 1999 as an informal side project of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion-fixated Dean Swagger. The original lineup consisted of Phil Boyd (guitar) and Paul Quattrone (drums), then nominally students at the University of Pittsburgh.

By 2000, the duo gained a reputation around Pittsburgh for blistering, often chaotic live performances (Quattrone was known for on-stage acrobatics). Modey Lemon, the group's debut, appeared in early 2002; the band supported the album with tours of the U.S. and Europe. Prior to the mid-2003 release of second album Thunder and Lightning, Boyd and Quattrone added Pittsburgh audiophile (and Thunder and Lightning producer) Jason Kirker on guitar and Moog synthesizer.

The Modey Lemon has performed with The White Stripes, The Von Bondies, the Blues Explosion, Oneida, the Warlocks, the Icarus Line, and Dinosaur Jr., to name a few.

Third album The Curious City was released in mid-August 2005. The cover art, appropriately, is a fractured homage to Pittsburgh's skyline.

Boyd and Quattrone also participate in a side project, Cobalt Black (formerly The Four Seasons Boys), with both members of fellow Pittsburgh band Grand Buffet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Modey+Lemon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
