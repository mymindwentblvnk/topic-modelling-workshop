KIRKKOPALOVAROITUS is a black metal band originally conceived in 1998 by Dr. Shitz. Today, highly influenced by the progenitors of the second wave of black metal in Scandinavia, Kirkkopalovaroitus is a duo comprised of Mørk and Dr. Shitz, each lending their skills to musical christbashing with an underlying current of darkness. Inherently weak and based on falsehoods, all religion must be crushed.

KIRKKOPALOVAROITUS stands for the eradication of all religious thought; while using symbolism inherent in the system, they are meant as similes and as introductory notes for the real goal: total rejection of religion.
