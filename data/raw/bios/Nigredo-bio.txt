2). Nigredo is a post-rock band from Atlanta, GA.

3). NIGREDO (Greece) - black metal.
Members of reputed bands like RAVENCULT, EMBRACE OF THORNS and DEPHOSPHORUS, we have NIGREDO from Greece changing the way we look at black metal. Whilst maintaining the rawness and intensity, they're deftly incorporating elements of death and thrash metal and mangling them to suit their dark aesthetic. There's integrity and at the same time a forward-thinking approach not too unlike BOLZER or NORSE, but their grit remains predominant. Their structures are unpredictable but that's only because their momentum is relentless. There is a headrush listening to 'Flesh Torn - Spirit Pierced', which is easily one of the most resolute as well as daring albums this style has seen in recent times.
