There is more than artist with this name: 

1. Pilori is a German neofolk band with three members; Inge Breichler, Gernot Musch, Marion Musch.

.. Founded 1996 by Marion and Gernot more as a hobby than as a serious band Pilori quickly managed to gain some local popularity by supporting live shows of Sol Invictus, Hekate, Sieben, Shadow Project and many others booked by dear friends Mother Dance. 1999 the well-known German label [Trinity] - today Trisol - got in touch with them and signed them up. Within the next four years Pilori released the Albums "Soufre", "...and when the twilight's gone (la recolte)" and the very gloomy "Zeit des Lichts" and gigs lead them throughout different countries in Europe like Spain, Portugal, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. In Germany they played also many gigs and three well received shows on the famous Wave-Gotik-Treffen in fabulous Leipzig. The melancholic and enchanting music, lead by the beautiful voice of Marion, found lots of friends in those years. After the release of their musically most complex, reflective and melancholic fourth album "Elegia" a major change occured, when 2004 Pilori - who despite of several musicians helping out in live shows insisted on staying a duo - were expanded by a third full time member Inge Breichler, a godess on the viola.
