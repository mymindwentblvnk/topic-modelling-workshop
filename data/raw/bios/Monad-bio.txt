Monad - any basic metaphysical entity, esp. having an autonomous life.

BRAINCORE about MONAD :
“The evolution from drummer/bass player to frantic, melodic breakcore genius is now complete….Monad’s sound is an orchestra of pounding beats, rumbling bass, drill & bass style and grinding synths that will whip your mind into a frenzy.”
comments/e-mails are welcome.

MONAD is also the name of my electronic music project/live band.
im a bass player/drummer (playing with real people most of the time) but somewhere around 2004 when things started getting cheaper, i got into recording/making electronic music. so now you can hear/see the results. EP was out only on mp3s and the last album was out on CD in belarussia on deadpixel records and on VINYL, self pressed (order your copy today! hehe)
ive played gigs all over lithuania and in poland, norway, latvia and hopefully near you soon!
always looking for gigs, for bookings just contact me, all i need is a way to get from one place to another and where to sleep and smtn to eat. i dont do it for the money. its all DIY :P :O:[]
