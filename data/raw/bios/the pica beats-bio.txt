The Pica Beats began in Vermont in 2005 as a solo vehicle for Ryan Barrett, who soon made his way to the West Coast and had settled in Seattle by the time of his debut, 2007's self-recorded/released gem, All Mysteries Solve Themselves. Shortly thereafter, Barrett joined forces with drummer Colin English to begin a collaborative vision for The Pica Beatsâ€”the product of which would grow to become the patient, post-summer soundtrack world known.

The live set-up currently consists of: Ryan Barrettguitar, singing, writing, Marian Li-Pino on drums, Alice Sandahl singing misc percussion, and Johnny Goss on bass.
