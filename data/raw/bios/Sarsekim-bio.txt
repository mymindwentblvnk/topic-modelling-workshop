In 1998, from the ashes of the now defunct Dark Intent came the members of Sarsekim. A desire to create enigmatic death metal with influences from all sides of the musical spectrum led the members to where they are now - in a state of freedom to create anything. Within a framework with undefined limits they have a distinct style that is set apart from the masses. Sarsekim has been likened to many of the great death metal bands of years past and present, yet never has been put into the category of the clone like many these days are.

Sarsekim have released 2 E.P's - 'Aegri Somnia Vana' - A 6 track E.P. in 2000, with former guitarist Brendan Mueller and former Drummer Nicholas Cole, which sold out soon thereafter, and 'Paroxysm' in 2005 with the current line up minus Jon Dewar who joined more recently. Sarsekim now has a line up that is working well and have finalized recording of their debut full length album to be released late 2007.

Sarsekim are formed in Adelaide, Australia.

Current members:
David Williams - Vocals
Aaron Tuck - Guitars (ex-Deluge)
Darren McLennan - Guitars (The Harrowed, formerly known as Fury)
Jon Dewar - Bass (Altars)
Alan Cadman - Drums (Altars)
