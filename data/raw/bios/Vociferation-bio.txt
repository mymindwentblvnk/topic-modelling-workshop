"We are four piece metal band, which takes influeces from stoner rock, rock'n'roll, blues but mostly death metal. In short, we call it just death'n'roll. We started to play at winter in 2010, when No_use was looking for a bass player to play at some Indie rock band and called to Ainis, but instead of playing indie Ainis suggested to play something heavier and introduced No_use to MÄ—melsas. That took us together to play some kick ass music. Later on, Mr.G. joined us, so we started to play with full force. "
