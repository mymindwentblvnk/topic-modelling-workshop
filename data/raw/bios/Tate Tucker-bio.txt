Born and raised in sunny Los Angeles, Rapper, Songwriter and Producer Tate Tucker was primed for the entertainment industry from a young age. The son of an actor/acting coach, Tucker was exposed to both the glitz and glam of his city as well as its ability to chew up and spit out the dreams of its inhabitants. Committed to escape that cycle, Tucker moved out to Washington, DC in 2010 to expand his horizon and soak up a new culture with new influences. Months later, he had the opportunity of a lifetime to perform in front of Lupe Fiasco and renowned hip-hop scholar Dr. Michael Eric Dyson. Overnight, the video garnered over 150 thousand views on World Star Hip-Hop and from that moment on, he has proceeded to make his mark on the hip-hop community, constantly pushing the once-rigid boundaries of the genre. 

Since then, Tucker has released a breadth of music in pursuit of his sound--one of which, "Harlem Shake," received over 6 million views on youtube and was even televised on CBS Entertainment Tonight and the song was aired on Paris' Skyrock FM radio station. Currently sitting on over 100 unreleased tracks, Tucker is working tirelessly on an EP with his in house production team that he plans to drop Fall 2015. With over 100 performances under his belt, almost 7 million youtube views and over 10,000 followers on his social media platforms, Tate Tucker is a name to look out for in 2015. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tate+Tucker">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
