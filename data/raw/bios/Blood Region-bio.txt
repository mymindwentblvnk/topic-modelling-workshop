Blood Region was formed in Karstula in beginning of year 2002,
when first line-up gathered in the dense backwoods to burst out 
first notes of Korpi-Metal.A lot of rehearsing and some recordings 
were done during those times,yet they all stayed more or less in a 
small circle and unreleased.Different line-ups,different material
and some planning went on.Yet,also time passed and left BR to rest 
for years to come...
...until 2011 the flame was recovered and lot of song-writing,
rehearsing and plans were done.And so by january 2015 the band entered 
the The GuardCastle,the studio owned by Jakke "Naughty-Jack" Valkeinen,to
record the first official release.As it was planned;the recording captured 
the raw sound,harsh approach and the hybrid elements of old thrash and nwobhm.
After good feedback and enthusiasm,after a while band entered studio to 
record a song,"Metalheads" as a tribute to the roots,regions and friends.Then 
it was short time to have little break and compose some new and rearrange some 
old songs.
On freezing january 2016,Blood Region crew travelled once again to capture 
new songs on tape,at Naughty-Jacks new studio.This time with a bit more thought,
with atmospheric and more melodic approach and sharpened arragements.
First ep "Of Northern Fire" was recorded and it contains three diverse,
yet really BR-sounding songs,...having that edge of raw metal but with a touch
of new elements and different genres,nevertheless,...it is Korpi-Metal,pure like 
moonshine in its own way.
The band goes on,...rehearsing,doing new songs,looking forward to do gigs,
a music video and record new material near future.Bound to Blood Region of Northern
Fire...step into realm of backwoods and experience the real and honest Korpi-Metal!!!
