Toronto-based production/songwriting duo Lasko & Kestler have quite the evocative story: The pair lived in the woods in an undisclosed location miles from Canadian civilization; since returning to Toronto, they wear masks to hide the frostbite that left their faces disfigured after being stranded in a snowstorm. Mystery shrouds the pair in a world of darkness that finds life in their music. Whether we take this tale at face value or not, the characterization builds perfectly into the group’s dark avant-pop. Lasko & Kestler describe their sound as “equal parts music for the bedroom and a seductive soundtrack to a nightmare,” and “The View” is one dream you might not want to wake from. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/LASKO+&+KESTLER">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
