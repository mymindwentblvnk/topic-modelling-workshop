Recently, Jonas has been working with bassist Steve Sexton, drummer Gary Oppert & keyboard/guitar player Brandon Vaughn from USA on the second OSV album, called 'Second Thoughts'. I played lead guitar on 9 tracks. This is a progressive/fusion instrumental project, expect great musicianship from all parts!
