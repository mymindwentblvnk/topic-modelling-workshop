There is likely more than one band called Samedi:

Samedi (1) was a swedish synthpop band from Bollnäs in the mid/late 80s in the wake of the success of british synthpop and into an awakening swedish synth scene. They sprung up long before other swedish bands with that special swedish synth pop sound like Elegant Machinery and Mobile Homes that unlike Samed reached much wider audiences about the time that Samedi withdrew.

Samedis sound seems to be inspired by a broad range of early 80s british electronic acts, like OMD, the Human League and Soft Cell.

The band was made up by Emmanuel Kjellberg (vocals), Per Norin (synthesizers, backing vocals) and Hans Kjellberg (synthesizer, backing vocals).

Samedi has released atleast three singles on the small label Canned Music, and they recorded in Bollnäs and Stockholm 1987-89.
In the last decade they have only made it in with their old songs to an occasional compilation (like Retronics)  of swedish synthpop from the 80s. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Samedi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
