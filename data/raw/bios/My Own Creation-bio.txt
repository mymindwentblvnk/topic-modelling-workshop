"MOC" was formed in Maracay(Venezuela), in the year of 2008 by a group of local and experienced musicians who wanted to create aggressive, technical and melodic music with a concept of their own imagery based on SciFi and the evolution of conscience. The idea was on mind and working in the early 2006, after a couple of years the right ones were chosen and now they are ready to bring their concept to the masses.

The band members were involved in other musical projects prior to MOC, even outside of their country. Some of them still working with other bands and jobs related with music.

MY OWN CREATION's music could be described as a perfect blend of technical stuff (like Meshuggah and the Faceless) and an unique and catchy sound that can grab your attention immediately without being commercial! 

The band is getting ready to Release their Debut Album! It will be an Independent Release so far!
In the meantime you can listen the new Single "upwards, Downwards" and their others 2 Teasers!

The bandnd is currently looking for label, a good deal who let them spread their music as far as they can.

Prepare for the experience!
