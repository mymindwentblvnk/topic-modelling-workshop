A Minneapolis-based indie rock band known for their raw and haunting sound, Dad Bod’s dreamy lullabies & guitar distortion have quickly made them a band to watch. Dad Bod started as Callie Marino’s bedroom project, but in November of 2019 the full band formed with Marino as the frontperson, lead guitarist Wilson Zellar, guitarist Noah Topliff, and drummer Alex Gray. In less than a year, Dad Bod has released two singles and one EP which have been lauded by fans and critics alike. 
The group was acquainted with each through the Minneapolis music scene with some already playing together in another band. With Marino’s lyrical perspective, Dad Bod formed and was an instant success realizing their first single “Rot”. Drawing inspiration from artists such as The Cranberries, the quad adds stabs of shoegaze to Marino's dreamy, dark lullabies.
In July of 2020, Dad Bod released their first EP “Precursor”. A stripped-down, acoustic collection of songs curated during the COVID 2020 Quarantine. Right from the opening “4/9,” Dad Bod reveals a world unto itself - “Marino sings in a forlorn tone as if the ending was inevitable or that all human attachments are fragile,” said Robb Donker Curtius of American Pancake. The multi-dimensional and poetic lyrics have also come to define Dad Bod’s sound. Stay tuned for their full-length album in the near future.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DAD+BOD">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
