Bitchcraft refers to at least three bands:

1. Bitchcraft is the name of polish Black Sabbath inspired doom/stoner metal band from Pozna≈Ñ.

The band released two albums: "evil thing" in 2012 and "bitchcraft" in 2013.

2. Bitchcraft was the name of an all-female Trash/Speed metal from Detroit, USA, and was formed out of the ashes of Anghell in 1995.

But their story would be even shorter than the one of Anghell; Bitchcraft released a self-titled demo in '95, "Bitchcraft", but that was to be the legacy of Bitchcraft, as in 1996 they split-up for good.

3. Bitchcraft is an all female Oz Rock band from Newcastle, Australia that formed in 2001. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bitchcraft">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
