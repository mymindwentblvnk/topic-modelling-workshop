Jesust began as Mark Wursten and Bacon getting together to write some music after the end of their last band Clifton. They spent some time writing songs, and smoking weed (and dropping a little bit of LSD) and the rest is history. Jesust recorded their debut "Smokin' Wisdom" with Salt Lake Engineering Badass Extraordinaire Andy Patterson (Gaza, Ascend, Form Of Rocket) which can be had for free with a simple google search.

Jesust are heavily influenced by the following: Weed, Black Sabbath, Down, Corrosion Of Conformity, Pantera, The Utah Jazz, and Weed.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/JESUST">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
