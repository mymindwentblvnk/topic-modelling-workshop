The world of Cid Rim circles around the boundless magic and mythical formulas of funk. When speaking of his influences and musical socialisation, the 25 year old producer and drummer of JSBL inevitably ends in the 70ies of the past century. Think of the JBs, big band sounds á la Stan Kenton or the drum breaks, which widely opened his personal doors to funk.

Through constant exchange with his band colleagues Dorian Concept and The Clonious he sharpened his producer skills and also pushed forward into hiphop and experimental electronica. While startin´ as an enthusiastic sample digger his current works unfold a tempo-independence, a playful and interlaced sound, shifted with deep chords (he just can’t resist). A hybrid of programmed beats and analogue drum patterns meets razorsharp grooves and monumental power-steps. 

In the style of a quarterback he ambitiously connects all team parts into a homogenous unit. Cid Rim, he wears the number 8. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cid+Rim">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
