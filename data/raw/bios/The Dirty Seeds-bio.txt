The Dirty Seeds ~ Texas

Bandcamp

Face melting stoner rock from Houston, TX with enough of a groove to trick white people into thinking they know how to dance.

Frustrated with a music scene dominated by wuss rock and sad emo kids, The Dirty Seeds have sprouted to bring real rock music to Houston. Laying down grooves as heavy and dirty as the Houston air, The Dirty Seeds are making their way to a venue near you to save your earholes from the skinny jeans/guyliner wearing bands you've become accustomed to.
