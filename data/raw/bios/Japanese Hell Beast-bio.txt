One day, back in the days of late 2005, Reg decided he would like to start a grind band but was not having much luck in finding members. Oh goodness he thought. His jolly friend Olie said to him "I will be a bass." and Reg said to Olie "Well that would be delightful but you appear to be a drummer." and then Olie said "Yes I am." and Reg said "I would be delighted to have a bass like yourself." And thus, the first step had been achieved. The band consisted of more than one person. Lovely. But further strokes of bad luck followed. No drummers. Finally Reg gave up on his search for a drummer and decided he would invest in a drum machine. Blast. Expensive. But then HURRAH! The Great Grandmother of Reg died and left him some money. "What a splendid occurence" said Reg. "Now I may purchase a drum machine". And this is precisely what Reg did. Olie took him in his automobile to a drum machine selling location and a young chap named DR.Bree was purchased. Later on, I believe it may have quite possibly been the 28th of December, The Hell Beasts had their first practise and then Udds and Lucy got angry because apparently Udds was in the band but alas. This was not true. How odd it was that the young Lucy would become so angered when it was not really anything to do with her. Shit on her we will. So that was the story of the creation of Japanese Hell Beast. We do hope you enjoyed yourself. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Japanese+Hell+Beast">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
