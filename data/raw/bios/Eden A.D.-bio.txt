Eden A.D. have spent the last five years not only refining their songwriting and sharpening their live performance, but striving for music that can stimulate even the most jaded metalheads. Combining all things epic, dark, and heavy, their music aims for a unique edge through diverse song compositions, rather than contriving a new style. After years of ripping through the stages of New York City on a rigorous gig schedule and gaining the respect of the local scene, the band broadened their exposure through more long-distance shows, including a slot supporting God Forbid and Full Blown Chaos on their Puerto Rico Tour. After two demos that were praised for displaying the songwriting skill of an established signed band, Eden a.d. released their debut full-length on Spare Change Records in 2008. For the album, titled "Cycles of Relevance," they expanded their influences but kept their focus on the integrity and diversity of song arrangements. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eden+A.D.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
