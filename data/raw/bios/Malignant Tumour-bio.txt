Formed in Ostrava, Czech Republic in 1991, Malignant Tumour was one of the first grindcore/mincecore bands in their state, with Martin Bilos BÃ­lek being the only constant member throughout the band's career. 

For a considerable period of time, they bore a so-called gore image in their music and lyrics, and released a bunch of split CDs and demo records until switching to socially aware lyrics with such topics as inequality, fascism, racism, homophobia, and worldwide enslavement systems. It took them the total of 12 years to put out their first full-length studio album Dawn of a New Age through Insane Society Records in 2003. Later on, Malignant Tumour dropped the grindcore sound and switched on to playing a mixture of crust punk and heavy metal, releasing an album every two or three years.
