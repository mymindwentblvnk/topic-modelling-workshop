Lying Figures formed in 2008 with guitarists Mehdi and Matthieu and took little by little shape until stabilizing with the incoming of singer Thibaut (Octavion), drummer Charles (Ataraxis) and bass player Ludo.
Sometimes melodic, sometimes brutal but always heavy and oppressive, their music is inspired by tortured art as well in music,as in cinema or literature. From Saturnus to Katatonia, from David Lynch to John Carpenter, Edgar Allan Poe to Lovecraft and through Silent Hill or Alice in Wonderland, the band deploys a universe in which madness and melancholy are dancing together. 
In June 2013, after a few shows welcomed by the public, a free downloadable demo “From Nowhere to Nothing” was released. The positive fallouts of the reviews allowed the band to gain in popularity.
Confirmation comes in May 2014 with the band's first six track EP “A World of My Own”. This EP affirms the band’s potential with a more personal and mature style.
Lying Figures and Ludo decide to stop their collaboration because of professional issues but a new bass player, Fred (Inborn Suffering, Drowning, Marthyr) joins in.
