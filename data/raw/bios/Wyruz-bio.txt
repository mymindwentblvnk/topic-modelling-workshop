Wyruz is a metal band from Norway that’s been in the Norwegian underground since 2002. Their style is somewhere between thrash and death metal, with the obvious influence more on the technical side. 
Wyruz seems to be evolving fast now in present 2011 and are currently in the studio recording their first ever studio album. The release is rumored to be in June 2011. 
So with great anticipation we wait for the first full length album. The song “Terminal” will be released on a promo-compilation before the actual album, and can be considered a taste of what's to come.

Wyruz line-up 2011:

Vegar Larsen – Vocals and guitar

Kim Nybakken – Guitar

Per-Kristian Skogli – Bass

Kenneth Skårholen – Drums  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wyruz">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
