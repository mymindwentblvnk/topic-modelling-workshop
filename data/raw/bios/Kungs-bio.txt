Valentin Brunel (born 17 December 1996), better known by his stage name Kungs, is a French house music DJ, record producer and musician. His collaboration with Cookin' on 3 Burners titled "This Girl" reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 2016.

Valentin started his musical career with a djembe gifted by his parents to him at the age of five. Valentin grew up listening to rock and roll classics with his father, including The Who and The Kooks. Discovering a passion for electronic music in his teenage years, Kungs became interested in melodic sounds and crafted timbres led by a dominant vocal. By the age of seventeen he had begun creating melodies using his own instruments. Valentin then began sharing remixes across online social networks. His remixes of "Jamming" by Bob Marley and the Wailers and "West Coast" by Lana Del Rey featuring new vocals from Molly both reached several million plays on SoundCloud and YouTube. Kungs's remix of Lost Frequencies' "Are You with Me" achieved more than 16 million views on YouTube. He released his first extended play This Girl in 2016 following his remix of Cookin' on 3 Burners "This Girl", which reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 2016. He has since released a single called "Don't You Know" featuring Jamie N Commons.
