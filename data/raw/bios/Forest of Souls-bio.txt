Forest of Souls were founded by Denis Barjettas (Bass Guitar) in the summer of 1994. By September the group included Wilfrid Rodel (drums), JÃ©rome Deres (Vocal, Guitar) and soon after Georges Nogueira (Keyboards) joined. The first demo tape "War and Poetry" was self produced and 300 copies (tapes) were on sale during October/November 1994, all copies were sold quickly. Another 1500 copies (MCD) were produced for spring 1995 by Adipocere records. Towards the end of 1995, Jerome Deres decided to quit playing the guitar to concencerate on vocals and lyrics. At this stage a new member joined, Ferederic Mariotti (guitar). During that time Adipocere suggested the recording of a first album. The album was created during 1996 and recorded in February 1997. In September 1997, 3500 copies (Digipack Version) of "Contes Et Legendes D'Efeandyl" were produced and immediately sold out. In spring 1998 another 1000 copies (Crystal Version) were produced and again sold out. Denis Barjettas left the group in April 1998 after a farewell concert in Macon (France). During the same month Nicolas Le Tutour joined the group and did his first gig in May 1998 at the Gibus (Paris). When Adipocere records decided to stop the production, the group self produced the MCD "Huskaleil" and released 1000 copies in January 1999. The MCD was recorded by Fred Rochette (Kalisia, Nells, Fifty One, Toxic Twins ...). This gave a new direction to the group in their sound production. By now, the band is preparing a new double album. The forest of souls has not finished yet counting you new copies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Forest+of+Souls">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
