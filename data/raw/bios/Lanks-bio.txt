Lanks is the enigmatic solo electronic project of Melbourne musician, Will Cuming.

While continuing to front his seven-piece band Farrow, Lanks is a mature new side project that has allowed him to play freely with traditional folk storytelling in the modern framework of electronic music; taking parts from Radiohead’s intricate grooves, Bon Iver’s vocal layering and Jamie XX’s famed dead space.

His debut EP is a collection of songs that rises and falls in pictures and words, a project that combines cinematic soundscapes with electronic beats and evocative vocal narratives.

Although Lanks is a solo venture, with the 24-year-old writing, performing and recording the EP using synthesizers, guitars, samples and flutes over an intensive three month period, the live sets expand to include three other band members.

Lanks debut EP is available digitally on Bandcamp and iTunes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lanks">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
