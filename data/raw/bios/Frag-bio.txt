From the artist's myspace page:

"most of the time i sample parts of song that i think are catchy or funny. sometimes the clips compliment one another, sometimes they don't. if you don't like the way i do things, that's great. i never really put serious effort into my music, although i do usually enjoy the outcomes...sometimes i freestyle, but my mind tends to wander and i usually float onto strange topics and use certain phrases repeatedly. i am not on drugs or mentally disabled.

i probably wouldn't make a myspace if not for the fact that i could post music. if you get a kick out of it, let me know, 'cause that gives me +1 feelgood points. if you think it's the worst thing to ever happen to music, let me know too, because that also makes the feeling good occur." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Frag">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
