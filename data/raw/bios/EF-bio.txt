EF is a five-piece band from Gothenburg, Sweden. It all started in May 2003, and soon they stood in a small basement and created quite heavy music. It didn't take long for them to find that melodies, emotions and explosions were more interesting.

During the first 3 years they recorded and released 4 CD-R demos and began playing in various locations around Sweden. In the summer of 2005 they were contacted by US label Raise the Red Flag. They decided to co-op, and a full length album was released during 2006.

First European tour took place during 3 weeks in October/November 2005. They  did 16 shows.

First proper release was the 2-track 7" released by independent label Jezebel Recordings in November 2005.

The debut full-length album was released in May 2006 by Swedish label And the Sound Records.
It was followed up with a 12-day European tour.

It was also licensed to Japan-based label Thomason Sound (a division of Inpartmaint) for a July 5th release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/EF">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
