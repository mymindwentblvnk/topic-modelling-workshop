The group's history went back to the late summer of 2004 - originally called 'AssBest'. The original lineup was: Cezary 'Cezar' Wisniewski, Bartek 'Marshall' Maruszak, Tomasz 'Doman' Domanski and Tomasz 'Mlody' Kowalski. It all came up from the passion for music, playing hard and having fun with guitars and tons of booze. Band played first gigs in the year 2005. At the end of 2005 they changed their name to T.A.Z and then by the spring of 2006 with Buczek on the bass and Burna on drums recorded 'SuperDEMOn' demo CD at Black Bottle Records studio in Torun (tracklist: 'Welcome', 'Bol Jak Maszyna', 'Expiry of The Deadline'). Group was awarded many times e.g. second place in first Songweavers contest (http://www.songweavers.com) or even individually e.g. Mlody as the best guitarist of Hard Rock Festival in Deczno 2006. In the late autumn of 2007 with Krystus (dr) they managed to experience their independent Cold Metal Fury Tour playing along with: Imperious Rex (California, U.S.A.), Retribution and Full Metal Jacket. 'Schemata of Decomposition' is their first full-lenght album - recorded and mixed at Black Bottle Rec. in the summer of 2008.
