Formed in March 2007, Violence from Within tries to mix together all the music styles they are keen on. 
After several live performances and 4 songs recorded (3 recorded with their own means), the band decided to record in September 2008 their first album in the Jack Studio's in Belgium.
The first album "Reminiscence" (released in November 2009) is now available, contact us for more informations. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Violence+from+Within">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
