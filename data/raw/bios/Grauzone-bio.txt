Grauzone was an 80's Swiss band composed of 3 musicians : Marco Repetto and two brothers, Stephan Eicher and Martin Eicher. At the end of 1979 Marco Repetto (drums) and GT (bass) left the Punk band Glueams, to form together with Martin Eicher (guitar, vocals, synthesizer) a new band called Grauzone. Martin had already supported Glueams on their single mental. They gave their first concert in March 1980 at the club Spex in Berne, Switzerland. Martin's brother Stephan Eicher (guitar, synthesizer) and Claudine Chirac (saxophone) supplemented the group temporarily in live appearances and recordings.
After ten concerts, four singles and an album the group split up at the end of 1982. GT and Marco Repetto formed together with the former Glueams guitarist Martin Pavlinec and the drummer Dominique Uldry, the band „Missing Link“, later „Eigernordwand“. GT supplemented the futurism oriented performance group „Red Catholic Orthodox Jewish Chorus “ around performance artist Edy Marconi, in which occasionally Marco Repetto also played. Later the group changed their name to „I Suonatori“. Stephan Eicher started a successful solo career. 1988 published Martin Eicher his solo-EP „Spellbound Lovers“. Marco Repetto started in 1989 a new career as Techno and Ambient DJ, musician and producer (a.o. mittageisen v2). The band is most famous for their 1981 hit "Eisbär" ("Polar Bear"), which was later covered by the French band Nouvelle Vague. The single went to #12 in Germany and #6 in Austria.


After leaving the group, Stephan Eicher embarked on a solo career in France.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grauzone">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
