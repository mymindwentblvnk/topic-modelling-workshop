The Arm And Sword Of A Bastard God made their four track debut on the split with Coffins. Similar in style to both Graves At Sea and Coffins with some added dirt n grime production wise and insanely pissed gutteral vocals, The Arm & Sword... are among the best new bands to come from the barren sunburnt wastelands outside LA. (2007)
