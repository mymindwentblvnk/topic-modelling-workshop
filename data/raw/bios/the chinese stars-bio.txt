The Chinese Stars are an American band from Providence, Rhode Island formed from the ashes of Arab on Radar and Six Finger Satellite. Their music has been put under the noise rock/dance category, but could best be described as having solid funk basslines, 4-on-the-floor dance beats and very trebly vocals and guitar work. Singer Eric Paul provides somewhat disturbing vocals, viewed by most fans as an exercising of past demons.

Eric Paul and Craig Kureck before the bands collapse were the driving force behind Arab On Radar and likewise Richard Ivan Pelletier was the former drummer of Six Finger Satellite and, after 6FS disbanded, joined The Chinese Stars on bass.

Their name is a reference to a fad in the eighties over Shuriken throwing stars from Japan, and the effect they had on terrified parents. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Chinese+Stars">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
