With an armoury of releases stretching from Metalheadz to Spearhead to V records to Shogun and, together with Bailey, as one of the founders of legendary London D&B night Soul In Motion, Need For Mirrors requires little introduction.

After moving to the UK from his New Zealand home in 2003, Joe Moses created his Need For Mirrors project in 2010 and a year later formed his own label, Zoltar, a platform that allowed him to promote his passion for vinyl and high-quality artwork.

Need For Mirrorsâ€™ relentless output of excellent, original material together with a slew of remixes & collaborations has secured his reputation as a major contributor to the cutting edge of Drum & Bass.
