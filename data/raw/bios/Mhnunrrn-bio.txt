Mhnunrrn was formed by Klat Ba (Holomr√°z, Fonnia) in 2010. The band's first two releases, splits with Kruh and Uruk-Hai, featured (instrumental) black metal material. After, the project transgressed into a more black metal / (harsh) noise orientated style. The name Mhnunrrn is based on prehistoric runes and is in the eyes of Klat Ba a word for success and satisfaction. The logo is simply a calligraphic record of this word, created by Klat Ba himself. Klat Ba is, next to a musician, also a painter and graphical artist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mhnunrrn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
