There is more than one artist with the name "Razorhail":

1. RazorHail is a rock/metal band formed in Orpington in 2011.

Originally known as Burning Justice, the group changed their name in 2012 along with a lineup change (with drummer Ozzie Evans moving to bass guitar). Due to their young age, gigging had been a problem at the start of their career with school performances being the main stage for their performances. Originally without a vocalist, the band recruited vocalist Catie Owen in July 2012. Members of the band are also in a punk rock band called Atomic 66, and another band called Little Resistance.

Lineup:
Catie Owen - lead vocals
Paul Williams - lead guitar
Josh Church - rhythm guitar
Ozzie Evans - bass guitar
Jamie Church - keyboards, synthesizers
Lewis Burke - drums
