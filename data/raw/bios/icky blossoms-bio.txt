Icky Blossoms are a dancy electronic, blissrock  band from Omaha, Nebraska, formed by Nebraska musician Derek Pressnall (flowers forever, Tilly and the Wall) and Los Angeles's Nik Fackler (Indreama). The band, if you can call them that, is more or less a collective collaboration of artists throughout the country, with Pressnall and Fackler working with such musicians as Sarah Bohling, J.J. Idt, and Jacob Thiele.

Icky Blossoms played their first live shows in the spring of 2011, at which time the band had plans to release some split albums and 7" releases with unnamed artists. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Icky+Blossoms">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
