In Cripta is a one man neo-avantgarde black metal band  formed on the freezing shores of the Black Sea in 2009, playing a brand of extremely experimental black metal. 

Featuring bone-chilling guitar riffs, skull-smashing percution blasts, harsh demonic vocals along with angelic clean vocals and a slew of traditional Wallachian instruments, In Cripta sets out to destroy the very boundaries of music and imposes a grim, bitter atmosphere of fear, misanthropy, desperation and mental torture.

In Cripta's debut album was released in early 2009 and it was titled Krapat a Kripta, which led to a record deal with Bezna Productions. 

After the release of Krapat a Kripta, In Cripta immediately clamped shut the crypt's entrance and started working on the second album, which is expected to breach the boundaries of the genre even further.

In August 2009, In Cripta released a double EP, consisting of "...Racnind cele mai cumplite blasfemii" and "Cantece din alte planuri".
