Immoralist is a downtempo deathcore band located in Los Angeles, California. The band is a collective group of members, featuring Davis Rider on vocals. Seen as one of the pioneering bands of the raw beatdown side of deathcore, Immoralist has managed to release one EP and one debut full-length since their “unholy” union in 2012. See what I did there?

Their first EP, titled “Widowmaker,” was received with great success. The EP was released in 2013 under We Are Triumphant record company with a total of six crushing tracks. It would be another three long years until they would finally release their official full-length album. 2016 came and “Unholy” was finally released upon the world. Many teasers and singles led up to its release, creating a lot of hype. Luckily, the album lived up to its expectations and more, as Immoralist had carefully crafted their masterpiece Unholy.
