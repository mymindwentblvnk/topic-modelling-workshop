Driven by brothers Jake and Pete Adams, Valkyrie draws from pre-metal style to create a rich and earthy heavy rock sound. They formed in summer 2002 in Rockbridge County, Virginia as a three-piece consisting of vocalist/guitarist Jake Adams, bassist Eric Seaman, and drummer Luke Shafer. In 2004 Jake's brother Pete was introduced on second guitar and soon after, a five song demo was recorded at a local college radio station. Shafer soon departed and was replaced by Mike Hoke on drums and a new demo, Sunlight Shines, and a split 7" with VOG were recorded. Seaman and Hoke parted ways with the band at the end of 2004 and were replaced by bassist Nick Crabill and drummer Nic McInturff (Napking, Stifling). This line-up recorded the eponymous debut album, which was released by Ric Bennett of Starchild's Twin Earth Records. In early 2006 Valkyrie again parted ways with its rhythm section and recruited current bassist Will Barry-Rec (Hit by a Hearse, Accursed Dawn) and drummer Gary Isom (Spirit Caravan, Pentagram). This lineup played numerous festivals throughout the United States, including the final Emissions from the Monolith Fest in Austin, TX, and the long-running Stoner Hands of Doom festival in Phoenix, AZ. Isom and Valkyrie parted ways in mid 2007 and Valkyrie recruited veteran drummer Warren Hawkins (Big Dixie, Devil Take The Hindmost, Mass Sabbath). In 2008 Valkyrie released their second album, "Man of Two Visions" on the band's own label, Noble Origin. Kreation Records, of Seattle, Washington, released both the S/T and "Man of Two Visions" on 12" vinyl in 2007 and 2008. In 2008, Pete joined Relapse Records recording artist Baroness and began to tour on a nearly full-time basis. In July of 2010 Meteorcity Records (Obsessed, Nebula, Atomic Bitchwax) re-released both the S/T and Man of Two Visions albums in CD format. In March of 2012, Alan Fary (Earthling, Lost at Sea) joined the band on bass and started writing their 3rd full-length album "Shadows" which was released May of 2015 on Relapse Records.
