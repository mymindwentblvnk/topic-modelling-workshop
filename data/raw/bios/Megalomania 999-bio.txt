Megalomania 999 is a Danish death metal band from Odense, Denmark formed in 2005. Though the concept of the band was already shaped in 1992 it took 13 years to complete the line-up and demanded four years of isolated work to write their debut album "The Thoughtprovoking Theatre", released May 12 2007 by Cutting Edge Records.

On September 9 2009 (the symbolic date for Megalomania 999) they released their second full-length album entitled "Rebirth" through Gateway Music. The title and the cover depicts the changes of Megalomania 999 while setting out to conquer the world.
