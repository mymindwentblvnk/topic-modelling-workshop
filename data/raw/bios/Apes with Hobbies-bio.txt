Based in London, England, Apes With Hobbies is the work of amateur guitarist and songwriter Jason Gorman. A software developer and patron of the Bletchley Park Trust, Gorman has been playing guitar and writing music for 24 years, but has only recently started to record and release original material.

AWH's music draws from an eclectic mix of progressive and extreme metal, electronica, ambient, classical and Nu Jazz, with influences including Zappa, Meshuggah, Devin Townsend, Dream Theater, Steve Vai, Napalm Death, Darkane, David Sylvian, Gary Numan, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Thomas Dolby, Tangerine Dream, Ravel and Debussy.

Gorman describes his music as "Space Metal", and it often mixes extreme metal styles and timbres with a layered synth ambience, though some of his tracks are executed entirely using synthesizers.
