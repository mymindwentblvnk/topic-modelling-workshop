There are two groups named Keloid.

1) Keloid is a visual kei influenced group from madrid, Spain.

Keloid was made from the rests of Müder Träum:ER, visual kei style band with the bad luck always around it.

Keloid was formed by Hotaru (vocals), Audrey (Bass), Cal (guitar) and Hohu (drums). Together, they tried to make something after a lot of years of effort with no results. But again fate hitted them. Cal and Hohu abbandoned because of the fact of musical and personal differences, just a pair of weeks before an important live festival (God Save the Lolita Vol.1). But even so, Keloid performed in that live thanks to an improved support band.

Right now, with the support band as official members, Keloid is gonna release their first Demo CD called 'ANTIBIO' and will performance in both Barcelona and Madrid editions of the Second Japan Rock festival.



2) Keloid was formed in 1998, originally as a hard rock band, but guitarist Harley Reillyand drummer Greg Yadao began to create a more aggressive style by blending hardcore with heavy metal. After having a more complex format of arrangements, key changes, and a new bassist and lead vocalist, Bryan Patton, they considered themselves a true heavy metal band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Keloid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
