Why the name Fumigation and the obsession with insects, rodents and chemicals?

Today's metal scene lacks bands with a constant theme, or at least an interesting one. Through this void enters Fumigation. The theme of insects, rodents and chemicals is entertaining, insightful, and humorous all at the same time. From phobias to infestations, harborages to feeding habits, Fumigation will dissect the situation and select the best method of control. This method usually comes in the form of groove laden death metal.
