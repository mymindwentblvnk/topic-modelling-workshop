Whitemour was founded in the year 2006 in Sein√§joki Finland as a project of two men, when founding members, Jani and Miika, wanted to play for their own amusement. With electric drums and guitar they had their fun, but after a few short months of playing they became more and more eager to set up a real band.

Since 2013 summer, the band has broken up. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Whitemour">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
