Paul Andrews (born 17 May 1958),  better known by his stage name Paul Di'Anno, is a British singer and songwriter who was the original lead vocalist for English heavy metal band Iron Maiden, from 1977 to 1981.


Paul Di'Anno began his professional musical career singing with Iron Maiden in 1978. His style has been described as more punk-influenced than Iron Maiden's following vocalist Bruce Dickinson.  Di'Anno left the band after two albums, the reasons for so vary between sources; either leaving by his own will or being sacked due to excessive drug and drinking habits with a conflicting personality .

Despite his short tenure in the band, Paul Di'Anno is seen as a major factor in the early development of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) movement.

After this, Paul moved onto various projects such as Di'Anno, Battlezone and Killers with varying commercial success. Now, his band is simply known as Paul Di'Anno.

In his post-Maiden career, Di'Anno has issued numerous albums over the years, as both a solo artist and as a member of such bands as Gogmagog, Di'Anno's Battlezone, Praying Mantis, Killers, and Rockfellas.
