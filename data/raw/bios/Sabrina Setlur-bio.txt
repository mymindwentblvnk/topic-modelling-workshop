Sabrina Setlur (born January 10, 1974 in Frankfurt am Main, to Indian immigrants) is a German rapper. Her birth name "Jayanthi" (after Krishnan's mother) was too difficult for her teachers and classmates to pronounce, so her parents changed it to Sabrina.

In 1993, at the age of 19, she was signed for the German Hip-Hop group "RÃ¶delheim Hartreim Projekt" and record label, after rapping to Dr Dre's "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang".

She first entered the German charts in 1995 with the Hip-Hop project "Schwester S" ("Sister S") and the album "S ist soweit". In 1997 she followed up with her solo debut album "Die neue S-Klasse", which topped the German charts and earned her an ECHO and a Comet award for "Best Female Artist", pushed by the success of her number 1 single "Du Liebst Mich Nicht".

In 2004 she tried to represent Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest, but in the national preselection her song "Liebe" failed to reach TOP3, so her placing in unknown.
