Sacram were founded in 1999 by John and Paschalis. Born in the depths of Athens, Sacram exploded onto the metal scene in 1999 with their debut demo album, Desert Sea. Desert Sea became soon recognized as one of the most eminent demo works of its time. Despite the unpolished and rough production, critics and metal enthusiasts recognized a rare quality in Sacram's sound.
After years of experimentation the new Sacram sound has been forged through countless practice sessions, into a solid energy wave that strikes the audience as a great live experience. This energy is evident in the latest Sacram album, the self-financed miniCD Far Away.
Far Away is even more darker, more emotional, more intense and more skilfully played than its predecessor. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sacram">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
