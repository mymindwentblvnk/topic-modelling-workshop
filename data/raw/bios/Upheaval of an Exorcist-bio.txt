Hailing from Sudbury Ontario, we are a six piece deathcore band that only strives for the top. Having only begun in December of 2007, the band has suffered many lineup changes from the beginning until present. With the current lineup having been together since May of 2008, the band grows quickly with only intentions of moving forward and fucking shit up along the way. Upheaval of an Exorcist consists of J.B and Jay of Seed the Omen, Yves Dupuis of Wrong Formula, Remi Courty , Kevin and Kyle of First in Defiance. Consisting of chaotic blast patterns, overwhelming breakdowns and the vocals that will make your eyes bleed, this band will not stop until they make it to the top.
