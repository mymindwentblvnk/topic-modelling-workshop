Noise for Pretend looks like your average indie pop group but sounds nothing like one. Nor do they sound very noisy. A Portland, OR-based trio comprised of standup bassist and lead vocalist Esperanza Spalding, guitarist and vocalist Benjamin Workman, and drummer Christian Cochran, Noise for Pretend instead plays jazz-influenced pop noir, taking cues from Django Reinhardt and Astrud Gilberto far more often than Sonic Youth and Superchunk. They made their recorded debut on a split release with the like-minded Blanket Music in 2001 on Hush. At the time of release, Spalding was 16 years old, belying her mature, confident, studied voice and skillful bass playing. The group's full-length debut followed before the end of the year.
