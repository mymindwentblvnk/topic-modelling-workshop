Originating out of Montreal, The Lovely Feathers' refreshingly whimsical second album Hind Hind Legs is quirky, sunny and engaging. The album's strange yet lovable indie-pop songs, replete with sometimes silly, always captivating lyrics, shout-a-long choruses and clever "bet you didn't see that coming" rhythm changes makes it an instant favorite. 

Their third album, Fantasy of the Lot, was released in Canada on June 2, 2009 and in the US on August 19, 2009.
