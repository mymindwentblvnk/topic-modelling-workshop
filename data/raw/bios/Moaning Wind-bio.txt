Moaning Wind was a Swedish melodic death metal band who were active in the first half of the 90's. They recorded one demo and one album before leaving the scene. After splitting up three of the members went on to form the metal / hardrock hybrid Tailpipe. In the early days they were known under the names Succubus and Malignum. Their one and only album was recorded in July 1995 at Studio Fredman in Gothenburg but the label didn't release the album until May 1997. The band was tired of things and decided to form a new band to get away from the contract. They also changed their musical direction slightly to play more classic heavy metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moaning+Wind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
