Neural FX is a progressive metal band founded in 2007 in Monterrey, Nuevo León, México with the ideology of creating new and innovative music incorporating the varied influences of its members.

Because of the excellent musical and personal connection of René Montt, Antonio Vázquez, León Tinoco and Adolfo Torres, they assembled the solid material that they presented in their debut album, and set out together on a music trip, becoming part of very important events of the rock scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Neural+Fx">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
