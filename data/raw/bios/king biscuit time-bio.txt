King Biscuit Time was the first solo project of Steve Mason, lead singer of The Beta Band. 
1998 saw the release of his King Biscuit Time "Sings" Nelly Foggit's Blues in "Me and the Pharaohs" EP on Regal. The No Style EP followed in 2000.
Post Beta Band, Mason was signed to No Style Records, an imprint of Alan McGee's Poptones label. The single C I AM 15 (featuring Topcat) was released in September 2005, with the follow-up KwangChow and debut album Black Gold following in 2006.

Shortly after the release of Black Gold, Mason announced that he would not be making any more music. Thankfully he has gone on to release more records, initially under the name Black Affair and now as himself. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/King+Biscuit+Time">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
