Suuns have no doubt ingested a lot of art rock, the Montreal group's minimalist rhythms are equally informed by Joy Division, Suicide and Can, often wrapped in a noisy squall of droning guitars and pulsing synths. Add to this Ben Shemie's breathy, paranoid sing/speak, and there are times that it seems like Suuns are about to drive over a sonic cliff. But there's actually a great sense of restraint at play. We were enveloped in Suuns' dark and thrilling post-punk from the first listen, never to return.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Suuns">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
