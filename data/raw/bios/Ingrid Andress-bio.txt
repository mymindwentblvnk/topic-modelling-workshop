Ingrid Elizabeth Andress (born September 21, 1991) is an American country music singer.

"A country pop rookie who can write a chorus like Sia," (PAPER), Ingrid Andress is set to release her debut album Lady Like on March 27 via Warner Music Nashville/Atlantic Records. Featuring the title-track she performed on Late Night with Seth Meyers, the project will also include her nearly Top 10 country radio single “More Hearts Than Mine.” The “elegantly written” (New York Times) ballad, which she performed on NBC’s TODAY, earned Andress her first entry on Billboard’s all-genre Hot 100 chart and made history as the only debut from a solo-female to crack the Country Airplay Top 20 in 2019. Highlighted in ELLE’s 2019 Women in Music issue, the Billboard Chartbreaker received early critical acclaim from People, Rolling Stone, Us Weekly, NPR, Variety, Vulture, PAPER, The Tennessean, HITS and many more. The accomplished singer/songwriter, who has penned songs for artists including Bebe Rexha, Charli XCX, FLETCHER and Dove Cameron, continues to hone her skills writing with heavy hitters in the music community like Sam Hunt, Alicia Keys and Tori Kelly. She’ll hit the road this spring on Dan + Shay’s The (Arena) Tour and help Thomas Rhett kick off his Center Point Road tour in May before joining Tim McGraw’s massive 2020 Here on Earth stadium tour July through September.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ingrid+Andress">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
