Y.A.S. is Mirwaïs Ahmadzaï and Yasmine Hamdan. YAS is the first international Electro project that places the Arabic language at the centre of pop culture! Leading the project is Mirwaïs, born in Afghanistan, he has already contributed to several duos; Daniel Darc (French rock icon), Juliette (from Juliette et les indépendants) and Madonna. He has been rated among the five greatest contemporary producers (alongside Timbaland and Dr Dre) by Esquire Magazine. He is better known as an artist, musician and producer rather than a celebrity although he has often been under the spotlights.
Here Mirwaïs comes back with a project close to his image 100% artistic, Pop and radical. Pop as in popular, accessible to everyone and avant-garde. Electro and Arabic, enriched with experience, he continues to imagine the future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Y.A.S.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
