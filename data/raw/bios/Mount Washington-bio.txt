Mount Washington is the band formerly known as Washington, hailing from the town of Tromsø in dark, northern Norway, bot now residing in Berlin, Germany.

Founding members Rune Simonsen, Andreas Høyer and Esko Pedersen grew up in Tromsø together. They had already been making music for several years when they formed Washington and travelled some hundred miles south to record their début EP (2004) in Trondheim. Since then the band have released three LPs and toured all over Europe. In 2011, coinciding with the recording of their fourth album, Washington became Mount Washington, in order to mark a new beginning. Their first album as Mount Washington is the self-titled Mount Washington, released in early 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mount+Washington">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
