Inlaid Rust is an Experimental Black Metal studio
project from California, USA, scheming circa 2007.

"Amid irregular Black Metal behavior and scooping Doom drones,
listener can find Industrial-Noise scarring an Odd-Ambient framework.
The act ends as an unorthodox look at The End through electronic eyes."


'MMCCX: The Inanimate Age' will be the act's first LP.
The album will be released free of charge on sharing and torrent sites.
