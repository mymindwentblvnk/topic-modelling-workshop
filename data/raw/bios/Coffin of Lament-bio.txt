A death metal band from HÃ¸nefoss, Norway, formed as Interment in 1990 although their first release was the demo-tape Sathanas Oratorium in 1992 under the moniker Energumen. A year later they released a Rehearsal tape. In 1993 they changed their name to Coffin Of Lament and released a demo-tape named Gwrach-Y-Rhibyn. Later the same year the band became known as Faun, playing a more black metal-oriented sound, in contrast to their previous death metal releases. In 1995, the band saw its final form, named Vulture Lord and playing black/thrash metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Coffin+Of+Lament">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
