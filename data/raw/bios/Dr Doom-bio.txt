A blend of grind, death metal, black metal and some noisy core.

It all started our for Dr Doom somewhere in February 2006. Being on the road with Greyline, Mart and JB started talking about their mutual interest for breathtaking blastbeats, d-beat and “dark intentions”. This is where Dr Doom saw daylight. The founding members of Dr Doom soon started to look for the perfect drummer to accomplish a solid base. Joris (also member of Elexorien) was the perfect fit.

With this music comes along a singer whose performance gives an extra load to the music. Eli, former singer of My Great Devastator, is known for his crazy live performance. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DR+Doom">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
