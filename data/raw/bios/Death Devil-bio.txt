DEATH DEVIL was an indie NVHM hailing from Japan from early 90's and a short reunion concert for the wedding reception of one classmember in 2010.
With the cult for obscure/indie metal bands such like X, Saver Tiger, or Tokyo Yankees and respect for the well know acts like: Anthem, Loudness or Ｂｏｗ Ｗｏｗ (mask and demon-styled white wig image for the band leader), but the most influental band must be one of the strongest screams from USA - speed/thrash Death Angel.
DEATH DEVIL was all female band (just like SHOW-YA) formed by the high school classmates.

Band line up:
Sawako Yamanaka/Katherine - lead guitar/vocals, instruments: Epiphone "1958" Korina "Flying V" & Gibson "SG" (Solid Guitar; early model from 1960's)
Norimi Kawaguchi/Christina - rhythm guitar/backing vocals, instrument: B.C. Rich "Warlock" series guitar
.../Della - bass guitar/backing vocals
.../Jane - drums and percussions
