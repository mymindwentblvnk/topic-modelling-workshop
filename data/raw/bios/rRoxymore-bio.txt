rRoxymore is a house and techno rule-breaker. The Berlin-based French producer makes music that feels at home in the club at 4 a.m., but her productions and DJ mixes pull in a diverse set of influences, whether it's far-flung jazz or woozy psychedelia. Starting out on conceptual artist Planningtorock's label Human Level in 2012, she's since released with a slew of forward-thinking electronic labels, including CÃ³meme and Huntleys & Palmers, and remixed The Knife. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/rRoxymore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
