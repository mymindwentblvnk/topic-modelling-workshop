Biography
NekraD was formed in late 1999 by the original members:-

Kawi :- Guitars
Dore :- Guitars
Along :- Vocal
Auks :- Bass
Mat :- Keyboards
Meor :- Drums

In the year 2000, NekraD unleashed their debut demo "The Realm of Darkness", and later, after their first live performance on Ipoh's Loudblast Anthems II, the band disappeared under the ruins. Few of the bandmembers left for personal circumstances, and another few were involved in a new project "Dead Man Walking".

After 10 years of deafening silence, NekraD again rises with cooperative effort of Mr. Jadam, a prominent producer/musician in Malaysian metal scene, while keeping the alignment onto the old concept of Vampiric/Mystical world phenomenon within extreme symphonic serenades.

NekraD is now back in the studio, conjuring their next awaited release, which will be a split album with the world reknown Vociferation Eternity.
