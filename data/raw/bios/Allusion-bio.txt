Allusion is a concept that involves a palette of sounds coming from the instruments that talk about belief, inspiration, greatness, ideologies, abstract views, the world, beauty, darkness and beyond. This concept was given further notice when these musicians came together and what you will hear at our live shows and our work is the continuous passion to create better music and to bring sounds that are as diverse as possible, yet there is a noticeable link to the audiences.
