Hellveto is a one-man symphonic/orchestral pagan black metal band from Ostrołęka, Poland, formed in 1995. L.O.N., the only member of the band, plays all instruments on all albums released by Hellveto to date. He is noted for his productivity, having released 15 full-length albums, as well as several demo's, EP's and compilations. But as if this was not enough, L.O.N is also involved in the one-member bands Blakagir, Sarkel and Winds of Garden. In 2014 he decided to change the band name to Neoheresy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hellveto">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
