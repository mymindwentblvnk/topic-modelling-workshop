The Hackensaw Boys first began playing their joyful blend of old-time and bluegrass-tinged string-band music on the streets of Charlottesville in the autumn of 1999. Far from limiting themselves to the old-time canon, however, the Hackensaws have been first and foremost a band of songwriters. Their music, while drawing upon the spirit of the mountains, is sophisticated and informed by the best elements of punk rock and classic country music. As one reviewer put it: “Imagine the Carter Family meets the Ramones and you begin to get the picture.”

Their current line-up exists of:

Rob 'Mahlon' Bullington: mandolin, guitar, vocals
Jimmy 'The Kooky-Eyed Fox' Stelling: banjo, fiddle, vocals
Jesse 'Baby J' Fiske: upright bass, accordion, harmonica, guitar and vocals
Justin 'Salvage' Neuhardt: charismo, spoons and vocals
Ferd "Four" Moyse: fiddle, upright bass and vocals
Ward 'Cousin Spits' Harrison: guitar and vocals

They are sometimes joined live by founding member Tom 'Pee Paw' Peloso on fiddle, upright bass and vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hackensaw+Boys">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
