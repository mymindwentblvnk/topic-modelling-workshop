There are two artists who use the name "Poke".
Poke was a Swedish electronic triphop act which released the album 'Sassy' in 1996 on the Swedish record label Substance/Goldhead Music. Members were J.L. (Galactic Production Soldier), Monnie (Singer Superstar) and Mikeadelica (Universal Scratch Hero). 
The music is pretty original with influences from acts like Portishead, Massive Attack, Morcheeba, Tricky and The Future Sound of London. Parallels to Star Wars, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and video games can also be found in the music and lyrics.

POKE can also refer to the music of D. Kent Watson and Eric Haven (Property Of Kent and Eric). Kent would record song ideas with guitar, synth, and his voice, and send them to Eric, who would finish the songs with electronic production. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Poke">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
