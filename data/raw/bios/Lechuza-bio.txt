The band formed in late 08' but the idea was started around 06' with Leon and Juan sharing guitar riffs and ideas on where to lead the band. We then picked up Aaron on bass then finally came Jasmin and Jessica to complete the current lineup. Subjects we cover range from Woman's rights, Pro-immigration reform, Anti-authoritarianism, Equality, Resistance, Peace, drug-abuse, abusive/unhealthy relationships...etc. We share similar interests in what we believe, Our taste in music varies from person to person which is what gives us that certain sound we have. It might sound familiar but hopefully not to the point of copying. As of late May 2010 we put out a self titled DIY demo with the three songs on this profile if you'd like a copy we usually have them at shows or send us your address and we can mail something out (http://www.myspace.com/noiseguerrillas) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lechuza">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
