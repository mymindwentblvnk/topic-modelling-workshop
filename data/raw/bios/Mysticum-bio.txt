Mysticum is an industrial black metal band from Asker, Norway. They have released a few demos, a couple of splits, most notably with Ulver and Audiopain, and 2 full-length albums, namely "In the Streams of Inferno" and in 2014 "Planet Satan".

"In the Streams of Inferno" was supposed to be released on the infamous "Deathlike Silence Productions" label, run by the godfather of Black Metal, Euronymous, but because of the obvious history that had occurred this has never happened. However, in 1996 "Full Moon Productions" picked up the Industrial Black Metal album and released it.

The album got a remastered re-release in 2013, featuring two additional tracks and a bonus DVD with several live shows of Mysticum. It was also released on pure white vinyl, along with brand new artwork and liner notes by the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mysticum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
