Stone of Erech is a musical project formed by Hermod (Cyhiriaeth, Carcharoth, Dhaubgurz) and Karn.
The band started in 1998 under the moniker of Morgoth. Hermod, creator and only member of the band, records a 8 songs demo, never released because of the lack of good sound.
Times goes on and Stone of Erech is almost forgotten. But 10 years after, Hermod re-records 3 songs from the first demo, plus a new song, with the help of Karn, conforming the "Stone of Erech" EP, in order to re-introduce the band and it's reborn spirit.
