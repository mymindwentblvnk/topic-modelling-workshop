There are 4 bands with the name From Hell:

1. American hardcore band.
Since the over-awesome See You Next Tuesday is still on hiatus this'll have to do. Side project from their Drummer, they describe it as Trash/Crust/D-beat. These guys have shared the stage with band like Have Heart and such.


2.Death Metal Band from Brazil.
Death Metal was never common place. Persists the second fact which your intensity and force were never challenged. It is a style that puts in suspension the expectations that appear of the usual ear, but it is also a select underworld that demands to be overcome permanently. In that stage some were quickly forgotten, other fully admired by their works and attitudes. From Hell dared to face such borders. Formed in 2004, From Hell is always a group of musicians of similar thought about the style that met to reach and to take the extreme levels of brutality ahead, in reverence to Death Metal's old pillars. And the hell took form.

3.There is also a band called From Hell from Japan. They formed from the disbanding of Hellchild.They released an self titled EP in 2003 and a full length called Empty Words in 2004.

4. From Hell is an Indonesian black metal duo that blends progressive, atmospheric, melodic and overall experimental elements with oriental themed black metal.
