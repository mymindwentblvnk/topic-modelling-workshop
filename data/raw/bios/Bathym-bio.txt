There are two bands called Bathym.

1. A death metal / black metal band from New Brighton, Pennsylvania that formed in 1989.  A year earlier, they were known as Sathanas and then decided to call themselves Bathym.  As Bathym, they released two demos called Rehearsal/Demo 1989 and 1990 Rehearsal in 1990.  In 1991, they released a third demo entitled Into Darkness.  Also in 1991, they released an EP called Demonic Force.  In 1992, they disbanded.  The last known lineup consisting of Paul Tucker (vocals, guitar),  Eric Watson (bass) and Bill Smiley (drums) decided to with the 2nd incarnation of Sathanas.

2. Dark ambient from California. Project of Bathym formerly of the NSBM band Perdition. Has released eight demos and two split demos. Self described as "dark experimental/ritualistic music", musically comparable to Boyd Rice and When, but more psychoticly evil.  He has begun using the Perdition name again - he says all further Bathym recordings will be done as Perdition.
