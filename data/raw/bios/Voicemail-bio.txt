Voicemail is a Jamaican dancehall trio hailing from Kingston, Jamaica. Its members Craig Jackson, Kevin Blaire and O'Neil Edwards (â€  May 26, 2010) started their recording career in 1999, and gained traction in 2003 when they signed a contract with VP Records. They are most famous for their upbeat, catchy dancing anthems, of which they've written dozens in the last decade. O'Neil Edwards was ambushed and shot in front of his house on May 10, 2010 and deceased two weeks later in the hospital. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Voicemail">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
