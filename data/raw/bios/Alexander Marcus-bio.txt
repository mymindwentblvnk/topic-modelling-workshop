Alexander Marcus (born 24 December 1979) is a persona of the German house music producer Felix Rennefeld. He has become popular throughout Germany after a series of videos he produced and displayed on youtube.

Rennefeld was born in Berlin. After his parents were divorced Rennefeld lived with his grandmother in the country, where he took part in the popular children's dance group "Edelweißchen". At eighteen he went to the USA and lived in New York and Miami, and while there experienced international and electronic music. It was here that he formed the idea to mix the two music styles. He has been living in Berlin since 2005. On 6 June 2008 he released his debut album Electro Lore with Kontor Records, which included guest contributions by Manny Marc and Frauenarzt. 

Style:

Rennefeld's music is a mixture of modern electronic club music and folk music, which he has named 'Electro Lore', a combination of 'electro' and 'folklore'.  Alexander Marcus exaggerates many of the clichés present in pop music, and his music videos feature "trashy" objects, such as a recurrent plastic globe called "Globi". Spiegel Online sees the character as a typical example of a return to pop-art social criticism. Never breaking out of character, he leaves the question of whether he is a parody unanswered:
“ The idea that the guy might really be as barmy as it seems, remains at least possible.”
