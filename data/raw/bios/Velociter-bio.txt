Velociter was formed in 2011 by drummer Thomas Halborg Madsen and guitarist Bastian Reinhold Madsen. Steffen Hagelskj√¶r soon joined playing bass. Half a year went by before Velociter got their singer and guitar player Rasmus Clemmensen and was ready to take off. In 2013 Velociter released their first EP - Hangar Of Doom - online, this was recorded in Death Island Studio. The record had a very old school heavy/thrash approach and got some great reviews from E.G GFRock, Heavymetal.dk and more. With the EP in their back Velociter played a string of shows, among them a show at Metal Magic Afterparty and as opening band for the legendary 80ies thrash metal band Artillery. 
In May 2014 the band added Marika Hyldmar to their lineup. Now playing with two singers the band got a heavier approach to their songwritting and sound. With Marika the band embarked on their first ''mini tour'' that brought them to cities like: Viborg, Herning, Aarhus and Copenhagen. When the tour ended Velociter got ready to enter Death Island Studios once again, to record their second EP entitled ''Heir Of Solitude''. The new EP released physically and digitally on the 20th of April 2015 and features a bonus track mixed, mastered and guested by Mike Wead (Mercyful Fate, King Diamond). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Velociter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
