In the summer 1989, Crash Alley was born when guitarist/vocalist Wayne Estrada, guitarist Eldon 'Big E' Fisher, bassist Phil 'Swil' Brungardt, and drummer Steve Kennedy put together its demo album along with an exciting live show. In Jan. 1990, the debut album 'Crash Alley' was released and received rave reviews from several publications including Kerrang! Magazine. The band toured non-stop across the country playing over 300 shows per year and built a rabid following of hard rock fanatics. From Sept. 1991 thru Jan. 1993, the recording of the 2nd album Loud ‘n’ Ugly debuted a new rhythm section, which sent the band hurtling forward into a new and exciting direction. This approach managed to attract the attention of several record labels and landed the band a major label showcase with Atlantic Records. The non-stop touring continued. In May of 1995, the band would evolve into an industrial, melodic power groove machine with the addition of yet another new rhythm section and the release of the adventurous and experimental Swag album. 

Crash Alley have opened for bands such as, Aerosmith, Pantera, Night Ranger, Quiet Riot, Electric Boys, Hurricane Alice, Britney Fox, Savatage, Enuff Z’nuff, Vinnie Moore, Lizzy Borden, Steppenwolf, Head East, Shotgun Messiah, Lillian Axe, Dokken, Warrant, and Wyzard (w/Aynsely Dunbar,).
