69 Chambers are heavy riffing guitars counterpointed by Nina Treml's pop-oriented vocals, while the driving bass and the blasting drums form a tight and solid wall of sound.

The Swiss rock/metal-threepiece was formed in Zurich by the guitar-playing frontlady in 2001 and soon made a loud impact at the «Universal Breakthru Contest», recorded an EP as well as a video and gave their international debut at the «Pentaport Festival» in Incheon, South Korea amongst reknowned bands like «Muse» and «Testament».
