Dapayk & Padberg are Niklas Worgt and Eva Padberg. They are producing music between minimal and techhouse on their label Mo’s Ferry Prod since 2003. The first album „close up“ (2005) caused a little sensation, when both hit the scene with their spectacular sound: lascivious-velvet-raw voice meets cool-harsh-plastic beats.
Finally after two years, their second album „black beauty“ is out in stores. And the collaboration has not changed since then. Both write in turns or together on lyrics and tinker (as they call it: "frickel") on sounds.
