THE TAMPERER FEAT. MAYA was an Italian-American dance music group consisting of Italian music producers Mario Fargetta & Alex Farolfi, and American singer Maya Days. Later, Giuliano Saglia and GianLuca Mensi would join the project. In 1998, they became famous for their debut single "Feel It", a British number one hit taken from the album "Fabulous". "Feel it" was written by the American team of Steve Gittelman and Jim Dyke and relied heavily on a sample of the Jackson Five hit "Can You Feel It". The album spawned two more singles, "If You Buy This Record Your Life Will Be Better" (based on a sample from Madonna's Material Girl), and the Italy-only release "Step Out", which was later included as a B-side on their fourth and final single, "Hammer to the Heart". The producers also used The Tamperer alias to produce and remix other artists, such as Crystal Waters. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Tamperer+feat.+Maya">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
