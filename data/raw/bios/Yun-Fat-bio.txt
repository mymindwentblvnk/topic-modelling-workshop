This band has transcended extreme metal since its inception. For eight years now Brazilian outfit Yun-Fat has defied the very definition of metal and has successfully blended death metal to grind core and bossa nova. Since the release of their debut, 2007’s “Action Movie Stunts Get To Die” (Torto Fono Gramas), Yun-Fat has been praised for daring to meld technicality, brutality, humor and Brazilian sexiness into a unique sound. Their sophomore effort, “Apocalypse Via Copacabana”, was another band/Jera Cravo production and showcases an even more wild and brutal yet more focused and mature band than before.
