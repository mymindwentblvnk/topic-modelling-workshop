The cold unhealthy days of 1996 saw the climax of Black Metal in south of France . From this gruesome, warlike atmosphere filled with domination, esoterism, and an abhorrence for mercy arised Diamond Eyed Princess. DEP's early days came to life with the help of Overlord Nasty Metatheos of Blessed In Sin (first version of “Lord of Dreams” and “Pagan Rite” recorded with the voice of Nasty).

1998 : Darkhyrys begins elaborating the concept of Diamond Eyed Princess (the story of the Ghamal Kingdom ).

1999/2000 : Release, with the help of Mysticia, of the split-demo with Infect (United to Conquer) under Aura Mystique.
The same year, Horus (bass) and Lwyleina (Keyborads) joined the band. They would then record in 2000, along with Darkhyrys, Diamond Eyed Princess's first opus : “Pagan Rite”.

2001 : Release of “Pagan Rite” under Aura Mystique prods.

2002 :The next year was marked by the arrival of Ghroth as a substitute for Horus, and an evolution of both the concept and the composition of the songs (more in a pagan-metal style).

2004 :The band enters the studios (WOLFSANGEL STUDIO) to record the second opus “Korlguelaal”.
It will be released in 2007.
