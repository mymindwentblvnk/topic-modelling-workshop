Formed in Pescara, Italy in 1979; Unreal Terror managed to mesh NWOBHM and the many other trademarks of Europe's 80's metal movement into their ground breaking 1985 ep titled, “Heavy and Dangerous.” And boy were these four tracks heavy and dangerous indeed. 

The line-up of the ep included:
Vocals- Luciano Palermi
Guitar- Mario Di Donato
Drums- Silvio Canzano
Bass- Ennio Nicolini

Shortly after the ep was released, Mario Di Donato left the band for another one of his projects, Requiem. Giuseppe Continenza filled this absence and the band resumed work on a full length album. In 1986, Hard Incursion was released and the band continued to perform concerts until 1989 (?).

The line-up of Hard Incursion included:
Vocals- Luciano Palermi
Guitar- Giuseppe Continenza
Drums- Silvio Canzano
Bass- Ennio Nicolini

In 1987, Unreal Terror was featured on the “Rock Meets Metal” compilation put out by Ebony Records. The band planned to release a new album titled, “Metal Master”, but the band dissolved and the album never saw the light of day.
