Dark Age is a German melodic death metal band formed in 1995 in Hamburg. Everything began sometime in the year 1994, when Eike Freese, André Schumann and Olli Fliegel rotted themselves together to found a Metal band and maybe someday release an album. André had to take the drumsticks, meanwhile Eike played guitar and shared the vocals with bass-player Olli. Name-giver were the mighty Metallica with the track Dyer's Eve. The style of the music was similar to that of Grindcore/Death Metal and sounded like music produced by bands such as Carcass, Brutal Truth and Cannibal Corpse. The rehearsal-room was the music classroom in their school. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Age">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
