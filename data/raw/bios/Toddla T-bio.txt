Cut yer boy TODDLA T open and you’ll be vapourised by the pure Sheffield, England electronics crackling inside him. The Steel City ‘Bleep’ bubbles right through the blood, brains and musical meat of this dirty rascal’s DJ stints, rerubs and original night-time material. 

Weaned on the teat of bashment from a young age, Mr T rolled through his early years on his hands and knees with ears glued to the speakers of his folks’ hi fi. Making beats, bass, blunts and girls filled his adolescence until he was crowned as inhouse studio boff at Sheffield’s Kenwood Studios at the grand old age of 19.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Toddla+T">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
