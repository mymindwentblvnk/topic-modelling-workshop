Pierre grew up in London and brings the english lyrics and accent to the band as well as playing synthesizers. Simon started as the guitarist and has now taken on the job of playing synthesizers in some songs. Georg is the band's drummer that plays a live drum set combined with a sample pad.
I Heart Sharks are a live playing band, and this is a trait that they emphasize strongly. Their concerts and their recordings are done without the use of sequencers or any kind of playback material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/I+Heart+Sharks">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
