Prince Club (ex-MadKids) are two young dj/producers who have been attracting a certain amount of attention. In less then a year, the two have already released dual EP's, which were instantly supported by industry heavyweights Mowgli, Round Table Knights, Camel, Brodinski, Edu K, Sinden and the whole Discobelle crew. With numerous club and festival gigs under their belts, including Montreal's prestigious electronic music festival, Igloofest, Pikinic Electronik and the recent Nuits Sonores in Lyon, France, Prince Club are quickly securing their position among the Major Leaguers. You can catch their upcoming releases out soon on non-other than Discobelle Records, and many, many more.
