Iron Curtain was a minimal wave band from Santa Barbara, CA, who played regularly in the Los Angeles underground music scene. They were heavily influenced by The Cure, OMD, Joy Division, and Kraftwerk. The band released several records in small quantities even though they had a great fan base, and hence over the years these releases have gained mass cult appeal which has driven the prices of used copies up into the thousands. After several years of searching for Steve Fields (front man for the group), Pylon Records is pleased to bring the entire catalog into print for the first time on CD. Featured on the CD is the cult classic "The Condos", the goth-club-friendly track "Tarantula Scream", and the much-sought-after track "Legalize Heroin", which has a stark resemblance to My Bloody Valentine.
