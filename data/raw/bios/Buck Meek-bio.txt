Buck Meek (born in Wimberley, TX, on 10 July 10 1987) is an American musician best known as the guitarist and backing vocalist of Big Thief. Meek 's eponymous solo album was released in 2018. 

Meek learned his first guitar chords from his mother around the age of six and played jazz manouche and outlaw country as a teen. He graduated from the Berklee College of Music in the late 2000s, finishing just as soon-to-be-collaborator Adrianne Lenker enrolled.

Having relocated to Brooklyn from Boston, Meek ran into a newly arriving Lenker a few years later. They released two EPs as a duo in 2014 -- A-Sides and B-Sides -- before forming Big Thief with bass player Max Oleartchik and drummer James Krivchenia. Meek issued his debut studio EP, Heart Was Beat, in 2015. Among its collaborators were Lenker, Oleartchik, and Mat Davidson, aka Twain.

Meek released his first solo album, Buck Meek, on Austin-based Keeled Scales that May. He later toured his solo material with Twain and opened over dozen shows for solo Jeff Tweedy in 2019.

Forced off the road by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Meek recorded his second solo long-player, Two Saviors, with Davidson, Adam Brisbin (guitar), and Austin Vaughn (drums) as his backing band  (both had contributed to his debut album, as had engineers Phil Weinrobe and Sarlo). The album was released in 2021. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Buck+Meek">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
