A black saga that began Anno Sathanas 2009. The summer was approaching as the three Wan norsemen Isengrim, Aganaroth and Tsjud decided to join their unholy forces. The mutual aim was to celebrate Satan, chaos and the mighty northern darkness.

WAN released their debut album 'Wolves of the North' in 2010 through Abyss Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/WAN">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
