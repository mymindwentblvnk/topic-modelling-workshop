Changed named to Enter the Soil in 2017

Hirsute is a doom metal band based in New Zealand and is the work of a single musician, Justin Chorley. Drawing heavy influence from the pioneers of the doom metal genre during the early 1990's such as Anathema, My Dying Bride and Katatonia, Hirsute displays a clear musical direction, favoring dreary, melancholic atmospheres while maintaining the punch and energy upon which the greater metal genre was founded.
 
In August 2011 came the first official release from Hirsute – the self titled Hirsute EP which was a series of recordings made by Chorley as he began to explore the potential of home recording both as a tool for songwriting and a way to experiment and connect with new audiences. The album was released for free in an effort to spread the band's name as far as possible and generate a fan base in preparation for a commercial release which was to follow. This was a great success with several fans around the world sharing their favorite tracks through YouTube and other social media, and 'watching this space' for what was still to come.
 
In February 2014, 'Still Waiting' was finally unveiled and so far has received an overwhelming response with copies sold to Canada, Germany, Lithuania, Poland and more within the first week of its release, as well as gaining radio airplay in Australia and the US. Since its release, Hirsute has received offers from two small European record labels and interest in both the band and the new album continues to grow. Chorley states he is happy to remain independent for now but “could definitely be swayed if the right offer came along”. Ideas are already circulating for the next album which he says he expects will be much darker than previous releases. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hirsute">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
