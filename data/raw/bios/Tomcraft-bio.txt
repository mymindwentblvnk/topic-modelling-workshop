Established as one of Europe's best Tech-House scenes hitmakers, Thomas Bruckner aka TOMCRAFT has catapulted himself this past year through various charts in different countries. He is specialized in progressive house and progressive trance and is better known for having created the tracks “Loneliness” and “Prosac”, working alongside Eniac.

Tomcraft began working as a DJ in Munich in 1994, shifting between techno and the emerging progressive trance style. The following year, he released his first track, “This Is No House”. He first met in Eniac in 1996, and the two immediately started producing music together, beginning with “Viva”. The same year yielded the track “Prosac”, but this did not achieve success until it was re-released in 2001.

2002 was also the year Tomcraft released “Loneliness”, a progressive vocal track that eventually reached #1 in the UK [1]. The financial success allowed him to found his own record label, Great Stuff Recordings, followed up in 2005 with Craft Music.

His song “Overdose” was featured in the 2003 movie Party Monster for its parallel theme of drug use to the Club Kids of New York City.

But he not only gained attention as a producer of various chart hits, he also established himself as an internationally requested Top DJ with unrivaled success since 1993. 

This has been seen time and again with appearances in Germany at MAYDAY, LOVE PARADE, ENERGY, NATURE ONE and with an international following in the USA (NYC, Miami, San Francisco etc), Columbia, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and throughout Europe, from Istanbul to Estonia plus several appearances in the biggest UK clubs such as THE GALLERY, GODSKITCHEN, TANGLED or PROMISE.

The year 2004 will see TOMCRAFT as one of the busiest DJs around, playing tours in the US, ASIA and AUSTRALIA.

Together with his producer Robert Bormann aka ENIAC, TOMCRAFT has created hits such as "THE MISSION", "THE LORD" "THE CIRCLE" TV series .Others such as "SILENCE", "PROSAC", "OVERDOSE" and his latest U.K. number 1 hit "LONELINESS". In 2001 TOMCRAFT was also nominated for an ECHO AWARD in the category of best dance-act. In 2003 TOMCRAFT won 3 Germand Dance Awards for BEST ALBUM, BEST RADIO HIT and BEST DANCE TRACK.
