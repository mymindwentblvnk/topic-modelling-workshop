Joe Granata is an American heavy metal guitarist and composer born in Rhode Island, USA. Joe has been playing guitar since the age of twelve. During his grade school years he also picked up the trumpet, saxophone and drums finally settling on the electric guitar after listening to the guitar play of Randy Rhoads and Metallica's Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield. Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix, Darrell "Dimebag" Abbott, Steve Vai, Eddie Van Halen plus many others have all been a huge influence on his early playing style.

Joe's diverse taste in music caters to audiences who love everything from hard rock and metal to thrash and blues. Joe has a natural passion and interest in music of all genres and is determined to gain mastery of the instrument. Granata is currently studying ways to interpret and perfect the neo-classical style of guitar play made famous by the likes of Ritchie Blackmore, Michael Angelo Batio and Yngwie Malmsteen.

In August of 2006, Granata went into the recording studio to cut his self-financed debut album entitled 'A Long Road to Hell.' The album was recorded "live" and showcases his diversity and emotion along with his technical and improvisational ability. Joe has incorporated virtually all playing techniques available on the guitar in addition to speed, precision and intensity.

The album mixes his many original metal and thrash riffs with powerful vocals. Aaron Martin from (Hypersolid) is also featured on drums. This record captures Joeís sound at this particular point in time, as his playing style and ability is frequently evolving. Joeís goal is to have a long and fulfilling career as a musician and composer. 'A Long Road to Hell' was launched on April 1, 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Granata">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
