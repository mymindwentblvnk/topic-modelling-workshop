FIMBUL (NO). In essence the entity known as Fimbul formed in Norway
during the winter of 1994 by creator Ramn. Ramn, who was previously in
the band Eclipse, wanted to make a project that was more to his own
style, playing all instruments by himself. Fimbul released two demos in
1995, "Vinterland" and "Det Siste Slaget", which can be described as
Grim, Atmospheric Dark Metal Symphonies. Twelve years later "Vinterland",
and "Det Siste Slaget" have been combined on CD, called "Ramnens Ferd",
the first time this material was available on CD format. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fimbul">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
