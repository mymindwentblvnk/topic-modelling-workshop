Robert Manos is a New York based singer and musician who has collaborated on Techno, Drum and Bass and Deep House releases with Jesper Dahlb채ck, Seba, Terry Lee Brown Junior, Paradox, Hugg and Pepp, John Dahlb채ck, Charles Webster and Alexi Delano. Robert Manos spent his early years in Germany, Kenya and Tanzania before moving to New York as a teenager. His musical background is shaped by many influences including 70's Soul, R&B, New Wave, Dancehall Reggae and Classical Music. He began recording bits and pieces on a 4 track recorder using primarily drum machines,synths and electric bass and gradually began to add his voice to these recordings. Working as a bass player and background vocalist with various bands and projects, Robert began to develop his own style which can only be described as a mixture of everything he was exposed to, and as a way of trying to define the realities of living many lives in different worlds, the distance this can cause between people but also the sense of being connected to everything but at times lost to yourself. In 2002, Robert began collaborating on projects with Jesper Dahlb채ck and Sebastian Ahrenberg in Stockholm (Sweden), starting with the deep house track "My World". The first full album from Robert Manos called "Angel Road" was co-produced by Jesper Dahlb채ck and Sebastian Ahrenberg as well and was recorded at Globe Studios in Stockholm. Additional recording was done at Ingaro Studios in Budapest (Hungary) and a certain small apartment facing east high above 7th ave, New York (USA).  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Manos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
