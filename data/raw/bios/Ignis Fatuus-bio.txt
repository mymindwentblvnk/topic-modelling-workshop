In 1998 Ignis Fatuus released an impressive debut album, "The Futility Goddess" (on UK label Cold Spring). Their astonishing mixture of neoclassical darkwave and ambient (with amazing vocal contributions from Jarboe) gathered a load of positive feedbacks from everywhere. In 2005 Ignis Fatuus, joined by Melysa Baucom, signed with Eibon Records (Italy) and came back with "In Our Mad Bliss". Dark, warm, rich, gloomy music that transcends boundaries and defies definitions. Fairy-tinted musical scenarios, impressive female vocals, a sensual and seductive journey through a gently illuminated nocturnal world.
