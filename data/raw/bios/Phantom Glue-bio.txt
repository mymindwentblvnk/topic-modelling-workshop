An avalanche of distortion, psychedelicized occult coloured howlings and roars on early colonial america colliding with mythology and surrealistic nightmares. Phantom Glue have tapped a sunken Lovecraftian vein and extracted a uniquely rotten drek of something you inexplicably know but can't name. 
Phantom Glue hails from Boston Massachusetts. They documented a collection of 7 songs in Salem Massachusetts at God City Studio in 2008 which were initially released by the band and then re-released by TBD Records. Art work for both versions of the release created by the bands' own M.Oates. Phantom Glue recently completed a 2nd aural document of 7 songs titled A War Of Light Cones. It was again recorded w/ K.Ballou at God City, and again features confounding surrealist art work created by M.Oates, the release of which will occur ? 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Phantom+Glue">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
