Sleigh MSN was formed by Semnai's vocalist Denis Hautaniemi and drummer Jari Ketola in March 2008, because they wanted to play a bit heavier music. The two guys started to look for a bass and guitar player for the band and then hooked up with bass player Mikko Ker√§nen and guitarist Marcus Takala.

Now when the band was formed they begun to think of a name for the band and decided to call it Sleigh MSN. The band started off nice and quickly and in a short period of time they had many songs composed.

Sleigh MSN decided to go to the studio in May 2008 and recorded their first four track demo called Demo 2008. The demo was recorded, mastered and mixed in Biotech Audio Solutions studio by Sami "Hannu" Koivisto. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sleigh+MSN">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
