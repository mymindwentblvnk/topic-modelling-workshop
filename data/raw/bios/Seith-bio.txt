Over a decade ago the two founding members V. Lind and T. Turtinen met and started playing together, creating riffs, melodies and some song structures. The project remained nameless and somewhat active with a few part-time members until 2007. This all changed and things finally fell into place in when M. Sankala rejoined the group as an active member and M. Jaara was introduced to play drums. The line-up was complete. From then on the band was known as Seith. 

In 2008 the long wait paid off. The songs had taken their time to develop into their prime and we were ready enough, confident and able to get the best out of them. It has always been a more or less constant motion towards this moment, this first major step, which is the releasing of our self-published debut album "Alas". 

At the end of this year we had some lineup changes as V. Korpela replaced M. Jaara on drums, and we found P. Henell to play bass. Now we are writing material for the next album and try to play as many shows as possible.
