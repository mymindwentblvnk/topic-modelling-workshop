''The up-and-coming sensational four-piece modern metal band ToxicRose was formed in Stockholm Sweden in 2010.
Consisting of Tom (Gemini Five), Andy and Michael (both EX Lipstixx 'n' Bulletz) and Goran (EX Sexydeath).

There is no compromising or limits in the world of ToxicRose. Powerful Vocals combined with Aggressive Guitars , Grand melodic Synths & Dark Emotional Lyrics.
TXR stands tall for the outcast and they're here to take metal to a new level.
With their catchy melodic epic metal anthems and shocking look they are unstoppable!''
