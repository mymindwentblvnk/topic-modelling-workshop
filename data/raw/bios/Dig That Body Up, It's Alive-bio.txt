here some info about DIG THAT BODY UP... IT'S ALIVE! from NATE DENVER (vocals)

DTB... IA! existed for less than a year. Tthe band was formed in San Francisco by JOHN DWYER (guitar) and ORAN CANFIELD (drums). they played about three shows before i joined as the singer. we played ferocious death metal for a few months and then the band went to sleep, forever. our record was supposed to be released by tUMULt records, but it never came out. i need to ask andee about that, i'm not sure why didn't come out. oran played on a small jazz drum kit and john played guitar through a gigantic bass cabinet and a guitar amp. the shows were deafening and i wore ear plugs so i'd be able to sleep after shows and practice. john and oran's musicianship was incredible, creative and fun to listen to. we had a great time in this band, and even though practices were plagued by arguments, afterwards we'd almost always ride our bikes a few blocks together, in good spirits, before parting ways to retire to our loving homes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dig+That+Body+Up,+It%27s+Alive">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
