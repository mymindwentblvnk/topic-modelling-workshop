Bong Breaker ~ Holland
Stoner/Sludge/Doom Metal 

From a trailer deep in the forest hails the sound of Bong Breaker, a three piece stoner metal band from Holland. Droning guitar riffs with clean vocals as wel as deep growls form their massive sound. On stage they propel themselves and their audience to a higher state of mind with an arsenal of ancient amps. Their demo release was very well received. Once again they will crank their amps while producing their promising debut full-length album! 

Mink Koops - Drums
Bart Burger - Guitar
Wilmar Timmerman - Bass, Vocals
