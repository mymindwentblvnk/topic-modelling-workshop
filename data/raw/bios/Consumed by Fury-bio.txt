Consumed By Fury has been together since 2003. A chance meeting between then semi-retired bassist Rory Grams, and guitarist Adam Bricker, at a "Threat Revolution" GIG, {Bricker Band} brought the two together in the final version of "Industrial Strength", with Pat Bricker, and Martin on VOX. After the break up of "I.S.", the three remaining brothers, Grams Bricker, and Marin, looked long and hard for the right drummer to pull of their bombastic assault! After a false start with a player who shall remain nameless, {for his sake, not ours}, the boys finally found Jason Hatzell doing double duty at a "Cryptic"/"Mytherium" show. This second and by far the most lethal version of the band is hard angry and very aggressive. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Consumed+By+Fury">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
