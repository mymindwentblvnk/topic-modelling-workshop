Carved in Flesh is lyrically in the realms of depression, self-hatred and the ultimate final act of desperation against one's self. The band has not even slightly overlooked brutality. The music rages along with all the feeling and emotion of an abused child who grew up to become a serial murderer. And may leave the taste of gun metal in your mouth.
