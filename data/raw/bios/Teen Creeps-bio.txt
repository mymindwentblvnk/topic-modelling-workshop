TEEN CREEPS are an indie rock band from Belgium. The three piece bring the sounds of 1990s alt-rock to the present day with a fresh energy. The main ingredients? Fuzzy guitars, fast drumming and heartfelt vocals. On their new album ‘FOREVER’ the band still brings the noisy punk bangers, but also explores a more melodic and melancholic approach. “Mellower, without losing any of their edge”, as The Line of Best Fit writes.
