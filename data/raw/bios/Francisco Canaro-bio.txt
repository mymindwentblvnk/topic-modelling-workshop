Francisco Canaro (November 26, 1888 â€“ December 14, 1964) was an Uruguayan violinist and tango orchestra leader.

Known as "Pirincho" Canaro, he had a career that spanned many decades, and his orchestra was one of the most recorded. Much of his recorded music is in the classic salon style of the 1940s, but he is also considered a member of the old guard, and some of his later recordings contributed to the transition to concert tango. For many contemporary dancers and listeners, his early golden age recordings are the best.

Canaro composed the music for the 1915 Argentine classic, Nobleza gaucha. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Francisco+Canaro">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
