Or•phon•ic Or•ches•tra (ôr'fon'ik ôr'kes'tr?) n. Rock band from Milwaukee influenced by classical, Pop, Punk, and Heavy Metal

Orphonic Orchestra was formed in 2001 by two former members of Supergun Jones, Johnny Mars (guitar/vox) and Matt Kopf (drums). It was originally intended to be Johnny Mars' solo project, but over the years--with changes in band-members and structure--it has become an all-out band, happily performing and thriving in the rock and metal scene. 
The current line up includes Kassandra (vox), Johnny Mars (guitars/vox), Desiree (bass), and recent addition Chad Novell (keys/vox). The result is something between metal, rock, classical and a hint of pop. The band has two released recordings to date: a self-titled album as well as a self-titled 6-song demo. Both are available for purchase on iTunes and through their online web-store. Please visit www.orphonic.com for more information.
