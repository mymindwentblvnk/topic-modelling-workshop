Another pearl from the fjords of Norway, Phonophani is a highly experimental electronic composer, with a great sense of detail and syncopated rhythm, working with his home-brewed software to create never-heard before sounds. Nevertheless, his work remains accessible for those able to cope with its apparent weirdness, and provides one of the most moving music one can hear, generating mostly melancholia, sadness ("End of All Things"), floating impression, but sometimes also more vivid and positive feelings ("Turquoise Egg").

Phonophani (a.k.a. Espen Sommer Eide) is also part of the duo Alog, along with Dag-Are Haugan.
