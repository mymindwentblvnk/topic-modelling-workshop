Together, the German quartet create a spiraling whirlwind of unease and unrest across Azavatar. At once overwhelmingly hypnotic and restlessly manic, the five-track album explodes with harrowing fury, often to simmer while tension mounts and the listener is kept on the edge of a knife, only for yet further explosions of grimy, teeth-gnashing, and yet strangely melodic black metal and that knife sinks deeper.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Azavatar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
