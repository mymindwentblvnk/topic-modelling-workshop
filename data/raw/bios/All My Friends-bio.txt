There are two bands called All My Friends;

1. All My Friends was an indie pop/alternative band based in Glasgow, Scotland.
The group comprised of Garry Hoggan (Music, Production, Vocals) and Alison Eales (Lyrics, Vocals), and (for a handful of shows) Jason Sweeney (Drums/Percussion), Paul McDaniel (Bass), and Robert Wright (Rhythm Guitar). All the music was recorded by Garry at home. In 2007 they self-released their debut album 'All My Friends Get Hung Up', following this up with the 'Up and Down The River' EP. They played 2 shows at famous Cavern Club in Liverpool in 2008 as part of The International Pop Overthrow festival. Their legacy thus cemented in popular culture, they walked off into the sunset.

2. All My Friends is a Canadian synth-pop duo based in Vancouver BC, consisting of Brian Holt (Vocals, Synths) and Josh Custodio (Backing Vocals, Synths). All My Friends formed in the summer of 2009, shortly after Custodio purchased a Microkorg synthesizer, upon which Holt responded interest in making an electronic EP. After a wave of positive feedback from their first song, Tonight Happens, and even more success from their second, Where Do We Go From Here?, the pair went on to write another four tracks in order to release their debut EP, I Have No Faith in Machines <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/All+My+Friends">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
