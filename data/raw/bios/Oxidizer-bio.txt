Oxidizer is an experimental music project from Finland, founded by Aquarium Shark in 05.11.2006. Oxidizer's music varies from "sequencer metal" and fast-paced electro to calm, classical music-influenced ballads.

At the moment, Aquarium Shark publishes Oxidizer-tracks through Mikseri.net, and so, they're free for download. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oxidizer">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
