FROM CITIZEN TO SOLDIER formed in January 2005 from remnants of past bands. FCTS came together with the same ideal of creating violent, heavy music. For those of you who have been to a FCTS show, you know that there are no gimmicks - just straight up metal with savage ass breakdowns, and the most intense pits you can see in the midwest.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/From+Citizen+to+Soldier">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
