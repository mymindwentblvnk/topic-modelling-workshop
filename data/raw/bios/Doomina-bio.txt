Doomina is an Austrian sludge-postrock-outfit born out of a passion for “sound and noise” in Völkermarkt, Austria in 2006.

That same year, the first demo “A.O.D” was recorded and the second piece “March On, Dead Man” was released digitally in early 2009 after a hiatus due to health reasons.

The first full-length "Elsewhere" was released in June 2012.

Some media sources also says that, -  "..Doomina is a combination of Electric Wizard and Acid King with a harmonic influence of late Neurosis pieces that in some parts even reminds you of Mogwai and Tortoise..".


After some line-up changes their second full-length "Beauty" was released in September 2013.
