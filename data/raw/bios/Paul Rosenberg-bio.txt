Paul Rosenberg (also known as Paul Bunyan) is an American music manager known for his association with hip hop artists Eminem, Three 6 Mafia, The Knux and pop punk band Blink-182.  As well as managing said artists, Rosenberg is also the co-founder (with Eminem) of hip hop record label Shady Records, founded in 1999.  Rosenberg first became involved with Eminem in 1997, during the recording of The Slim Shady EP, and has since been featured in a skit (titled "Paul" except on The Eminem Show, where it was called "Paul Rosenberg") every album since The Slim Shady LP as a character concerned with the particular record, advising Eminem on steps to take and often ordering him to "tone down" the lyrics or scrap the album completely. With Eminem, Rosenberg co-wrote every skit on the 2009 album Relapse. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Rosenberg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
