1. About Craving
CRAVING: what do you think a person, that played nearly a third of his life in this damn band will tell you? Dont believe a word.... its a band. a four piece. guitar, bass, vocals and drums. founded in fall of 1992. once there was a second guitarist and the drummer changed. until now theres an amazing list of shows in so many different places, adventures to fill pages and quite a share of cool recordings, one might mention. Were the greatest rock band on earth..... still prooving! Anyway, we like it that way. any more questions? listen, all the rest is idle gossip, be it from the band or the scenepolice. CRAVING wont leave the pathway along that all those good rock-bands before had to carry their burden. Well hung and more rock than ever, emphasis still lays on traditional values, the crease cut like a knife: made to measure, so to speak. With discipline the flag of the axis-powers stuttgart-bonn-chicago is hoisted to wave out of sheer spite against all the scenepolice and deviants. A pumping bass over crossfiring drums build the fundament for cut-off guitar string distortions. This time youll even recognise the vocals if enjoy it the less volume way. A sign has emerged these days and if you are willing to like your share of at least two of these fine bands/labels (that is to speak, he, who cant be without the look into the right drawer) shouldnt keep his fingers off this album: bign, shellac, tar, jesus lizard, monorchid, hammerhead, guzzard, rye coalition, vaz, touch and go, dischord, gern blandsten, amrep, slowdime, reptilian, boxfactory etc...
