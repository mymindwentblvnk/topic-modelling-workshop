Autumn 2008.
Gabriel, Alice e Rob, fascinated by '80s metal sonorities, thrash metal above all, enter their rehearsal room with the intention of bringing back to life and on stage that dirty, brutal and aggressive sound of the '80s. From the start, they begin to write down fast, straightforward and violent songs, which are then recorded next year, as a demo (September 2009). With the recorded demo, with the first shows in mind, they complete the line up in a few months, when the bass player Wolly joined the band. Year 2010 is a busy one: the band hold various shows, both in their country and abroad, but they keep on writing new songs for their first EP. "Pathology", title of their first work, is recorded in February and March 2011; the work of recreating darkness and rage of the old sonorities is done with great care, and the mixing takes away a few months. The EP is finally released on 3rd November 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gravelead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
