Sally Seltmann is an award-winning songwriter and singer based in Melbourne, Australia. She has previously released albums and performed under the name 'New Buffalo', and is well known as the co-writer of the song '1234', performed by Feist. Sally now returns with Harmony to My Heartbeat, the first single from her new album, due for release in early 2010.

Previous recordings by Sally as New Buffalo include her debut EP 'About Last Night', which was released in Australia (through Modular) and the UK (through Heavenly).
