How many times have you heard the "…they were a great band, but after their release in 198x they mysteriously disappeared…" story??? If you're into eighties metal, especially thrash, I'd say you heard stories such as this one many times. Well, (unfortunately) the Have Mercy story is also one of them, at least in a way…
Have Mercy was a great thrash metal band, which started and disbanded already in the Eighties. Their music consisted of great thrash riffing, wild guitar soloing and high-pitched vocals (at least most of the time). Yes, you guessed right - this was, indeed, a killer combination. Hence, Have Mercy was often compared to bands such as Agent Steel, but as you probably already know, every band is special in it's own way, and this rule surely applies to Have Mercy more than to any other band.
Fortunately in their quite short time of exsistence Have Mercy managed to release a few demos and even an EP, but on the other hand, it was even a greater shame that they didn't get a chance to release at least one whole album – they disbanded instead...
