The Dim Aura cult was born in August of 2010 in Tel Aviv, Israel.
Dim Aura are and always will be:
H - Vocals
Ferum - Guitars
Ofir - Bass
E.F.F. - Drums
The hellish quartet immediately started writing original material to complete a first printed E.P.
Thus 'R.U.S.T.' was created and widely distributed around record labels all over Europe and the black metal followers in Israel and across the globe.
'R.U.S.T.' was recorded and mixed at Noize studio in Tel-Aviv by Ze'ev Radiano, and Mastered by Maor Appelbaum from Radiostar studios in Los Angeles.
Dim Aura is non conformist true black metal act and its live performances are an on-stage ritual.
We are currently looking for a record label and a chance to spread our virus across the planet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dim+Aura">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
