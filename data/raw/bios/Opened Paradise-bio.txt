The Greeks Opened Paradise were formed in the summer of 2003. Through music they wanted to express feelings and thoughts that were kept inside and had to breathe. Up till now they have shared the stage with names such as Fields of the Nephilim, Garden Of Delight, Nosferatu, Clan of Xymox, Paradise Lost, Type O Negative, Moonspell, Rotting Christ, Theatre Of Tragedy, Arcturus, Elusive and many more. On March 2005 they’ve participated on ‘Beyond the Veil III” Festival which was held in Leeds (UK). Their debut album “Occult” reached the stores on 2006 and has earned very good reviews by the Greek and foreign press.

During the years 2007-2008, the band earned a presentation in the pages of UK’s “Kaleidoscope” magazine, one of the most renowned magazines concerning the genre, and participated in various foreign gothic compilations, some of which are: “Embrace the Shadows: Vol. II”, “Smoke and Spotlight Vol.2” (Death-rock.de), “Gothic Compilation Part XLI” (“Gothic magazine” release). After a 4-year period of silence, the band signs with “Dark Side Records” and releases on 2012 “Tides” EP, while re-releasing “Occult” LP under the same label. With respect to their gothic rock roots and the steps that brought them up to here and now, they follow the path reunited and reformed.
