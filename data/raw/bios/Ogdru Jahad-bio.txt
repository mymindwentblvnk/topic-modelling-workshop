Black Metal of Death from Denmark.

The idea of Ogdru Jahad have been present for many years now. The original goal was to form a temporary band, record a few songs, spread them in the underground and play some live shows and then dissapear again. 

Nothing happened for a long time, but while Sadomator was touring around with a line-up, composed mainly of session members, the idea of Ogdru Jahad finally took form and became a reality. 

After the very first rehearsal a lead guitarist was added and the line-up was complete. 

A rehearsal tape was recorded and home dubbed in 50 copies, these copies were spread for free in the underground, but it soon became clear that there was a far greater demand and so a live tape was made in 300 copies and in the same way spread for free, traded for beer or traded for other tapes. 

Already in 2011 the band signed a deal with Iron Bonehead and Ancient Darkness for a debut LP/CD release and more steady rehearsals and live shows have now made Ogdru Jahad into a band with plans to stick around for years to come and there is no longer plans to disband in the near future.
