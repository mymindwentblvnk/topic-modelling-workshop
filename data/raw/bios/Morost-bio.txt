Morost was formed in 2010 by former members of a death/doom metal band Cold Dew with a desire of creating complex metal music. In November 2012, after a few years of fine tuning their creative process and some changes in the lineup, the band began recording their debut album in Negligence Studio. The album is named Solace in Solitude and was released in July, 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morost">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
