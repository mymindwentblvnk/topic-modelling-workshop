Golgolot plays a music style called "hebrew metal" , lyric-wise the band sings on hebrew culture, history ,and identity and hebrewism with strong contempt towards the enemies of israel and their pathetic beliefs. music-wise  the band focus on mixing metal ( second wave israeli black/death metal (salem for exemple) , thrash metal(bay area) , epic heavy metal) and hebrew folk music (daiwan,chassidic , pyiut,etc...) and experimental/prog ideas

Between 94-98 band has released some demos and rehearsal tapes  ,the more known are voodo ,and death to the christ  ,(others are 'in darkness to come' demo in 97 and 'hand of doom' in 98 single demo ,which sole track from (avadon) was later attached to the death to the christ re-issue, and 99 'golgolot' demo which was later attached as side b for the open the wargates tape release)  , later on came the more known and better sounding recordings:
