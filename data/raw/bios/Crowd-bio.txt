The beginnings of Crowd date back to 1998 in Kuldīga, lately the band were based in Rīga, Latvia.

A big leap forward came in 2000 when lead singer Jana joined the band. Her voice and attitude completely changed the band's sound and performance style. Crowd worked on improving their unique sound for a couple of years. The payback for this hard work came in 2004, when the band earned many awards at unsigned band contests and festivals in Latvia. The most important award was the Grand Prix at Sinepes un Medus 2004'. This victory gave a chance to record and distribute an album in cooperation with a recording company. The breakthrough year 2004 ended by a warm up performance for Paradise Lost in Rīga.

Crowd's debut album Jūtu Evolūcija was released in February, of 2005. That turned a page in band's history and set new goals.

In the end of 2009 they announced an indefinite hiatus.
