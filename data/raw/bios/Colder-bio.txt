Colder is a name of at least two artists:

[1] A French dance pseudonym of Marc Nguyen Tan.
[2] A Pori, Finland metal band.

[1] A dance project for Marc Nguyen Tan (1974) from France, a graphic designer who also is a DJ and remixer who remains actively involved in dance music and other projects.

Despite the fact that Colder is, for the most part, entirely electronic, it is notably recognized for its influence by and similarities to Joy Division. Many of the drum patterns, instruments, and styles of the songs can be directly linked to Joy Division tracks. The design work of the albums and singles also strike strong similarities to Joy Division album covers (particularly Closer, which even resembles the name Colder); revealing Marc Nguyen Tan was also inspired heavily by Peter Saville.

After studying film at university, he started to work as junior art director in 1995 for Grolier Interactive, then became art director at the Shaman design studio. He worked as art director for TV on-air design, then directed as freelance promos and title sequences for Eurosport cable channel. Co-founded "le cabinet. paris." with Benoit Emery in May 2000.

In 2015, after a long hiatus, Colder will be releasing a new single "Turn Your Back", to be followed by his third album.
