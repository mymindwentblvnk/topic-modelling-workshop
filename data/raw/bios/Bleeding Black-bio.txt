There are two bands with this name:

1)  Black Metal band from Vratza, Bulgaria (1999-2004, 2004-present Orenda). 
      They have released 2 albums:
      - Too Black, 2002 (Blackwhite Inc./0.4.3)
      - Personal Hell, 2003 (0.4.3)

The year is 1999 when two souls (Agan on guitars and Vampiriac on bass) decide to unite forces in sculpting their own gifts that to place in front of the Black Metal altar someday. Soon after this two more individuals, namely Pericles (drums) and Pagane (vocals) join, and the band is formed. The name chosen is Bleeding Black.

2)  Who would’ve thought that Kentucky, making a pit-stop in Orlando for a damn good cause would be the birthplace of a blazing new rock band? Bleeding Black has risen out of the ashes of a couple different bands to form and initiate their dominance over the current modern rock circuit with a roaring sound inspired by the grittier stylings of a “Guns N’ Motley” mash-up while mixing their musical cocktail with the heavier side of the Foos and STP. While the band are obvious 80s’ babies with influences ranging from those legendary above-mentioned bands to the modern heavy titans like Atreyu and A7X, Lexington’s Bleeding Black deliver a sonic assault of a hard-driving yet melodic sound that will definitely come across as unique for 2008 and beyond. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bleeding+Black">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
