Nite-Funk is an occasional collaborative outlet for Ramona Gonzalez, aka Nite Jewel, and Damon Riddick, aka DÃ¢m-Funk. The two were brought together in 2009 by XLR8R magazine, which featured them in a recurring "Tune in an Afternoon" series. Riddick was going to produce a track fronted by Gonzalez, but they reversed roles for "Am I Gonna Make It," a tripped-out slice of soulful synth pop. The duo continued to work separately and with other artists for several years, but they reconvened during the latter half of the 2010s. Gonzalez contributed to Riddick's 2015 album Invite the Light. The next year, "Can U Read Me?," a twilit slow-jam duet, appeared on Riddick's DJ-Kicks mix. Only a few weeks later -- just after Gonzalez' Liquid Cool album surfaced -- Riddick released a four-track Nite-Funk EP on his Glydezone label. ~ Andy Kellman <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Nite-Funk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
