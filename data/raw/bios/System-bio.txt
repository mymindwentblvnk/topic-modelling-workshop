System is a name of at least four acts:

1) A Danish producer trio (aka Future 3).
2)  A Swedish retro-synthpop duo.
3) A UK drum and bass producer (aka MC System).
4) A German punk band from the early 80s.
5) A Bulgarian black metal band.

1) A Copenhagen, Denmark producer trio, of Thomas Knak (aka Opiate, producer of two tracks on Bj√∂rk's "Vespertine"), Anders Remmer (aka Dub Tractor) and Jesper Skaaning (aka Acustic). Since 1995, they have been releasing, increasingly pop-oriented, albums as Future 3. They have a common love for dub and their music is usually heavy with: reverb, echo and bass.

2) A Stockholm, Sweden retro-synthpop duo, of Herr A and Herr B, formed in the early 90s.

3) A London, UK drum'n'bass producer (aka MC System and Mark System). He started his MC career on London's pirate radio station Rude FM. He was at one time a part of the Future Thinking crew who throw drum'n'bass parties in the London area. His production style is reminiscent of the old Reinforced Records and Metalheadz sounds.
