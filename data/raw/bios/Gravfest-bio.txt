Gravfest is an extreme metal band hailing from Bergen, Norway. They were formed around October 2008, after the drummer William and the guitarist Jostein had started jamming. The band started out with William on drums, Jostein on guitar, Pattrick on bass and Kristopher doing the vocals. The line-up lasted for a while, but in 2010 Kristopher and Pattrick left the band. So Jostein took over the vocals, and Karim joined as Gravfest's new bassist. In 2011 Stefan joined as the 2nd guitarist, and the line-up was completed. Gravfest plays a brutal mix of old school thrash, death and black metal, inspired by bands like Slayer, Napalm Death, Aura Noir and Darkthrone.

Jostein Thomassen - Vocals and guitar
