VLE is a project started by one being in July 2001. Inspired by ocean sunsets, darkness and silence, VLE has created improvised expressive minimalist soundscapes that serve to evoke different emotions. VLE is a journey through timeless motifs and cosmic spheres of existence. The sound of VLE is raw and emotional as all pieces were constructed without use of programming or traditional composition style. The music of VLE is very eclectic as each piece represents the different moods we all experience in this life. This is music from the soul, music erected from the subconscious.
