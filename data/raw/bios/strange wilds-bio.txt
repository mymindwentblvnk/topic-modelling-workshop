Strange Wilds formed in Olympia, WA in 2012. The band grew out of the fertile Pacific-Northwest punk scene, with members from Negative Press, Outlook, Wreck, and a bunch of other punk/hardcore bands of the last few years. Shortly after the 2014 release of their debut, the four-song Wet 7‚Äù on Inimical Records, the band settled into the classic, economical, power-trio configuration of bass, drums, and a single guitar, and signed to Sub Pop. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Strange+Wilds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
