In the cold winter of 2012 in the city of Caxias do Sul/RS Brazil, "Swords at Hymns" has initiated its works. A project which has the simple proposal of making music as art and always placing it first without limiting it to styles neither labels nor ideologies, having lyrical themes focused on honor, battles, winter, nature and misanthropy, inspired by the environment that surrounds us always addressed in a philosophical and subjective way. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Swords+At+Hymns">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
