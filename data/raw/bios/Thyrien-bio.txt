Thyrien is a folk metal band from Kerava, Finland.

Once upon a time, in 2005 to be precise, Thyrien was forged in the cold and harsh wastelands of Finland. At the beginning it was only a way to express music for Oskari and Jere but later on a few other members appeared to strengthen the ranks of Thyrien. After a while they noticed that the new members weren't that into working as a band so few line-up changes were to be made. After a the line-up changes it was time to record the debut EP ‘’The Frozen North’’. The EP got a warm welcoming and after throwing a serious amount of gigs it was time to start forging the debut album in 2008. The album was named ‘’Hymns of the Mortals – Songs from the North’’. At the year 2013 the band finally signed their first record deal with MASSACRE RECORDS.

Folk metal, death metal and black metal - all those musical styles have been brought to you by the Finnish band called Thyrien offering you a fresh sip of mead without forgiving the traditions of the Folk metal. The band focuses on bringing you a melodic and brutal atmosphere with catchy drumming and grim vocals.
