"Scathe" is, as we speak, only a band in the making. Since there is no actual "band" yet, we don't realy have a name. Thus I used the name of the account I'm using on last.fm. 
The songs put up here are the near complete songs that have been written by me and/or some friends. As you may notice, the drum lines are the same and the quality of the songs is less than it should be. This is mainly because I recorded everything from my room with a recording utility and the drum lines come from my effects pedal. 
We originate from Ghent, Belgium and are hoping to get some feedback from a more international audience.
