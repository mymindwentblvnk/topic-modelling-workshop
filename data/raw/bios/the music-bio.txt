The Music was a British alternative rock band, originally formed in Kippax, Leeds, England in 1999 by Stuart Coleman, Phil Jordan, Robert Harvey, and Adam Nutter.

In 2001 the song Take the Long Road and Walk It circulated as a demo, before being released by Fierce Panda. The band were quickly signed by EMI/Virgin imprint, Hut, who released their first EP You Might as Well Try to Fuck Me.

In 2002, following another EP, The People, they released their eponymous debut album.

In Autumn 2004, they released their second album, Welcome to the North, and the accompanying single Freedom Fighters, before touring with Incubus. One of the singles from the album, Breakin', became a hit on American rock radio.

Their eagerly awaited third album entitled Strength in Numbers was released in June 2008. However, in September 2010, singer/songwriter Robert Harvey confirmed the group's intention to split, and on 31 March 2011 the band announced a series of farewell shows in Japan and the UK.
