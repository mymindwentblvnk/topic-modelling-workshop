No information is known about Sacellum Luciferi other than their nation of origin, Finland. Three tracks were recorded and used as one half of the split with French Black Metal act Mortifera.

The split Catacomb Mysteries was never intended to be made widely available. Only 20 copies of the cassette were made and quickly distributed between close friends. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sacellum+Luciferi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
