DANGERDOOM was a musical collaboration between producer DJ Danger Mouse and rapper MF DOOM. Their first album, The Mouse and the Mask, was released in 2005, and followed by the Occult Hymn EP, available for free download from the Adult Swim website.

The Mouse and the Mask was released on October 11, 2005 by Epitaph in the United States. It was also released by Lex Records in the United Kingdom on October 17, 2005, with different cover art.
