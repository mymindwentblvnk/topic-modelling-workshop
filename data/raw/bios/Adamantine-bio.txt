ADAMANTINE is a Metal band from Lisbon, Portugal formed in 2007 by frontman André Bettencourt , as one of the first Portuguese acts in the New Wave of Thrash Metal - and they do it all, from fast riffs with a heavy sound to super melodic choruses always innovating. Their fresh approach combining Modern Thrash with Rock have set them apart from other bands within the genre and established themselves with a unique approach to thrash metal in their local scene, especially after the release of the well received EP “Downfall Of Adamastor” in 2010, which allowed the band to gather a stronger fan base.

After an extensive tour in 2010 allowing them to open for bands like - Destruction (Ger), Gama Bomb (IRL), Lazarus AD (USA), Bonded By Blood (USA) and playing a couple of portuguese summer festivals, the band finally entered the studio on September 2011 to give it all on a full length.

With the release of their Debut Album “Chaos Genesis” in 2012, efforts got even serious and bigger. This ambitious album recorded at Poison Apple Studios (Hills Have Eyes, More Than a Thousand) and mastered by Tue Madsen (Moonspell, The Haunted, Dark Tranquility) slowly grown into a statement of their brand of Melodic Thrash Metal.
A well-crafted album rooted in Thrash and Metal but with the perfect among of rock sensibilities. A collection of songs which are truly honest, straight forward, with a unique trademark and unexpected surprises in every song blending thrash fast riffs, with melodic guitars and meaningful choruses. A trademark best called “Melodic Thrash”.
