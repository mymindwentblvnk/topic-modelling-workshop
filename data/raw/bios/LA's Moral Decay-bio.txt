The band was formed By Eddie & Jose on Jan 2000. They started in Venice Beach, West LA. Their first D.I.Y EP was called YOUTH ON THE STREET released in 2001 or 2002. The line up was Jose Decay, Eddie, Ian, and Danny. This line up didn't last that long... 
They relocated to South Central Los Angeles and thats where La's Moral Decay was born.
This is the line up i remember during that time:Jose Decay, Eddie, Nico, Spanky... They released on there own DIE FOR NOTHING on 2004, their first and last full length ever released. It has never seen the light of day. Some copies of it were sold but its a rare release- if you did find it... That release was  something special.
They broke up. I don't know the exact date but Jose Decay moved to San Francisco and PELIGRO SOCIAL was born. That's another story. Yes, its an Unfinished Story. Eddie from Moral Decay Formed  Ya Basta!
