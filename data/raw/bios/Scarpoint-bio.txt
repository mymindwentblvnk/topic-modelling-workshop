Storming straight out of Sweden, Scarpoint delivers a fast and heavy sound riddled with fast drums and brutal vocals. Formed in early 2000 by frontman Henrik Englund and guitarist Zoran Kukulj, the band spent years stomping out sellout shows while their 2003 promo flew off shelves.

Produced by Daniel Bergstrand (Meshuggah, In Flames), their debut LP, "The Silence We Deserve", is about to slam the metal scene with 10 enigmatic tracks like "Terminal Treachery" and "Behind the Shadows". After honing their craft for seven years, the experience is proven in their fresh new material - Scarpoint is ready to make a massive impact.
They later released The Mask of sanity, merging a "djent" sound crunch to death metal, but with grooves more akin to industrial metal. Following this was a new version of Burning in Hell, entitled Open Your Eyes. It included vocalists from bands such as Evergrey, nearly covering the whole spectrum of metal vocals.

Scarpoint are now working on a third album, and have said they will be adding a new member soon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scarpoint">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
