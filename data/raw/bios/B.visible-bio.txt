Getting a pair of turntables back in 2004 made B.Visible immediately addicted to the art of DJing. After spending day after day behind the decks, producing music was the logical further step. Highly influenced by the Golden Era sound, he started building his first beats. Trough his wide ranged taste of music and the special love to all kinds of electronic music he soon started to combine his boombap flavored beats with elements found in other genres. From that point on it was just a question of time when he will also break the classic boombap drum positioning and bpm rate. Working without boundaries to any kind of style but still keeping the raw and unpolished flavor of the 90s would be the best way to describe his musical output nowadays. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/B.visible">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
