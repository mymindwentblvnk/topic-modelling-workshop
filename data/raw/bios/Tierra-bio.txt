Tierra is a Latin R&B band that was established in the late 1970s by former El Chicano members Steve Salas (trombone and percussion), Rudy Salas (guitar), David Torres (keyboards) and Andre Baeza (percussion). The other original members were Bobby Navarrete (reeds), Joey Guerra (keyboards), Steve Falomir (bass guitar), and Philip Madayag (drums).

Their biggest hit was 1980's "Together". More recently, they appeared on Kid Frost's 2001 CD Still up in This ...., performing a new version of The Notations' "I'm Still Here".
