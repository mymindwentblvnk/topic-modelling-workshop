1: The norwegian alternative rock band Delaware

Delaware is an alternative pop / rock band from Drammen, Norway. They have a distinctive sound, characterised by vocalist Richard Holmsen's both angelic and raw, desperate voice. The combination of quite diverse elements in their music, makes it both beautiful to the ear and interesting for the mind.
At a concert by Delaware, you can find yourself listening to delicate, almost acoustic ballads that turn into monsters of screaming guitars and pounding drums. They do it with heart and mind, and every contrast feels natural.
Words that are used to describe songs by //delaware may vary from happy, uplifting, energetic and intense, to melancholic, dark and thoughtful. In other words, - Happy and sad - , at the same time. One word that describes all of Delaware's songs: melodic .
