The Whigs' 3rd album, In The Dark, was released on March 16th 2010.

The Whigs are a trio based out of Athens, GA. In 2005, The Whigs released the independently recorded Give 'Em All A Big Fat Lip. The band signed to indie label ATO Records, home to Radiohead, My Morning Jacket and Ben Kweller, in 2006. 

The band's second album, Mission Control, was released on January 22, 2008. It was produced by Rob Schnapf (Beck, Elliott Smith, Guided By Voices) at Sunset Sound and Sound Factory in Los Angeles, CA.

In early 2009 The Whigs embarked on a winter tour with Kings Of Leon, and the run closed out with a show at Madison Square Garden. This followed fall 2008 tours with Kings Of Leon, The Kooks, and Tokyo Police Club, capped off with a new years celebration with Band Of Horses.

In August 2009 the band went out with Kings Of Leon again, this time covering Western Canada and the west coast in the United States. That run ended at the old stomping grounds of the Los Angeles Lakers, The Forum. Late 2009 saw The Whigs on a North American headlining tour with support from Nashville's, The Features.

On March 16th, 2010, their third album, In The Dark, was released on ATO Records. The band hit the road with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club in late February 2010, leading up to the release of In The Dark. The band will appear at SXSW 2010 in Austin, TX. On March 31st, 2010, The Whigs will be featured as the musical guest on The Late Show with David Letterman where they will play the first single from IN THE DARK, "Kill Me Carolyne."
