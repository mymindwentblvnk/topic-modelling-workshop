Launched in 2012, SOLIUM FATALIS (Latin for "Fated Throne" ) Initiated from the mind of one Jim Gregory(guitar). Jim contacted Dirk Verbeuren(drums, Soilwork, Scarve, Bent Sea etc) who took on the drumming duties for the band. That set the wheels in motion to recruit Ehren Hill (Excrecor) for engineering at his infamous IRON HILL Studio in New Hampshire. Dirk brought bassist, Loic Colin from Scarve. Excrecor guitarist/frontman Jeff DeMarco rounded out the group on Vocals. With all the pieces in place, it became necessary to recruit THE best metal engineer in the biz Fredrik Nordstrom at Studio Fredman who handled the Mixing and Mastering of their Debut Album. Artwork was done by Septicflesh Vocalist/Bassist and exceptional artist Seth Siro Anton. This crushing release is sure to impress. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Solium+Fatalis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
