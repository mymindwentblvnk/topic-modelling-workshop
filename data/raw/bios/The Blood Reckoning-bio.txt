Spawned from the depths of Kokomo Indiana, The Blood Reckoning bring forth an epic force of death metal, fueled only by their love for the one true creator of the universe. The mass of the patrons that have attended their live performances no longer exist, as a result of the raw ferocity and power of Blakeâ€™s golden locks, but the rare survivors incessantly protest that it is a life-altering experience. Combining face melting solos and bone crushing breakdowns, The Blood Reckoning will triumph for many years to come, and are indeed a force to be reckoned with.
