"Son, you must be/Your own tree/Let your roots grow/Let them grow deep." Wise words, though when sung by a 19-year-old Blake Miller they're not so much delivered as sage counsel to the listener as they are repeated the way a kid would sing the grocery list on his way to the corner store lest he forget. Blake's youth isn't the only thing that makes him sound so special. His very human and melodic brand of folk helps distinguish him from the so-called "freak folk" genre (see Devendra Banhart) and creates a space he can call his own. I guess you could say he's being his own tree... -www.3hive.com <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blake+Miller">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
