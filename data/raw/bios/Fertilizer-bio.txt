1) Fertilizer was german death metal band formed in 1990. Released two demos and a full-length ''A Painting of Annoyance'' in 1994. They also appeared on the "Requiem - Morbid symphonies of death" compillation, along with Fulmination, Obscure Infinity and Obfuscation.

2) Fertilizer is a band from the Czech Republic (experimental, electronica, electropunk).

Fertilizer was accidentally formed throughout a weekend in September of 2008, and the first show held place the upcoming Monday.
Fertilizer has taken onto it to honour it's name. That is why it doesn't accept ongoing rehearsals or composing, whereas it disregards music theories as a whole.
In regard to the baffling situation in which it was created, this seemingly odd gathering has been quite successful in fertilizing the minds of the unreasonably courious. 

Iggy Sanchez - guitar
Genoslaw - machines
Tomski - visuals
