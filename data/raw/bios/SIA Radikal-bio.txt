Sia Radikal is a Latvian thrash metal band formed in Rīga, Latvia in 2008.

At that time five morally and physically serious subjects saw their mission ultimatum in joining forces by creating a musical project with one sole purpose - to "weld" the heaviest and utmost of metal music. The first portion of the public were presented a five piece band under the name Terch'em Up - a heavy metal tribute to Metallica's historical concert in Rīga. Soon after it was all very clear, the band has to be continued on full and that has to be in honor of the full power of thrash'n'roll, as heavy as possible and with a hard working attitude however strictly following the discontinuation of anglicism for the time being. Sia Radikal "weld" Latvian and say there is no shortage.

In late 2013, the band announced its split up.

In 2015, Sia Radikal will participate in the festival Klang.
