VULCANO was one of the first old school Black Metal bands, and the pioneer of extreme metal across South America, since 1981. Their first official material was released in 1983, when the band did not practice an extreme metal sound yet.

VULCANO always playing metal very different from the other Brazilian bands of the period, what made them a quite unique heavy music act. This fact, although in delayed form, was recognized at the right time.

During the period when the band stayed inactive, a total of 14 years during all its history, they were never forgotten by their true and loyal audience, over this long period of inactivity, without any public apparition, a common band could, easily, have been forgotten, but VULCANO, along with other Brazilian extreme metal bands, have ultimately influenced, directly,

The arise during the late 80's and early 90's of a new intense metal scene/style: The Norwegian Black Metal, with all it's fury and violence, was the responsible for give a new breath to the extreme metal music market. Great names of this scene - such as Fenriz and Infernus - doesn't save words to say that VULCANO was one of the most influential bands for the advent of what became known as second wave of Black Metal.

In 2011, VULCANO released their most recent studio album, Drowning in Blood, on which we are focused to develop our work.
