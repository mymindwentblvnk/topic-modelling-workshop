Bjarki (Bjarki Rúnar Sigurðarson, born September 9, 1990) is a techno producer of Icelandic origin. He is signed to Nina Kraviz's record label Tрᴎπ (TRIP Records) and frequently appears on compilations with other label mates. His experimental production style is derived from abrasive minimal techno, IDM, and trance music, influenced by artists such as Autechre.

Bjarki grew up in northern Iceland and began making music when he moved in with his dad at age 12. He learned how to operate a software sequencer with help from a friend's older brother, who demonstrated how to make basic beats — hard trance, reminiscent of The Chemical Brothers and The Prodigy — on a home computer. He continued experimenting with music and met fellow producer Exos upon moving back to Reykjavik, aged 15. Up until recently he was producing under the Kid Mistik alias.

After relocating to Copenhagen, a chance encounter resulted in his signing to Tрᴎπ when label head Nina Kraviz was playing at the city’s Culture Box club. His debut 12" Arthur and Intergalactic Whales featured the single "I Wanna Go Bang", which was positively received, in 2015. A trilogy of albums was released in 2016 drawing from his extensive archive of unreleased material, starting with Б in June, followed by Lefhanded Fuqs and Æ shortly afterwards. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bjarki">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
