Scared Of Chaka were a punk rock band based in Albuquerque, New Mexico who formed in 1993 by guitarist/vocalist David Yanul Hernandez, bassist Dameon Waggoner, and drummer Jeff Jones who was later replaced by Ron Skrasek. The band played a Dickies inspired mix of garage and pop-punk, following in the footsteps of local Albuquerque act The Drags. 

Scared Of Chaka released a number of full lengths, 7" EPs, and split records throughout their career for labels like 702 Records, Empty Records, Dirtnap Records and Hopeless Records spin off Sub City Records. With the release of 2001's Crossing with Switchblades the band called it quits. David Hernandez now plays bass for The Shins. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scared+Of+Chaka">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
