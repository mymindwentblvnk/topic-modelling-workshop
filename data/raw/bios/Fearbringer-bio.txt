Fearbringer's underground battle is characterized by a lot of rehealsals, audio & video material, gigs but the most important aspect is the deep and coherent work on the concept of the whole production,through esclusive solo projects. Each project is connected to the others through a serious research of the sources. Fearbringer denies the cristian god, and only respects Nature and the power of her laws. Only in this way he speaks about a "God". Tunguska project (Extreme Alien Horror Metal) is a "faith" and a deep work on ancient writings and ancient misteries of the past through paleoastronautic archeology. Fearbringer's Homonymous project (Against Church Battle Black metal) works on the corruption of the clergy in the past & present. Nature/goddess doesn't match with a rotten presumed deputy and this idea is carryed by a faith in great valours like justice, strenght, pride and courage. The third project, Armata di Carona (raw black metal), has an historical concept about Parma's dukedom and it can be strictly linked with the previous one. The fourth project, Presagio is based on the history of some Parma and Piacenza's families which had power during Middle ages and Renaissance through medieval music and pagan metal. So in Fearbringer's discography many differences can be found on a musical level, cause different is the deep mood, while each lyric is a part of complex structure. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fearbringer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
