BALLET SCHOOL are a Berlin-based three-piece group consisting of vocalist Rosie Blair, guitarist Michel Collet and Louis McGuire on drums. The band have been playing together since December 2012.

A ballerina supporting all her body weight on the tip of her toes appears to be weightless in the eye of the public. In deep meditation, she overcomes pain to deliver a true moment of Grace. Ballet School is about learning Grace.

The amalgam of diverse influences of the three members briefly summed up is 80's pop, shoegaze and RnB and the result is a vibrant and colourful new sound, created to be experienced live. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ballet+School">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
