Yoni Wolf, of  WHY?, and Chicago's  Serengeti have teamed up to bring you one incredible release, Testarossa. This is a truly incredible collaboration between two kindred spirits. With Testarossa, Yoni & Geti have created some of the best work of their careers. As always with these guys, there’s the undercurrent of sadness and regrets, sin and repentance, the juxtaposition of bleak reality, the surreal, and dark humor. It’s a dirty, weird and brilliant album that becomes more stark and visceral with every listen. This is love and willful destruction sharing a beer and a shot—the soundtrack to wrong decisions and crooked twists of fate. Yoni & Geti.
