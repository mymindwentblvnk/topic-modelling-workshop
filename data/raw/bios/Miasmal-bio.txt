Miasmal was formed in 2007, in Gothenburg, Sweden. In spring 2008, a 4 track demo was recorded by the band. This demo was released by Detest Records in 2008, and was also released as a limited 12" vinyl in 2009 as a co-release between Detest Records and Nuclear War Now. A few months later an additional 100 copies were pressed as an picture disc edition. All formats are now sold out.

In 2010 a 2-song 7" EP was released on Detest and Me Saco Un Ojo. It's currently sold out but should be repressed summer 2011.

Miasmal made their live debut in September 2010 at the Kill-Town Festival in Copenhagen, Denmark.

April 2011 will see the release of Miasmal's first full-length album. This 8-song assault will be released on vinyl by Detest / Me Saco Un Ojo, and on CD by Dark Descent Records. The CD will contain the demo and 7" as bonus tracks.

May/June will see Miasmal tour the US and making appearances on Maryland Death Fest and Chaos in Tejas.
