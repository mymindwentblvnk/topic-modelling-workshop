According to the  Taylor Dayne Songfacts Interview, Taylor grew up in Long Island, and her parents were very involved in independent theatre: the Manhattan Theatre Group, the Pap Theatre, La Mome. By 4 or 5 she was singing along with the radio.  Her dad gave Taylor her first radio, she turned it on and there was Stevie Wonder playing. As Taylor grew older, she started going into a little bit more of a rock direction as the top 40 was going in a different path for a period of time - it was more of the supergroups, Jethro Tull, Yes etc. She had her first solo by first grade, and by her fourth grade she was singing Jacques Brel.
