The OND project, which began in 1998, is a mix of organic and synthesized sounds using traditional instruments - guitars, cellos, trumpets, etc. - field recordings and samples.

Emerging from the dark to the light OND has an optimisism in the music which is somewhat lacking in others music - somewhat akin to a love song.
