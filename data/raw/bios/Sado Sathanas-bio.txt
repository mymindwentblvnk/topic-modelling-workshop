SADO SATHANAS was founded in late 1996 as a black/death-metal project. After some line up changes the band decided to turn their style to (epic) old school black metal. Since the band's formation are produced following records:

1997 Diabolische Inquisition (Demo)
1998 Vernichtungsschlag! (Demo)
2005 Bellum Omnia Versus Omnes - Reich Anti I.N.R.I. (Demo)
2010 Opus Diaboli (Full lenght)

The music unites epic-melodic moments with violent arrangements. Thematically the band is influenced by texts and works of Aleister Crowley, Friedrich Nietzsche and Niccolo Machiavelli. Music and lyrics has strictly to be understood as a product of black arts.
SADO SATHANAS denies every political interpretation.
