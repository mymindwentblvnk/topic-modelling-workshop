Northern Genocide was formed in 2010 in Helsinki, Finland. It all started with a meeting of old highschool friends, guitar player Pyry and programmer Raikka, after Pyry had discovered Raikka's interest in programming and computer music. They both had a history of playing in various metal bands, but now they wanted to try something new by bringing electronic influences to metal. The very same year they started recording demos in their home studio in Helsinki.

In 2012 both began studies in Lahti-Orimattila region and wanted to put together a crew for gigs and new demos. In december 2013 the band began the recording of new 3-track demo. After some changes to the initial line-up of the band, the demo "Atlantis" was finished in October 2014.

In 2014 the band started recording its first EP "Planet Asylum" in Orimattila, Finland. The EP was released on November 20th 2015. The EP includes 5 tracks: "Supernova", "Soul Overload", "Cataclysm Mankind", "Luxuria Nocturne" and "Tartaros".

In 2019 the band released their first LP "Genesis, Vol. 666". Same time they released their second music video which was for the title track "Genesis Vol.666". Video is inspired by the world of hoarding likes and attention in social media. Directed by Toni Kauko/ Kaukomedia

Currently the band is working towards releasing its second album in 2021. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Northern+Genocide">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
