Raised in a family of musicians, Timo found the way of an artist a natural path to follow. He started by playing violin in his childhood, and continued on to practicing guitar and composing music when he was twenty years old.
So far Timo has published three albums, each under a different project name: Viral's "Antediluvian Hunger" was released in 2008 and Omniavatar's "United Earth" in 2010. In August 2013 he published "Biographical" under his own name.
