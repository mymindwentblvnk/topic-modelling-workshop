Biography
Les Chants de Nihil is initially a basic project, made by Jerry & Mist from Legion Mortifere. The first tracks are improvisations in an old-school and basic black metal way. In february 2008 was created the first album, named "Les Six Le√ßons" (the six lessons) which is marking the new conception of black metal, with an idea of reformation. Since this album, Les Chants de Nihil drive through a philosophical and rationalist goal: to couple violence with hope.
