With a name probably taken from physics and science (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), Frank Etling and Stephan Lieb started a project called as its acronym, MRI. Band's sound is closely related to one of the Force Inc. sublabels, Force Tracks (now defunkt), that placed a standard in the microhouse style, releasing works from artists like MRI, Luomo, Dub Taylor, Safety Scissors, Mathias Schaffhäuser and many more giants of microhouse.
MRI was one of the most important artists in Force Tracks, with two full-lenght albums, Rhytmogenesis (FT023) and All that glitters (FT044), and a couple of singles, but suddenly, the project died (Feb 2002), and the last released we could enjoy is one called Blue (FT047), that features a 17:32 b-side called You're in, you're out.
