Scarlet's Well are a British band. They were founded by Bid, the Indian-originated singer and songwriter of The Monochrome Set, after the latter band amicably split, and released their first album in 1999. Throughout their career their releases have appeared on the Spanish label Siesta Records.

Originally intended purely as a studio project, and as an "atmosphere" more than a band, Scarlet's Well have been performing live since 2004. Their albums feature various, mostly female, vocalists along with Bid himself, who also writes most of the songs.
