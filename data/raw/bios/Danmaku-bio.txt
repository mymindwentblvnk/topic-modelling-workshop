Consisting of members of Anaal Nathrakh, Fukpig, The Ocean and Hospital of Death, Danmaku is the result of one long time thashers dream of getting together a band of other thrashers to create a fast, brutal thrash band that harks back to the glory days of thrash and early death metal. 

The Danmaku full length album is now finished and is out now at www.thrashlizard.bigcartel.com.

Danmaku are just putting the finishing touches to a live line-up and then you can expect live shows around the UK. 

Until then, check out the samples here and get yourselves worked up into a thrash tornado. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Danmaku">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
