Thorondir are a pagan metal band from Waldsassen, Bavaria. They were formed on June 15 2007 by Kevin Wienerl (vocals), Dominik Hautmann (rhythm guitar), Alexander Göhl (drums), Michael Ney (lead guitar), Fabian Wienerl (Keys / synthesizer) and Christopher Zeus (bass). However, shortly after the realease of their first album, Düsterwald (2008), Christopher Zeus left and was replaced by Florian Striegl.
Soon after the band landed a record deal with the Austrian label CCP records and re-released the Düsterwald album in 2009.

In a similar way to their contemporaries such as XIV Dark Centuries and Menhir Thorondir's music is based ancient Germanic and pagan history and mythology. Their lyrics deal with the gods and battles of ancient days as well as praising the beauty of nature.
