deuteronomy (also known as DOWNLOAD or â‡©LOAD) is an alias under the Halley Labs label. They are a hellbat that produces compilations of noise music.
They were originally separate from Halley Labs and their releases were on a separate Bandcamp page, which is no longer available.
As Emma's fursona, deuteronomy's alternate name, DOWNLOAD, was taken from the duology of PC Engine and CD games and a shmup of the name. deuteronomy's design from 2013 was made as a way to personify and sexualize Emma's own fears to lessen their effect on her. As such, the decision to make them a bat was based on stereotypical personality traits. As time passed, deuteronomy's design was toned down significantly and more effeminate, making them Emma's "casual" fursona.
On December 10, 2019, Emma announced on Twitter that the character of DOWNLOAD would have a 'real name' (deuteronomy) attached to them to reflect less harsh noise tracks, but the character was later entirely rebranded to this new name. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deuteronomy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
