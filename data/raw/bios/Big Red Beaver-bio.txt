Big Red Beaver is a little ole 4 piece coming out of the East Bay playing a blend of heavy rock and metal with a twist that is pleasing to the ear. It all began in late 2008 the idea of a name was born then starting with some members playing a house party in Feb of 2009 then the drummer moved and longtime childhood drummer John (Slackenloader, Cage) came into the picture in aug 2009. Then in Feb 2010 along came a vocalist named Jackson (Redfist, Mindgrind) then in July 2011 here came bassist Alex (Empathy) and now we started recording a full length and we are ready to hit some pavement!
