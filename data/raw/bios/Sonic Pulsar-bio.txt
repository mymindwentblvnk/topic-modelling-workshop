Sonic Pulsar is a Portugese space metal project headed up by the creative genius of Hugo Flores. The other two regular musicians are Carlos Mateus (some guitars and synths, backing vocals) and Nuno Ferreira (bass). Flores provides lead vocals, produces the albums, and plays pretty much everything else.

The project's first album, Playing The Universe (2003), is a pure space metal endeavor, similar to Ayreon circa-Into The Electric Castle. The second album, Out Of Place, takes on a slightly more Dream Theater-esque sound, both in concept and execution, while still appealing to fans of the band's first effort. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sonic+Pulsar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
