If music pedigree means anything, THE ‘89 CUBS are a band gifted from their humble birth.

Comprised of Dan Brennan, Matt Baum and Ryan Fox, THE ‘89 CUBS hail with much pride from Omaha, NE. The trio features members of such respected indie acts as THE GOOD LIFE, BRIGHT EYES and DESAPARECIDOS. With a jittery and upbeat indie-rock style that leans heavy on the introspective lyrics, jangling guitars and a loose-knit interplay that could only come from both lifelong musicians and longtime friends. In fact, the band even got their fathers (Terry Brennan and Greg Fox) involved, having the two of them lend guitar work to "There Are Giants in the Earth" final song.

"There Are Giants in the Earth" was recorded by the band over a period of a couple months in various locations (from studios and houses in Nebraska to a library in North Carolina, etc) and the final material was mixed AJ Mogis and mastered by Doug Van Sloun.

With a level of enthuasism that draws comparison to the early days of SUPERCHUNK, guitar heroics that recall MY BLOODY VALENTINE and a level of songwriting sincerity that brings to mind any number of their Omaha peers, THE ‘89 CUBS have created a stunning debut album of confidence and pose in "There Are Giants in the Earth". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+%2789+Cubs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
