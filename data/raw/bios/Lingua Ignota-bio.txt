LINGUA IGNOTA is the solo project of interdisciplinary artist, composer, and performer Kristin Hayter.

A classically-trained vocalist, she works with a variety of media and technology to create dense works harnessing the tech-mediated or acoustically extended voice, and is inspired by vernacular extreme forms such as black metal, power electronics, and harsh noise, as well as sacred and liturgical music.

LINGUA IGNOTA explores violence and gender in extreme music through a morally ambiguous, emotionally/physically intense performance practice that has been described as “crushing.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/LINGUA+IGNOTA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
