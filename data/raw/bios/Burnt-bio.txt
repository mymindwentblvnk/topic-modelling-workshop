For the past 10 years the band called BURNT has doggedly been playing their soulful blend of reggae, ska, punk and hip-hop music at venues large and small across the west coast of North America.  Building on the D.I.Y. culture of many influential punk and reggae bands before them, BURNT has managed their own tours, from Tijuana, Mexico to Victoria, B.C., and independently released 7 diverse albums of original material.  Over a decade of refinement BURNT's live sound has been distilled to its essence: raw throat, steady rhythms and a bass-heavy soul.  The sound of BURNT's albums, in contrast, weaves heady lyrics with seemingly endless variants of roots driven musical styles into a sound that, while laced with touches of the familiar, is distinctly BURNT.  Strap on your dancing boots and groove to one of the best in the California reggae music scene.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burnt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
