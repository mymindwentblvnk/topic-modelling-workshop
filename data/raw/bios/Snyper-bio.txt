techno/trance music with a pinch of psychedelic from Helsinki, Finland.
Snyper was formed during 2k by two
friends in Helsinki,Finland. The aim
was to experience ,and create unique
& energetic full on with a story.This final
mission still
as a main clue, Snyper
continues as solo-project,channeling and
releasing energies
with a twist and shake .Experiencing with
(tri)ballistical influences but still
bringing the vibe back to phat freestyle
"suomisaundi".

Also there was a UK Thrash Metal band called Snyper who released 5 demo tapes between 1988 - 1990. These were "Manifestations", "Obituary", "The Citadel", "Ephexis" & "Something Illusionary". They also appeared on a couple of compiliation LPs, "A Taste of Armageddon" and "A Nightmare on Papplewick Pond". They did record a debut LP "4 What it's Worth" but it was never released due to the lable going bust.

The UK Thrash Snyper's unreleased album finally emerged in 2013 on Mosh Tunage records with the title "Manifestations" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Snyper">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
