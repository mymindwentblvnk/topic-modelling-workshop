Robert Beatty, who may be better known as a member of Hair Police, Eyes And Arms of Smoke & a contributor to Burning Star Core, has been creating some of his most interesting material under the name Three Legged Race. His latest LP, Living Order / Mourning Order is a reissue of a pair of releases from 2006, Living Order primarily focusing on micro-tonal shifts and movement & Mourning Order setting aside most (but not all) of the tones for composition. A lesson in the beauty of modern electronics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Three+Legged+Race">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
