Biography

The journey of a rock'n'roll dinosaur Aneurysma, which was named after not very well known health disease is dating back to year 2003, when two foundation members Matej Sipkovsky and Lukas Hason started to call themselves a rock'n'roll band. Sure, it wasn't a group yet. We haven't had either bass player and drummer. However, in late 2004 Maros Hudcovic joined the group which helped us a lot, but then there's a year and half without a drummer. In may 2006, already two years after the last member was let in, Gabriel Gavalda joined the group, so after a long time the band was completed in constitution of a drummer, singer, two guitars, and bass. During early 2007 band started to roll through Slovak stages, and since August 2007 is available their first studio demo. Rock on!
