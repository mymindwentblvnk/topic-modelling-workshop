a.k.a. White Devil are veterans to the local southern Oregon music scene. The same core line-up of Jake Thrush (guitar/vocals) and Jason Mack (vocals) have gone by many names and gone through many other musicians over the years, but after the split of original members Wiatt Preston (Bass) and Kevin Smallwood (Drums), a.k.a. White Devils music has matured as has the band; into a serious frenzy of metal and blistering musicianship. Not too far gone is the aggression that gave them their controversial reputation, but that aggression is now fine tuned into a tight, innovative , new brand of metal, being dubbed locally as power core. All this is due to the addition of Matt Osgood on guitar, Ryan Smith on Bass, and Tim Wilcox on Drums, all amazing musicians in their own right and long-time friends. With this line-up the bands popularity is growing at an amazing rate with attendance at shows growing steadily. a.k.a. White Devil is tearing it up with Torture Box and are preparing to record the new songs with Circle Pit Records, in Sweethome Oregon with Jeremy of Bloodwell.
