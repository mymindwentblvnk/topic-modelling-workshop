1. The three Vulgar's principles are: each played song must have no more than 3-4 chords. Every number must last no longer than 3 minutes. And eventually - they all need to be VULGAR. The more vulgar the better and more enjoyable the song is.

For quite a long time Skull 56 couldn't manage to find musicians ready to join the band. Finally he found Doctor No. He is a drummer, but plays also the guitar and other instruments. Apart from that he knows all the angels of sound engineering and producing. Sado Skull 56 and Doctor No decided to record the material in a Doctor No's private studio. The idea was to record each song in one day - including vocals, guitars, bass, drums... They kept playing and drinking ... Up to 25 beers a song. Never had they repeated a single sound even when they were stone sober again. Except cover versions they recorded few songs written by Sado Skull 56. The whole material is released on Vulgar's limited 666 copies debut album: "This Is Punk Rock!!!

This is the resurrection of the genuine pure punk rock!!!
