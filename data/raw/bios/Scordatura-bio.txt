Scordatura is a 5 Piece Death metal band based in Glasgow.

The final line up came together in 2008 with the band's first gig in Glasgow and the release of the first 2 track demo "Garrote". Since then their sound has developed, becoming tighter and more technical through each release. Support shows came quickly: Aborted, Cryptopsy, Salt The Wound, See You Next Tuesday and Beneath The Massacre plus many more, in Glasgow venues such as the G2 and Cathouse.

In November 2009 Scordatura released thier first Ep "Open Skies" which was recorded by Pete Sneddon at Sonic Temple studios. A Scottish tour was then booked for January 2010 to promote the Ep.

Scordatura are currently writing for a full length album which they hope to release at the end of 2010.
They will be releasing a 3 track pre-production demo of the album around may/june this year aswell so be sure to check that out!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scordatura">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
