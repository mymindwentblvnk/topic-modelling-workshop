Jarun began its existence in 2008 as a one-man project of guitarist, hiding behind a pseudonym Zagreus. Originally it performed music very strongly inspired by folk, using traditional folk instruments, etc., but at some point these elements in its work began to undergo some reduction.
After various perturbations, at the end of 2010, the project radically changed its face to become a full-band. Some new musicians joined Zagreus: guitarist - Rolsen, vocalist – Meph, well known from Cracow-based death metal band Formosus, and finally Radoslav - young, talented drummer from Nowy Sącz-based, also death metal band, Pneumatic Frost.
After a period of intensive rehearsals the band went to NS Studio in Nowy Sącz to record their debut album, under the watchful eye of Piotr "Armia" Pietrzak. The recording process was quite long and full of adventure, but the final result was extremely satisfactory. The recording session took a guest appearance by Mateusz "Mateo" Kotkowski from Emergency Pilots, as at that time Jarun had not yet  permanent bass player. This position was finally appointed in February 2012 by Radogost.
Their debut album, entitled "Wziemiozstąpienie" was released officially on 28 September 2012, from the very beginning gaining the favor of audiences and earning great reviews.
Currently the band focused on the concerts and working hard on the next, hopefully, even better, material.
