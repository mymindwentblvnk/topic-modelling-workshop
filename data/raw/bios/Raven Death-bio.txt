Raven Death is a black metal beast from Slovenia, formed in 2006 by the haunted visions of Kammer and Lord Morthron. Since every vision needs to be perfected before being unleashed upon the unworthy rats of humanity, the scripts and the shapes of the fallen angels have changed since then. In the end of 2009 the first warning, entitled Forever Enslaved was given to the slaves of him, who wears the crown of thorns. But it was only the beginning. The posessed Mrk, Lord Morthron, Prometheus, Vaargh and Kammer do not intend to rest while the light is contaminating our animal nature. New shapes of Darkness are allready preparing to be unleashed when the time is right. You have only seen the first wave of the tide of blood, leaving no survivors. And this time, it will be worse. This time, the walls of your safe shelters WILL fall. The Darkness WILL be unleashed. Beware.
HAIL RAVEN DEATH!
