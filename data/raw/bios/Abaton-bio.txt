Abaton is a project created in 2009 in Forl√¨, Italy, but the current lineup is a result of many evolutions. The characteristics of their sound are a mixture of obscure and gloomy doom and sludge, with powerful hardcore openings.

The ultimate purpose of the band is to create dark and meditative atmospheres, until to scratch the most introspective and oniric side of every individual.
