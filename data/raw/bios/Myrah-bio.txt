Few years later Tiago goes to his first trance party and immediately fell in love with the music´s sounds, melodies and all the feeling that it creates.

Later, he decides to attend a two years Sound Technician Course. During that time he started to improve and better understand how to create music. Tiago played his first live act in the beginning of 2006 and since then he has been playing very frequently in a lot of parties and has become a reference in the Portuguese trance scene.
