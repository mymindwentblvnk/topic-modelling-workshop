Eddie Chacon is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and photographer.

Chacon had a fateful start at age twelve in a neighborhood garage band with childhood friends Cliff Burton (Metallica) and Mike Bordin (Faith No More), called Fry By Nyte.

He has since sold over 8 million records and wrote 11 top ten hits in various territories around the globe. Notably, he was one half of the 90's pop/soul duo Charles & Eddie, who had a worldwide number one hit with the song Would I Lie To You? (from their 1992 debut album, Duophonic). They were nominated for four Ivor Novello awards in that year and won three. They also performed and wrote the song Wounded Bird, for the classic Tarantino penned film, True Romance. The song was included in their second and final album, Chocolate Milk (1995).

In the 2000s, Chacon formed the synthpop music duo The Polyamorous Affair with his wife, Sissy Sainte-Marie. They released three critically acclaimed LPs: The Polyamorous Affair (2008), Bolshevik Disco (2009), and Strange Bedfellows (2010).

After a long break from music, Eddie recently announced the upcoming 2020 release of his first solo LP, entitled Pleasure, Joy And Happiness, produced by John Carroll Kirby (Solange, Frank Ocean, Blood Orange).
