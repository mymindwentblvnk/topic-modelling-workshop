YATES is an Australian musician, singer-songwriter currently based in Berlin and is ready to bring back another great track to our lives.
Following the promotion of his proper debut single “MAKO“, released late last year, and the interesting track “DIVE“, released last month, he’s returns with another simple but effective production.
Showing once again, his unique potential with a magnificent voice, the singer delivers a delicious and minimalist production that is ideal for a good chill session.
YATES is currently working on his debut EP, scheduled to be released sometime this year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/yates">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
