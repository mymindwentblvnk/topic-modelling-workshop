Green Lung is a heavy rock band from South London, comprised of vocalist Tom Templar, guitarist Scott Black, bassist Andrew Cave, drummer Matt Wiseman and organist John Wright. One of the most promising bands in the UK's heavy underground scene, their sound harks back to the golden days of psychedelic rock and proto-metal, injecting those classic sounds with occult venom and punk energy. They released the critically acclaimed debut album Woodland Rites in March 2019, and have shared stages with the likes of Conan, Conjurer, Primitive Man and Puppy.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Green+Lung">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
