"BIOGRAPHY

In the fall of 2007 an idea to put together a new band was born. After many musical experiments the path led to metal.

Then Wesleyer parted ways with Pain Confessor.

First to join the outfit with DC and Wesleyer was Jani. Then DC's old acquaintance from previous bands, Samppa, joined to play the bass. After several drummer candidates Jontte proved to be the perfect choice.

The spring of 2009 turned out to be a busy and profilic time for the band.

First live show was performed June 27 2009 at Tuska festival after party in Virgin Oil Co.

Once With Hate -promo was recorded at Rockstar Productions studios in August 2009.

In September Anger Cell joined Metallia Perkele Tour 2009 with Grendel, Kiana and Ghoul Patrol.

At the end of 2009 Anger Cell is writing new material and conducting preproduction for the forthcoming promotional recording."
