Colorblind are 

1) a Romanian group formed of 3 guys (and occasionally a fourth one) of Roman (NT) . They came up with the idea of the band some 2-3 years ago. Their ages vary from 17 to 19 (btw, i don't know their names :D except for the fourth occasional member, Adrian Tabus, aka Mita). They have not released any album to date, although some recordings have been spread through their friends/relatives.
