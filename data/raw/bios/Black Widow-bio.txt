There are multiple artists with this name:

1) Black Widow was a progressive rock / hard rock band formed in Leicester, England, UK in September 1969. The band was mostly known for its use of satanic and occult imagery in their music and stage act. Black Widow was often compared with the better-known hard rock band Black Sabbath, but the bands were only superficially similar.
The group originally formed in 1966 as Pesky Gee! with Kay Garrett (lead vocals), Kip Trevor (lead vocals, guitar & harmonica), Jim Gannon (guitar & vocals), Bob Bond (bass guitar), Clive Box (drums), Jess "Zoot" Taylor (organ & piano), Clive Jones (sax & flute). The band released one album for Pye Records as Pesky Gee!, 1969's Exclamation Mark, before Garrett left the band. The remaining band members continued on as Black Widow and released their debut album Sacrifice in 1970. Perhaps better known than their music was the band's use of occult references in their music and their live performances, which were made more controversial with the mock sacrifice of a nude woman. The band attracted further controversy by consulting infamous witch Alex Sanders for advice.
