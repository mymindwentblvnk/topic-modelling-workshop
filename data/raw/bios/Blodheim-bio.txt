Blodheim was formed from the corpse of Kaleva (KalEVO) in Finland in the exchange of years 2006-2007. The band plays Death/Thrash-metal with Viking theme. The band started the recordings of their first demo in June 2007. The demo was never released, and after one year, the band became a pagan black metal-duo and it continued making music under the name of Tanngnost. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blodheim">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
