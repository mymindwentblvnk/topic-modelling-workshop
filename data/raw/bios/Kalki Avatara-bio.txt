Kalki Avatara is Paolo Pieri's solo project (also in Shoreborn, Malfeitor, Promaetheus Unbound). In september 2007, found the right conditions, with the help of such musicians like Nighthorn (Hour Of Penance, Malfeitor, Lord Vampyr) on bass guitar, Francesco “Aeshla” Struglia (Promaetheus Unbound, Fleshgod Apocalypse, Lord Vampyr) on drums, and with the guest appearance of Malfeitor Fabban (Aborym, Malfeitor) on vocals on the track “Awaiting the golden age”, Kalki Avatara enters the Fear No 1 Studios owned by Emiliano Natali (www.myspace.com/fearnoonestudios ) to bring this project to life.

Lyrically speaking, is a concept about Kali-Yuga and how mankind denied the Truth, being slave to the material world while killing its spiritual and divine part. Lyrics consist of fragments of poetries by T.S. Eliot, Novalis and excerpts from Johannes evangelion and hindu mantras. The music is a mystical travel through the ruins of our civilization. To accomplish this vision, Kalki Avatara put together musical influences from different lands and ages, from late romanticism to atonal works, from indian ragas to russian folk, experimental metal and even progressive and fusion.
