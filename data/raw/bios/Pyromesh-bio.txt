Pyromesh are an aurally intense metal band hailing from the desolate streets of Perth, Australia that craft a highly unique sound best described as both melodic and abrasive, blistering and serene, epic and progressive. They combine a double-guitar attack with authoritative bass, vicious drumming, acidic vocals and wall-of-sound song composition to create music that must be heard to be believed.

Pyromesh have been metal heavyweights since their emphatic launch into the scene in late 2001 due to their huge sound supported by a chaotic and energetic stage show. Hard choices, lineup shuffles and a thirst for success has seen Pyromesh evolve into the grinding and resilient machine that it is today.

Their debut album, Omnia, features eight tracks comprising a 45 minute journey into the realms of chaos, destruction and apathy. Meticulously produced to an international standard, Omnia is a rich and textural album that reveals something new on each spin as the listener travels through the many layers of instrumentation and orchestration. Finely packaged in a lavishly illustrated fold-out case and accompanying booklet, Omnia is a must have album for the metal enthusiast and music-lover alike. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pyromesh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
