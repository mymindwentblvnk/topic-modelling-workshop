Ought is a band formed in Montreal, Canada.

Guitarist and vocalist Tim Darcy, originally a folk musician hailing from New Hampshire, fell in with New Jersey native Matt May (keyboards) and Australian émigré Tim Keen (drums, violin) – the three of them began sharing an apartment that doubled as practice space, where they were soon joined by Portland,OR transplant Ben Stidworthy on bass. Ought played its first show and recorded its first "New Calm EP"  in the apartment's largest bedroom, in the summer of 2012. The band busted out into the city's loft circuit, and into the city streets during the Printemps d'Erable Quebec student general strike, in the spring of the same year.

Following another recording session in early 2013 and the release of a second EP via Bandcamp, Ought spent a few days at the Hotel2Tango studio with engineer Radwan Moumneh (Suuns, Matana Roberts, Jerusalem In My Heart) in fall 2013 at the invitation of Constellation, laying down a clutch of songs new and old that comprise the band's first "proper" full-length album. More Than Any Other Day was released by Constellation on April 29, 2014.

A 24-minute, four-track EP followed on October 28. Once More With Feeling... was released as a 10" and digital. Pill was chosen as the title track.

The group announced they'd split in 2021; Darcy and Stidworthy formed Cola with drummer Evan Cartwright.
