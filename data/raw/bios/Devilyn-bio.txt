Devilyn is a brutal death metal band from Poland, originally from Tarn√≥w and now operating within an area of Warsaw. They formed under the name Cerebral Concussion.

Devilyn was founded in 1992 by "Bony" (rhythm guitar) and Marcin "Novy" Nowak (bass guitar). Under the name Cerebral Concussion they released their first demo, The Rule. In 1996 the name was turned to Devilyn and the first album Anger was recorded. In 1998 Devilyn went on a European tour with Cannibal Corpse and Krabathor. In the same year they recorded a new album, Reborn in Pain. In 2001, Artefact was released. After that, conflict between "Bony" and "Novy" resulted in Devilyn disbanding.

However, in 2005, Devilyn came together without "Novy" and released a new album entitled 11 or XI. Currently they are recording under the label, Conquer Records.
