Black/thrash/doom metal from Asturias, Spain

https://totengott.bandcamp.com/

Darkness. Experimentation. Heaviness. Artistic integrity. A band that is born as a tribute to swiss titans Celtic Frost should have all these concepts as a basic reference when working on their own music. Formed in 2014 by three “off-road” musicians with a vast experience in metal, rock and hardcore bands of Asturias (Spain), Totengott raises in the middle of the self-indulgent metal scene in order to claim the importance of evil and morbidity ofcompositions above technique, rawness above demonstration. An obsolete but effective speech.

It wasn’t long when their setlist, initially formed by classics (and “not-too-classics”) from Celtic Frost, started giving way to their own songs. Songs in which, although the “Warrior universe” touch is undeniable, we can also hear other influences like the space madness of Voivod, the gravity of Conan, the experimentation of early Pink Floyd albums, the riffing mastery of Candlemass or the atonality of Kryzstof Penderecki. Occult metal with obvious doom / death influences, but as we say, these are not the only ones: thrash, ambient, gothic... Totengott avoids limitations in the way they understand music.

In only two years they have managed to form a solid base of fans in the metal underground scene of their area.
They have already shared stage with bands like Sodom, Entombed AD, Minsk, Holy Moses, Angelus Apatrida, Horn of the rhino, Bodybag, Kowloon Walled City or Wolvserpent and they preached their musical philosophy widely in the north of Spain. This ode to darkness is depicted in “Demo 2016”, a three song / 43 minutes long recording that serves as an introduction to Totengott before they record their first album during the autumn of 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Totengott">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
