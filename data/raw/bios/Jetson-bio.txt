Jetson is one person, and writes songs when his other band projects aren't full steam ahead. Jetson music is generally thought-based and music driven. The lyrics are important in a society that operates in a certain way, the music is mostly a reaction to it. It can bring you up to certain places and bring you down from others. He's never left the United States. He has a few places he'd like to go. Jetson is only a nickname, but it's better than just a name, because there are thousands of those out there. The music is there for you to enjoy and he enjoys when you enjoy, it helps the enjoyment of making the music carry on a bit longer. Hope you love something, that will make me keep making it. Jetson. Now submitting daily poetry posts and, hopefully, daily songs.
