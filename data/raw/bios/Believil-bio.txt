Believil formed in late 2007 in Trento, Italy, when Sam and two more musicians  - all from different bands and largely differing genres - team up to form a violent trio dedicated to fast and brutal metal sounds such as those of Overkill, Kreator, Slayer, Exodus and Nevermore.
Enter Lenny Verga in 2008, who, coming from a black metal band, helps the band take their sound to new, shiny metal heights.

Stay tuned for more news!
