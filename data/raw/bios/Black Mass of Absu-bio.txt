Black Mass of Absu was headed by a mysterious figure named "Mr. Ski Mask". He was somewhat known in the more obscure noisecore/industrial scene for his band Ostomy; he also has a metal project called Towpath and is somewhat well known in New York state for his public access program, Thunderbird Theatre.

The other band members are unknown, though, and it's unknown which persona Mr. Ski Mask assumes in Black Mass of Absu. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Mass+of+Absu">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
