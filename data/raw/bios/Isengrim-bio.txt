Isengrim (FIN) was formed during fall 2004 by Thanatar and Wintry. Music was first inspired by few dark metal acts, but soon evolved to an harsh individual and satanic black metal with a progressive touch. Few recordings was made without a success, but in summer 2007, mcd Mustan Jumalan Rukous was recorded, with a proper sounds and in spirit of 90's Norwegian Black Metal. Lyrical themes involve a criticism towards feeble flesh with weak spirit, personal mental issues and of Satan in all it's power in human veins. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Isengrim">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
