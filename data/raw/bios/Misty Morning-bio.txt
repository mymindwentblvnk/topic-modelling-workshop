The musical entity "Misty Morning" was born in the far 1995 from the mind of Luca Moretti who, together with Massimo Vendittozzi, decided to give sonic form to the strange agitations of their souls. At the dawn of the year 2007, after more than one decade of musical experiences and parallel projects, Francesco de Dominicis finally joined the duo. The agreement of this three-some, held together by the shared influences of the individuals, gives life to the musical alchemy of the band, that after a year of live exhibitions and studio work, recorded the lysergic testimonies and the mystic visions of Martian Pope. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MISTY+MORNING">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
