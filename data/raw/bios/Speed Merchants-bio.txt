The band was founded by Hellscream, Bestial Penetrator and Vrag in winter of 2013. Soon after that, Skullcrusher and Killer Smile were added to the line-up. Named after Razor's song and heavily influenced by fast and faceripping old school speed and thrash metal, they started playing covers of such bands as Overkill, Exodus, Whiplash, Dark Angel, Anvil and, of course, Razor. The band is currently writing songs for their first EP, which is set for release in summer of 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Speed+Merchants">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
