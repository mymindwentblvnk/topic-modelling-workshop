Dawn Of Valor is a traditional metal band from Saint Paul, MN, founded in 2008 by guitarists John Leibel and Seth Kuschel. The two quickly started jamming with vocalist and best friend, Sean Iredale. After writing some songs and creating a name, Dawn Of Valor was born. Soon bassist Ted Jedlicki and drummer Phil Frazier joined, and DOV was ready to take the stage. They quickly gained success on the local scene by wining a series of battle of the bands, and by their 3rd show were opening Paganfest II. The next year saw many great gigs and a debut EP, however drummer Phil Frazier left to focus on his main band Lockgnar. After a year of 2 replacement drummers in 2010, DOV finally found a fit in Joe Waller, who's style, sensibilities, and skills are a perfect fit. Finally with the right drummer in the band, DOV unleashed the fury in early 2011. But as the band was starting to move forward it lost 2 original members, Seth and Sean due to musical differences. With many new songs written, the band decided to soldier on and found new life with singer Jaden Adair and co lead guitarist Andrew Johnson. The new lineup spent much of the 2011 summer recording their 2nd EP: Immortal Flame.
