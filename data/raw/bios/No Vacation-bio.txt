No Vacation is a indie pop band based in San Francisco, U.S.A.. The band started as a dorm room collaboration between Basil Saleh and Sabrina Mai before evolving into a band. After a year long hiatus, No Vacation has re-emerged from hibernation. As they quietly work on their next album and transition out of San Francisco, No Vacation will bring their novice sounds to New York City, U.S.A.. The majority of the still untitled album was written during No Vacationâ€™s break up and expresses the feelings of belongingness, regret, and struggles of resilience. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/no+vacation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
