[3] Horror is a Progressive Black/Death Metal band from New York City that began in 2009. 

Horror officially began when two demos were released online in 2010 through various social networks and websites on the internet. 

In mid 2011 Horror released the first official EP 'Backwards Knife' featuring improved production over the demos and an obscure take on the typical Black/Death metal sound focused on "subtle brutality" and aggressively haunting vocals. 

Shortly after, in late 2011, Horror released their first full album 'Ignorance Is Death' featuring higher production values, a longer length and more diversity over the first album. 

A third album 'Artificially Alive' was released by Horror in July 2012 and featured 8 new tracks with a noticeably less colorful album cover than the previous. 

At the end of Spring 2013, Horror released "Everyone Trying To Kill You" which along with the first three releases are still receiving recognition from underground metal blogs, webzines and social media. 

A new album "Kill Me, I'm Them" was released March 11th, 2014. Christopher Ferreira, the mastermind behind the project, has stated there will be a longer period of time before the next album is released but the recording has already started
