Founded in Vancouver, B.C. by Johnny Philippon (drums) and Jesse Wainwright (guitar), State of Shock has honed its sound with Cameron Melnyk (vocals), Alison Toews (bass), and Simon "Kadooh" Clow (guitar).

State of Shock's debut album "Guilty By Association" was released June 2004 and led to a 2005 Canadian Music Award nomination for Favourite New Group.

Currently touring for its second album, "Life, Love and Lies", the band has been buoyed by its lead single, Money Honey, which has led to radio exposure nationwide, a 2008 Juno nomination for Best New Group, three nominations for Canadian Radio Music Awards, and opening slots for Nickelback and Aerosmith.  

The second single from "Life Love and Lies" is Hearts That Bleed, which is currently gaining popular support across Canada. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/State+of+Shock">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
