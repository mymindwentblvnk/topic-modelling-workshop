Joy Again are based in Philadelphia and is made up of: singer/guitarist Sachi DiSerafino, singer/guitarist Arthur Shea, bassist Blase O'Brien, keyboardist Tyndall, and drummer Will Butera

The group tends to draw inspiration for their own sound from other Philadelphia musicians. They met one another at a boogie boarding competition that was hosted by rapper Jay-Z in New Jersey, and came together in an online chat room on a pro-longboarding forum.

In 2014 Joy Again jumped into their debut album. Forever <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joy+Again">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
