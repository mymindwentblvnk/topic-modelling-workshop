This Athens, GA metal band is in transition as lead guitarist Ryan Knight has joined Arsis and they have booted their singer and lost several bass players since recording The Annihilation of Expectation.  The core group of Knight, guitarist Ryan McCullough and drummer Brian Switzer remains and they plan to record a full length in the winter of 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Knife+Trade">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
