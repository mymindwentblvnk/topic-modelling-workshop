Cosmin Nicolae's debut first as TRG came in 2002 at the TMBASE Festival in Timisoara, Romania. He is one of the first musicians to have constantly released records outside Romania and play a key-role in contemporary electronic music.

TRG has caused a stir not only in the bass-heavy music scene, but also in most electronica areas which share a passion for fresh new sounds, addictive grooves and dancefloor-shattering basslines.

His first 12" on Hessle Audio garnered the attention of BBC Radio 1's Mary Anne Hobbs among others, and labels soon got on his case: Hotflush, Cool&Deadly, This Is Music, Against The Grain, Tempa, Soul Jazz, ~scape, Fabric, Marine Parade and even the mighty Bpitch Control have turned to TRG for singles, remixes and licensing.

A fan of early dark garage as well as futuristic electronica, TRG re-invents his music constantly, and currently champions an eclectic 4/4 sound supported by the likes of Sinden, MJ Cole, Zed Bias, Freq Nasty, Rob Da Bank, Tayo, Coldcut, Laurent Garnier, Mary Anne Hobbs and Modeselektor among others. An alumni of the illustrious Red Bull Music Academy Toronto 2007 and a regular in music magazines such as Mixmag, DJ, iDJ, Groove, FACT, Resident Advisor and Pitchfork, TRG has taken his unique take on interesting dancefloor music to clubs and festivals including The End, Fabric, Flex, WMF, Sonar, Monegros and the notorious Paris Techno Parade. On the remix front, TRG has been drafted to bring his unique touch on tracks by Deekline, Tayo, Baobinga, Mujava, Adam Freeland and Moderat among others.

TRG has been included in the recently published 100 To Watch: A Directory of Contemporary Romanian Artists.

Cosmin Nicolae is also an awarded writer having published 3 books of poetry and numerous articles and essays between 1994 and 1999. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TRG">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
