Ravnsang was founded in October 2006 by Eiwaz and Fenrisulfur. The first line-up was different from Today. Meldric made the drums and Fenrisulfur the Guitar. After a break Ravnsang was on search for new members. Soon Rabenblut joined as Lead-Guitarist. In January 2007 Hessaia decided to make the drums for Ravnsang, and with him Ravnsang became a room for exercising and recording. A few weeks later Nidh√∂ggr become Rhytms-Guitarist and Eiwaz decided to leave Ravnsang. So Fenrisulfur took care of the vocals. The Band started to work on their first Demo with the current line-up. The themes in the Ravnsang songs are about nature, paganism, anti-christianity filled with atmospheric sound and harsh-vocals. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ravnsang">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
