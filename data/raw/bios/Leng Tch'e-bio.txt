A fixture in the European grindcore scene for more than 10 years, LENG TCH'E was formed in 2001 by members of ABORTED and underground cult band ANAL TORTURE. Basing their own hybrid of grindcore on bands such as REGURGITATE, HEMDALE, NASUM and BLOOD DUSTER and mixing it all up with some stoner / rock / hardcore influences, the band baptized their own unique style, now known as “razorgrind”. After quickly gaining a large underground following through the release of a split 7” and two full length albums, LENG TCH'E became widely recognized with their third album "The Process of Elimination" (Relapse Records, 2005), which was mixed by Tue Madsen (THE HAUNTED, ABORTED, DARK TRANQUILITY). Hooks that sink into your brain accompanied some of the fastest and most extreme grind to emerge in years as LENG TCH'E proved that grindcore can continue to evolve, while staying true to its formative roots. The Belgians were rewarded with festival shows among others at Furyfest, Graspop, Summerbreeze and Maryland Deathfest as well as worldwide touring. Their next output "Marasmus" (Relapse Records, 2007) saw LENG TCH'E adding more heaviness and pronounced Death Metal riffing. Mixed by Fredrik Nordström (AT THE GATES, IN FLAMES) "Marasmus" put LENG TCH'E squarely at the forefront of the modern extreme scene. With their fifth album "Hypomanic" (Season Of Mist, 2010), produced by Russ Russell (NAPALM DEATH, BRUJERIA, DIMMU BORGIR) Belgium's hardest hitting bunch honed its brutal yet clever Deathgrind to a new level of perfection. The band was rewarded with numerous festival appearances such as Deathfeast, Moscow Deathfest, Neurotic Deathfest, Metalfest and Obscene Extreme and a month long European tour with ORIGIN and PSYCROPTIC. Get into the grind!
