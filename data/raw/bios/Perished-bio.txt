Norway's extreme metallers Perished can easily be placed in the black end of metal yet they refuse to do so out of respect for "the good old bands".

Perished formed back in 1991 and since then the line-up seems to have changed from year to year with members leaving and extra members taken in. Founding member Bruthor (bass) is still with the band, together with Bahtyr (vocals) and Jehmod  (drums) who joined in '92. 

Then their slow process of releasing material finally started… Perished's first demo "In Hoc Signo Vinces" was released in '93 with their second demo "Through the Black Mist" following only a couple of months later. They finally got a deal with the German label Solistitium Records for one 7" and one full length album, which resulted in an untitled EP (released in '96) and their debut album "Kark" (released in ‘97). 

The EP "Grim" was released in 2000 through Apocalyptic Empire Records who signed Perished for this one EP only.

Displeased Records had a little more faith and currently have the band on a two-album contract, with the first one, "Seid" released in 2003.

As usual there has been little activity from the Perished-camp after this release, but rumors say their plan is to go "back to the basics" - sounding more like their untitled 7".
