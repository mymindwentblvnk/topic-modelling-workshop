There are 5 bands called The Answer:

1) Classic rock band from Northern Ireland
2) Hardcore band from Seattle, WA, USA
3) Thrash metal band from Dallas, TX, USA
4) Garage band from the US
5) Hardcore band from Lima, Peru

(1) The Answer hail from Newcastle and Downpatrick, County Down, Northern Ireland, producing a classic rock sound with big guitars and even bigger vocals.  They won Classic Rock Magazine's, Best New Band of 2005 award. 

Obviously influenced by 70s hard rock artists like Led Zeppelin, Thin Lizzy and Deep Purple and the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, singer Cormac Neeson's powerful vocals are reminiscent of Robert Plant, Paul Rodgers or Ronnie James Dio. When playing live they produce a varied set, combining hard rock songs with modernised blues covers.

The band played at a Phil Lynott memorial benefit gig in Dublin, as Lynott’s mother is a big fan. So big in fact that she allowed bass player Micky Waters to be the first since Lynott’s death to open his case and play the legendary black bass within. It’s the same instrument that appears in the music video for Keep Believin'. 

The song "Never Too Late" is a playable song in Guitar Hero IV (Video Game).
Cormac Neeson - Vocals
