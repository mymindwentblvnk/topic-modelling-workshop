Alex Zhang Hungtai, a Taiwanese-born Canadian lo-fi musician based in Lisbon,Portugal  created the project Dirty Beaches in 2005. 

Like Bo Diddley or minimalist synth provocateurs Suicide, Dirty Beaches’ compositions were not so much stripped down as refined to their essence. Drum loops, Hungtai’s croon, and the yearning melodies draped overtop belie as much a sense of haunting mystery as they do romanticism and wry humour.

In November 2014 Alex Zhang Hungtai announced the end of Dirty Beaches.He performed one of his last concerts in GNRation, in Braga, Portugal. 

Since 2016 he is releasing music again, under his birth name. He most notably released a tape – Knave of Hearts – on Ascetic House and a highly-acclaimed album, Divine Weight on NON Worldwide. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dirty+Beaches">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
