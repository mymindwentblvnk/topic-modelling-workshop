The Galleria is a large indoor shopping mall with an a full arcade and food court. Shopping floors are color-coded and accessible from glass elevators and interconnected walkways. Escalators are temporarily out of order and our anchor store has gone out of business. Strawberry lip gloss is on sale. These are your sticky years.

The Galleria is a new project from Morgan Geist (Storm Queen, Metro Area) that ripples with echoes of the indigenous music of long-dead suburban New Jersey shopping malls and NYC radio stations: bombastic freestyle, club dubs, razor-edits and bubblegum-pop R&B. The debut release, Calling Card / Mezzanine, features vocals from Jessy Lanza, whose debut album on Hyperdub, Pull My Hair Back, was a shortlisted nominee for the 2014 Polaris Music Prize. Each title features a dancefloor-friendly dub with plenty of jump-cuts for the forward-thinking nostalgic. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Galleria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
