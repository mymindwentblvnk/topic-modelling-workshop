Mary Timony is an artist whose career is inextricably linked to historic punk and indie rock bands from the American underground in the 80's and 90's. Starting out in Dischord's dreamy femme pop outfit Autoclave, she went on to be the frontwoman of Matador's Helium. Helium released 2 albums and a 4 other CD/EP /7" records. Mary Timony then released 2 solo albums on Matador, most recently, 2002's The Golden Dove. After living in Boston, Mary has returned to her old residence, DC, and formed a new duo with drummer Devin Ocampo of Dischord's Medications. The pair play post-rock compositions which highlight Mary's unique guitar wizardry, and Devin's elegant and intelligent drum work. The new songs aren't like anything else out there: expect to be amazed. The new album "Ex Hex" was produced by Brendan Canty of Fugazi. It's slated for a-mid April 2005 release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Mary+Timony+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
