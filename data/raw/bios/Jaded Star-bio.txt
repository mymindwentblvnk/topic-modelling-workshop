Athens 2013-present.

    When there was nothing left but us, we came together. From distant corners of the scorched and ruined Earth, as remnant, persistent shards of life and light, we merged and melded in an atomic collision that shot us into the outer cosmos to safety and surety, where we rested and regrouped, determined to one day avenge our devastated home.
