Translated as “simple” in Welsh, SYML is the creation of Brian Fennell, Seattle-native and founding member of the band Barcelona. With a keen grasp on textural and emotive songwriting, Fennell combines bare piano, minimalist synth and string-scapes, and etherial vocals to create the sounds of SYML. Accumulating many previous placements in TV and film with Barcelona, Fennell is no stranger to crafting songs that evoke movement and image when you close your eyes. Ranging from dark to light and sad to hopeful, SYML’s songs are sure to take the listener on a journey through the senses.
