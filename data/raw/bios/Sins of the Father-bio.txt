Sins Of The Father are a power hungry 5-piece dedicated to bringing heavy as lead and brutal as murder metal to the local metal punters of Perth and beyond.

Sins Of The Father started way back in 2003 with Matt, Luke and Jords jamming on staple classics by Black Sabbath, Metallica, System Of A Down, Pantera and Sepultura.

After a few line up additions and subtractions good friend Dan decided to learn bass and quickly progressed into a young Geezer.

Singers came and went and no-one could identify with our groove, swing and brutality until ex-Dethlahem crooner Mick was added to the line up thus completing Sin Of The Father. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sins+Of+The+Father">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
