Young Dreams are a symphonic pop ensemble from Bergen, Norway, headed up by the mighty Matias Tellez. With a lineup of musicians that starts at seven and blossoms to as many as twelve at any given performance, they’ve already captured the imaginations of dreamy pop lovers internationally via just a couple of limited but potent releases, including the self-titled single ‘Young Dreams’, which was seen on Pitchfork, Stereogum, Nylon, The Fader, Dummy, The Guardian, and KEXP. 

Pitchfork said this about the first single "Fog of War" from their upcoming debut album:

"Not empty, because of our young dreams" went the eponymous single from Norweigan orchestral poppers Young Dreams, and it was a fittingly epic statement of purpose. The track was airy, populous (though helmed by Matias Tellez, there are as many as twelve people in the collective's shifting line-up), and earnest enough to make you realize how much you wish Arcade Firesomeday record a cover of "In a Big Country". New track "Fog of War" is perhaps even more of an anthem than its predecessor, blowing up youthful, violently impassioned longings for freedom to the size of a flare-streaked sky.

And as rippling synths, floating strings and well-timed tambourine hits suspend in the air around him, the track perfectly captures that slow motion feeling of being fed up with your surroundings ("There's nothing here that's clear to me") full of expectations, waiting for life to begin. It's a difficult mood to capture well, but these Norweigans live up to all the bombast: they've got a sound as hopeful-- and huge-- as teenage dreams."
