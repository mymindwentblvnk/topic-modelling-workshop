Wojczech started off in mid-1995 playing simple grindpunk after forming from other bands already together since 1991. A project that started out without expecting anything big developed to a full band, quickly getting in touch with the Hcnetwork all over the globe. A couple of friends shared their similar ideas of musical expression in opposition to the 21st-century civilization, criticizing its decay as well as calling for something more constructive than swimming in daily boredom. That band played music similar to nihilist hardcore, with a spirit some may liken to punk, but with a grind drive. 

The lyrics mostly reflected misanthropic states of being, ranging from personal cynicism to political topics. Wojczech does their best to avoid apathy and self-indulgence or self-pity, as well as avoid cliches. Wojczech has played around 500 shows on 3 continents so far, and looks forward to meeting you in a distant smoky hole. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/wojczech">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
