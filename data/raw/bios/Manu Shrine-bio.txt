Sergey Deulin 1987-2015 RIP

 "About a year ago musical creativity was a nice bonus to the everyday pace, and after another has become a reliable way to release what my path sometimes accumulates in me in the face emotions, thoughts, and just the fact of feeling life. I have no logic or strong long-term plans, just a hobby - which manifests itself as the availability of time and impulses. therefore took it easy and pleasant listening. " Sergei Deulin (Manu Shrine)
