Martin Luke Brown is a singer-songwriter from Leicester who's songwriting represents his classic influences. His first single, Nostalgia is a song that reflected the experiences of his friends who were finishing university or leaving home, but which possesses a universal theme that reflects the experiences that almost everyone shares.

Martin admires artists like Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles and The Beatles because they often wrote really unifying songs. He thinks that there was something much deeper to their songs than just the music, whether that be a political message or a theme that wasn't so commonly explored."

As a child, Martin would absorb the sounds of his parents' record collection: The Kinks, ELO, Simon & Garfunkel and their contemporaries – "My parents were Sixties kids and that really rubbed off on me" – and he'd often be found playing the family's piano rather than listening to music himself. He acknowledges the likes of Paolo Nutini, George Ezra, Adele and Sam Smith as contemporary artists that he admires for their honesty, but he's more likely to spin some Motown or Northern Soul if he has a quiet Sunday afternoon.
