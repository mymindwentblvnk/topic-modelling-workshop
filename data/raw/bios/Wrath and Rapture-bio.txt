The metal maelstrom known as Wrath and Rapture was brought to life one dark and stormy night in early 2006 by 5 young men on a mission to give American metal a major overhaul. Brought together by the common bonds of music while still in high school, founding guitarists Kenan Livermont and Nick Staley began writing and rehearsing in 2003 while still teenagers. After an intensive search a drummer was found right under their noses in the form of classmate and athlete extraordinaire Scott Shelton. Shortly thereafter long time friend Jay Thullbery was asked to join to fulfill keyboard and synthesizer duties. This left the need for the perfect vocalist to be found. On a whim Scott's best friend and partner in crime Sheldon Smith was asked to audition, completely surprising the band with his energy and brutality and putting the finishing touches on a band ready to take the country by storm. Bred from the fertile metal roots of North Carolina, which by the turn of the century had already seen the establishment of major acts and trendsetters such as Prayer for Cleansing, Between the Buried and Me, and Undying, Wrath and Rapture has set out to raise the bar for a new generation of metalheads. By combining in your face death metal with traces of Scandinavian Black and Power metal the Wrath is a force to be reckoned with. Adding to the mix a melodic side with influences of Rock, Jazz, and Classical music the Rapture will lull you into a false sense of security right before bringing back the devastation and fury. In late 2009 the band will unleash their self-titled debut album on Tragic Hero Records and will be touring the US extensively to support it. Wrath and Rapture are prepared and waiting to bring complete annihilation to your hometown, which leaves only one question . . .
