Embryonic Devourment formed in 2003 from the ashes of Ye Old Skabbard with founding members Lauren Pike and Luke Boutiette. After 8 months of writing and playing they agreed to add former Ciribus members Johnny Helvete (vocals) and Austin Spence (bass). In November/December 2003 they recorded the demo "Beheaded by Volition", recorded and engineered by Juan Urteaga of the band VILE, which quickly got them signed to Grotesque Music.

In mid 2007 Embryonic Devourment finished recording their debut full length album entitled “Fear of Reality Exceeds Fantasy”, recorded and engineered by Matt Sotelo of Decrepit Birth, and mastered by Colin Davis of VILE. The album was released in Febuary 2008 on Deepsend Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Embryonic+Devourment">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
