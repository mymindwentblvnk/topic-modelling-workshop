Hailing from Jacksonville, Florida, Skyliner is a hurricane of any and all shades of traditional and power metal, with a progressive mind's eye at the center of the storm. No regard for current trends. No regrets about taking chances. Lyrically esoteric, insightful, or emotionally shipwrecked, a tide of vocal wails and roars collides with pure toned, high-volume guitars, bass, and drums, an alchemical marriage recalling the classic era of heavy and power metal while adding new stones onto that long-established foundation - for the future, for the music, for the songs, for the soul.
At its dark heart, Skyliner is a tide of discontent and a voyage to freedom, and the tempest has now arrived to devastate all islands of fraud. The waves are shifting. The condition - black. 
You've been warned.
