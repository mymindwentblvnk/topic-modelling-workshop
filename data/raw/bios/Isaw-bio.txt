Our Sound:
ISAW don’t pretend to belong to any one specific genre or sub-genre of metal as it's becoming increasingly difficult to define the lines of these styles. Alternatively we prefer to develop our own flavour of metal drawing influence from numerous genres. Each band member brings an independent background in taste and experience varying from rock, metal core, extreme metal, thrash, and death metal.

Having said that we draw more significant influence from bands including the following (in no particular order): Machine Head, Mnemic, Pantera, Strapping Young Lad, Metallica, Mudvayne, Chimaira, Meshuggah, Scarve, Parkway Drive, & Killswitch Engage.

Our Passion:
Each member has a great deal of respect and admiration for any artist of considerable talent or genius, regardless of style or genre. Subsequently we collectively aspire to create music that pushes our own creative and physical boundaries while maintaining a delicate balance of musicality and song craftsmanship. Tie this together with a passion for creating the most amazing sounding production and you have ISAW defined in a nut shell.
