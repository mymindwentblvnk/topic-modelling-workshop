Consfearacy formed in the spring of 2009 when lead vocalist Brian O’Connor, (ex- lead vocalist of U.S. metal group Vicious Rumors) and guitarist Fabian Schwarz (of German rock band The New Black) set out to create and perform a transatlantic style of metal and expand their musical collaborations worldwide, thus Consfearacy was born. Soon after, talented like-minded professional musicians joined the group’s ranks; Guenter Auschrat, bassist (The New Black, Abandoned); Ira Black, guitarist (ex- Vicious Rumors, Lizzy Borden, Metal Church); and drummer extraordinaire Timo Weis. Uniting East with West, Consfearacy writes about controversial topics surrounding conspiracy theories, the new world order, religions, relationships, and end of days prophecies.

Consfearacy produced, recorded and mixed their self-titled promo CD in 2010 in their home studios and mastered it with Achim Koehler in Germany, producing a heavy power-tech-thrash metal formula, featuring heavy and soaring dynamic vocals, technical attacking melodic guitars, driving bass and precision drumming. Together, these well-established international recording artists have created an undeniable metal force.

Collectively, these musicians have completed countless records, dvd’s, tours, radio airplay, magazine/press coverage and festival performances to thousands of fans worldwide. They have supported, headlined and toured with major acts in the U.S. and Europe such as DIO, Aerosmith, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Megadeth, Blind Guardian, Twisted Sister, Scorpions, Queensryche, Motorhead, Black Sabbath and more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Consfearacy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
