London
Slow Motion Records

System Olympia was born and raised in another girl’s mind. 
It’s night rides in an old white vintage Mercedes benz, a sloppy kiss in a club when the lights come on, a messy bed in a calm bedroom in the middle of the city. 
It’s warm seashores and abstract sunrises delayed to the infinite.
A soundtrack for after dark awakenings.
