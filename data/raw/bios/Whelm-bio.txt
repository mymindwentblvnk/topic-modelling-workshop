1.  Whelm was formed back in 2002 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The intention was to fuse darkness, atmosphere & brutality into one crushing wave. The inspiration came in many forms and the music soon took it's own turn, holding elements of sludge, death-doom metal, post-hardcore & psychedelic rock.

November 2004, Whelm arrived in SoundZone Studio, to record their first first demo, which however wasn't released until 2006 titled The Prologue. The lineup for these recordings consisted of Atli Brix Kamban (The Shallow Man), Mikkel Putzek, Casper Axilgård, Dave Müller (Chasing Eudaimonia, Black Wreath) and Jonas Manley. Later on the track A State of Decay from this recording session got a place on the "Asymmetry Compilation", which was released through Total Rust Records. 

Dave Müller and Jonas Manley left the band soon after the recording of "The Prolougue". 
Alex Falkesgard on bass joined the band

The first full-length A Gaze Blank And Pitiless As The Sun was released on 05. June 2013, although the band split up in June 2012
