Ritual Torture is a death/thrash band spawned from four sadistic minds in San Diego on April 2008, California. Ritual Torture creates an apocalyptic atmosphere with their punishing, take-no-prisoners rhetoric. With fast, thrashing riffage, a relentless drumming onslaught, and a malevolent dual vocal assault.
