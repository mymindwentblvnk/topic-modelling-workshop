Highlight is a South Korean group formerly known as BEAST. It consists of Doojoon, Yoseob, Gikwang and Dongwoon. Original member Hyunseung left the group in April 2016, before the remaining members moved labels from Cube Entertainment to their own label Around Us later that year and subsequently changed their name to Highlight and re-debuted in 2017 with the mini-album CAN YOU FEEL IT?. On March 14th 2019, Junhyung announced his departure due to the rumors bringing up his name in the Jung Joonyoung chatroom scandal but it was proven later on that he was not involved. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/HIGHLIGHT">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
