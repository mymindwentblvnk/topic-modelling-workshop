'Avicii is kind of like Dante’s Inferno … it’s the lowest level of hell in Buddhism. A friend of mine told me about it, and it stuck in my head. I was going to make up a name for my MySpace page for the first time, and I just kind of went for it. I tried a couple of other before, but they were all taken (laughing). I kind of ended up with Avicii, and then I got really attached to it.' <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Berg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
