Formed in Summer 2006, by Kev Robinson (Vocals/Bass/Keyboards), Jim McClelland (Guitar/Vocals), and Mike Ellis(Drums/Vocals). Johnny Miller joined the trio on Guitar, and the band wrote and recorded their debut CD 'Razor's Edge'. Johnny sadly had to leave because of work commitments, and was replaced by Paul Doherty. Jeff Downey completed the line up January 2008, just two weeks before the bands first gig at the Maryport Blues Festival Battle of the Bands. The guys spent the rest of 2008 writing new material, and playing a few specially selected gigs. These included headlining at a charity night at the Brickyard in Carlisle, playing the Senhouse Street Stage at the Maryport Blues Festival, and The White Mare Rock Festival. The band then headed for the studio to record the new album. In 2009 they became the first band to top the CFM radio 'unsigned artist' chart, and they reached the final of the Maryport Blues Festival Battle of the Bands.
