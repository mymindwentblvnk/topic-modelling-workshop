In 2006, Jeff Oly Olson formed Retro Grave while still playing drums for the internationally acclaimed rock band Trouble. The debut, self-titled EP, was released on June 5, 2007 and was written, recorded, and performed in its entirety by Olson along side lyricist Paull Goodchild. The debut full-length, "Again," was released the following year as a download only (via the band's website) with guest musicians.
