Age of Storm was a doom/death metal group from Budweis (Czech Republic) formed in 1992. The members were: 

Patrik Bartuška - drums
Tomáš Dáòa - bass
Miloš Sokolík - guitar, vocals
Martin Lubinský - guitar

Although they played a very original and high-class music, they never earned international success.
During their activity they released two albums named Treshold of Pain [1997] and 13th Chamber [1999].   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Age+of+Storm">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
