This is freaky sheet.  Truly.  I feel kind of disturbed.  The records only a couple years old but it sounds like something fdrom the experimental 70s when FM radio was good and top 40 didnt' suck but heavier, meaner, and tougher.  The song structures make like no sense but wild musical crap is going on to sandwitched these differently sized lego blocks together.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zealous+Fuel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
