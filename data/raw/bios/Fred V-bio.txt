Fred V, real name Frederick Vahrman is a Drum & Bass producer hailing from the south-west of the UK. He was part of the duo Fred V & Grafix along with UK artist Grafix. Now exclusively signed to Hospital Records as a solo artist, he aspires to push the boundaries of the DnB landscape into new realms with his unique songwriting, vocal skills and as a supremely talented multi-instrumentalist.

With his shimmering big room steppers to heart-melting arpeggio melodies, Fred V draws inspiration from the likes of future-bass, electronica powerhouse Flume and the neo-soul stylings of Tom Misch. His accomplished songwriting abilities allow him to tread the delicate boundaries of DnB and the boundless realms of electronica.

Having spent the last seven years touring the world and receiving huge support across dancefloors and airwaves from the likes of Annie Mac, Friction, MistaJam and Rene LaVice, the decision to step away from his decade long collaborative project Fred V & Grafix marks a new and exciting chapter in Fred V’s career. 

Stepping up with an astounding collection of first-class sonics, Fred V’s highly anticipated debut solo album, ‘Radiate’ is on the horizon for the summer of 2021, on Hospital Records. Consisting of 15 tracks that feature exciting collaborations with Millbrook, Zara Kershaw, Vonné, Lottie Jones and SAYAH. Fred V’s first-ever standalone longplayer is everything you’d hope for and more, built from an infusion of electronic influences from the past, present and future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fred+V">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
