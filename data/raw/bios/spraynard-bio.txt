2008–2012, 2014–present

The self-proclaimed "demi gods of horror-core" known as Spraynard formed in 2008 with one intention in mind: to plant the ideological seeds of unrestrained patriotism in the minds of their listeners.

Guitarist Pat Graham was seen at rallies supporting the Iraq War as recently as January, 2010. "I'm not just here to support our military offensive in Iraq - I'm here to support every kind of military action imaginable, past, present, and future. I will not be satisfied until every last person in this world is pledging to my American flag. I have no apologies."

To propagate this message of extreme colonialism, Spraynard implements "subtle yet strong patriotic themes" in their songs and records. Graham explains, "if you actually take just two fucking minutes to think about our lyrics, you'll find that they're all about preserving the kind of America that the puritan settlers intended to create. And yes, that means I support the revival of actual witch hunts."

These intensely nationalist perspectives have caught up with the band in the form of physical confrontation. Outside of a show in Boston, MA, the band was assaulted by a small army of 242 anti-fascist skinheads. According to the band, if it weren't for Dos, they might have actually lost the fight.

Bassist Mark asserts that he is indifferent to his bandmates' political beliefs. Showcasing Spraynard's trademark sense of humor, Mark joked "as long as I get paid in smack, I am happy."

The band reunited in March 31, 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spraynard">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
