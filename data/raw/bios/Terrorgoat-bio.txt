Terrorgoat was a Finnish noise/dark ambient project that released several demos and eventually changed their name to Kaniba. The music consists primarily of manipulations of various unusual sound sources such as vacuum cleaners, kettles, electronic devices, as well as manipulated vocals and computer-generated sounds. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Terrorgoat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
