Sailing To Nowhere is an Italian melodic power metal band founded in 2013 by a group of young musicians with different musical influences, raging from power metal to hard rock, and a strong desire to mix the hardest guitar sounds with elaborate melodies and plenty of atmospheres. After having signed a deal with Bakerteam Records, Sailing To Nowhere entered Kick Recording Studio in Rome, Italy, to record their debut album, 'To The Unknown', with Matteo Gabbianelli (Kutso) and Marco Cinghio Mastrobuono (Hour Of Penance), with very special guest appearances by Terence Holler (Eldritch), Leonardo Porcheddu ( Kuprij, Macaluso), David Folchitto (Prophilax, StormLord) and Valentina De Iuliis (Belladonna). 'To The Unknown' will be available starting from October 16th, with the video of the soon to be announced first single to be released on September 16. A full European tour will follow the album release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sailing+To+Nowhere">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
