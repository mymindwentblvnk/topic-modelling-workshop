Beaten to Death was formed in 2011 by Martin Rygge, Tommy Hjelm (both normally heard handling guitar-duties in Oslo-based metal quartet Insense) and drummer Christian Svendsen (also the relentless drumming machine in Tsjuder, The Cumshots, Grimfist and Gothminister), with Mika Martinussen and vocalist Anders Bakke (the latter well-known in the metal community after years of fronting the mighty She Said Destroy) completing the line-up. 

On September 26th 2011 the band released their first album on Mas-Kina Recordings, consisting of 9 songs, 1 second of silence, and 18 min 36 sec of gritty but strangely catchy grindcore - all recorded 100 % live at the bands rehearsal room during one weekend (except the vocals which were recorded a few days later)

Machine gun drums, ferocious guitars, snarling bass and intense vocals is the foundation of the B2D-sound. Add hauntingly beautiful harmonies and a brutal groove, and what you have is an infectious collection of deadly grind you wonâ€™t be able to sit still to, no-matter what your taste in music happens to be!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beaten+to+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
