bEEdEEgEE is the performing alias of Brian DeGraw, an American artist, musician and producer who lives and works between the inner city and the Catskill region of New York state. Most commonly known in the music world for his work at the centre of Gang Gang Dance and their musical mastery, SUM/ONE is his debut record as a solo artist.

Written and recorded over the course of a year in his Woodstock studio, the W0RMB1N, SUM/ONE initially began life when Brian left New York City – his home for the past twelve years – for the clouds of Woodstock. Amidst the peace of this new environment, the audio sketches he worked on gradually evolved into a project that fuses familiar deep synth soundscapes with audacious pop moments. The nine tracks that comprise SUM/ONE also feature the vocal talents of Alexis Taylor (Hot Chip), Lovefoxxx (CSS), Lizzi Bougatsos (Gang Gang Dance) and Douglas Armour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/bEEdEEgEE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
