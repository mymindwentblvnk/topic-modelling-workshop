Imminent Psychosis began as a 5-piece Thrash/Death metal band from Adelaide. The band played their first gig in February 2003, and has played consistantly around Adelaide ever since. With over 35 gigs under their belt, and supporting some of Australias best metal acts, including Psycroptic, Alarum, Terrorust, Captain Cleanoff, Switchblade, Double Dragon, and Pathogen. Imminent Psychosis have toured interstate and are planning another in the very near future (watch out fuckers...)

The debut full-length self-titled album was launched in September 2004 and has since reached #1 on the Powersurge Top 10 metal charts, and was selected as Feature release of the week on 3D radio in October. The single Shoot to Bleed ranked 5th in Australia in the MusicOZ metal/hardcore section. Tracks have also featured on Australian Compilations, including Underearthed 3, and The Art of Shredding A Tribute to Dime. They have also made the finals of the dB Magazine readers awards for 2006 as Top Adelaide Metal Band. 

In 2007 the band has taken a new direction with the departure of their singer and Leo taking over as the main vocalist. The band has adopted a more thash influence and has just recently released their 2nd album, entitled "Ruthless".

In 2010, Leo moved to Sweden, and the band brought in Troy (Cauldron Black Ram) and Bundy to replace him.
