Tautumeitas is a Latvian folk/world music band formed in 2015. The band consists of six women vocalists and instrumentalists.  TAUTUMEITAS started with traditional singing and tried to echo the traditional chanters. The closer they got to songs, the closer the songs got to them, until it seemed natural to intertwine it with everything that they had heard and felt in this world as their own. Now they play folk songs using voices and temporally appealing instruments to involve in the sound their senses and notions of time and space..
