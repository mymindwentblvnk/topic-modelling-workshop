The Shiva Hypothesis (TSH) is a collective of musical deviants hailing from the Twente region in the Netherlands. TSH has been pursuing its own brand of dark and extreme metal with relentless fervour and mad perseverance. The first part of the band’s history mainly involving a search for the right expression and sound, with the occasional loud outburst in the form of some instrumental live gigs. With the addition of vocalist MvS, giving a voice to the band’s inherent philosophy, the band is now ready to spout its vision into the world.

TSH can be sonically categorized as a mix of black metal aesthetics, occasional aggressive outpourings in the vein of 90’s death/thrash metal and some strong atmospheric touches.The band strives for a mystic, gloomy, murky sound (with a slight hint of madness) to underline the main theme: destruction and creation. The band’s lyrics incorporate elements of comparative religion and mythology. Musically, TSH has drawn inspiration from the works of such bands as Behemoth, Emperor, Immortal, Death, Ved Buens Ende, Mayhem, <CODE> and Gorgoroth, as well as numerous non-metal artists.

The release of a full length album is planned and at the same time work on an EP is already in progress; written, recorded and produced in accordance with the band’s strong DIY ethos. 

The Shiva Hypothesis are:
ML (bass, keys, additional vocals, songwriting),
JB (guitar, songwriting),
BN (drums),
MvS (vocals, lyrics)
