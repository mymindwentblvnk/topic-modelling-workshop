Immense is an avant-garde post-rock band from Bristol.  Their sound brings together both traditional rock band instruments as well as sounds from electronic equipment and live orchestral samples. The band's second album Hidden Between Sleeves features the vocalist Rocky Votolato.  Unlike so many bands Immense don't try to fit into the pigeon-hole of "alternative" music but create truly original music.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Immense">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
