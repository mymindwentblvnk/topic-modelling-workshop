Another spelling of Extacy. The Estasy self-titled record is released on Ikuisuus label in september 2008.

"Black velvet mask, golden wigs, untied shoes, candle flames & beautiful trickling of wax, vine leaves, powder puffs. Mystery is the word. All tracks recorded in darkness. It's about spiritual evol love emotion....it's not the pills...oh oh whatever" - Emi Estasy
