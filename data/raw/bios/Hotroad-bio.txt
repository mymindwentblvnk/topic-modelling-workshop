Hotroad is a Swiss metal born in 2007 by  Thierry Coowar (Vocals & Guitare Rythmique), Loïc Tapia (Guitare Lead), Florian Grobéty (Basse) et Théophile Burnat (Batterie). The group was founded following the breakdown of their previous band.

 In 2008, Hotroad recorded his first CD EP “The Hottest Road” followed by their second EP in 2009 “Twisted Head For Metal Bang”.

After a few gigs, the band decides to go further and making their debut album. Hosted by the MSJ recording studio, they recorded 7 tracks, mixed by Christophe Hurni and mastered in Basel by Glenn Miller in the Greenwood Studio. 

Hotroad never stop going ahead and moving up the Metal scene and promotion. After releasing their debut album in late October 2010, the band signed with two agencies, M&O Office for the promotion (November 2010) and Insano Booking agency (March 2011).
