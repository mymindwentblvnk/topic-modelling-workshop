A horde THUNDERKRAFT was formed in 2001 by Alafern. The first line up was ALAFERN - guitar, AMORTH - drums, SIGURD - guitar, ARTURIUS - bass, DUCHE - vocal, OLGA - keyboard. After a few rehearsals Arturius left the band, and guitarist Sigurd switched to a bass. Helg (Runes of Dianceht, Khors) joined the formation as a guitarist for a few months. THUNDERKRAFT played several fests in Kharkov. The same year, Ann joined as a second keyboard player. Soon Olga left the band. In December 2002 THUNDERKRAFT participated in a fest " KOLOVOROT" in Kharkov and got very good responses from organizers of the fest and a crowd. After that, the horde began recording a debut album, but soon the project was hibernated for a year and only in 2004 THUNDERKRAFT came back. In February 2005 THUNDERKRAFT continued recording the album at a studio Audioalchimia (earlier Beat studio, Kharkiv). THUNDERKRAFT line-up was: AMORTH - drums, vocal, ALAFERN - guitars, violin, SIGURD - bass, ANN - keyboard, flute. The title of a new record was "A Flag of Victory ", with seven tracks: 01. The Sun in the Breast, 02. Masquerade for the Blind Ones / Prison of Souls, 03. The North Inside, 04. Mors Triumphalis, 05. Mattery of Chaos, 06. Greatness and Might, 07. The Might of the Thunder. In May, the horde played in Sevastopol and Simferopol to support the new coming album. In August the band got a deal with a Dutch label "Blazing Productions" to release the first album. The record was supposed to be out in winter of 2006, but due to hard work of the label it was released on November 7th of 2005 earlier than announced. In the beginning of September the drummer Amorth left the band, to take full time in another project. Currently members are in search of a new drummer and in preparation for recording a new album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thunderkraft">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
