Biography:

Repaid In Blood is a California metal band, whose roots are firmly planted in death metal and metalcore. Taking the best of both subgenres, Repaid In Blood blend crushing riffs, searing solos, ball-shattering breakdowns, and melodic interludes that linger in the mind and humming later.

Repaid In Blood is a metal band that started in 2006, from the Bay Area Ca. The name was taken from a lyric off The Black Dahlia Murder's first full-length album, Unhallowed. The name is an expression of violence in its purest form, vengeance. Victor Hernandez and Jake Burrman formed the band in high school. They soon found another founding member in Rich Sharman, who began on guitar, but later switched to bass. Years later; Repaid In Blood rounded out the current lineup with Juan Galvez on drums, and Mike Knittel on lead guitar. Repaid In Blood are serious about the music they create, but always have fun in doing so. Whether it is about kidâ€™s cereal, zombies, comic books, Game Of Thrones or peeing on you, you are guaranteed to take something away from Repaid In Blood.

Repaid In Blood has worked the local scene with a strong fan base, played in three showcases at South By Southwest in 2013, a West Coast Tour with Weapon Status Red, as well as a holiday parody music video I Saw Zombies Eating Santa Claus. Repaid In Blood is in the studio finishing their first full-length album Born In A Lazarus Pit with Eric Hill at The Blue Room Recording Studios, which will be released in June 2014. The band has plans of doing a US Tour with Apothesary this summer to promote the album.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Repaid+In+Blood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
