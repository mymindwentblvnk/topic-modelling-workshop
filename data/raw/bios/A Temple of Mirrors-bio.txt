We are a Horror Metal/ Doom Pop band originally from Monterey CA. We have released two full length albums "Fistful Of Guns", and "Human (e)rase." and are currently recording our newest installation "Translucent" due sometime mid 2010. We typically talk about Conspiracy, New World Order, Secret Societies, and of course Zombies. This band is a way for us to not only express ourselves but to fight for our beliefs and protest our adversaries. We are always looking for other artists to collaborate with, so hit us up to record, do shows, whatever! At the moment we are trying to find a bassist and a drummer for live shows in the Chico CA. area! Message us if you are in our local vicinity and would like to try out. Must be 21 or older, have talent, equipment, job, and be able to tolorate the undead! For any other issues untouched here, drop us a message <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Temple+of+Mirrors">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
