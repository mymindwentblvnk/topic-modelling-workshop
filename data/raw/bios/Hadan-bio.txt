The power-grind-thrash quartet that is known as HADAN was formed in San Francisco, California in the spring of 2000. Comprised of Jason Lee Homran (bass / backing vocals), Mark Kazorowski (guitar / 2002), Antoine Reuben-Diavola (drums / 2002), and Johnny Helvete (vocals / 2007) - HADAN has shared the stage with both underground and international Metal heavyweights from across the U.S. including All Shall Perish, Ludicra, Watch Them Die, Origin, Incantation, Sadus, and Cannibal Corpse. Currently HADAN continues to evolve it's genre bending sound, as they dive deeper into Metal's subconscious layer of resonance.
