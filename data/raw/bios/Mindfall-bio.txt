Mindfall is a heavy metal band founded in 2014, which consists of five musicians from the City of Oulu, Northern Finland. Even though the band is young, its members have many years of experience in a number of bands playing music from different genres. The band members are defined by participation in the song writing process and the desire to provide an intensive gig experience to the audience. Mindfall ́s music is masterfully composed and arranged, not forgetting the melodies. The lyrics take a stand on today ́s phenomenon and sometimes sail with heavier waters.
Despite its young age Mindfall has played many gigs and is already known as an immersive live performer. The band has just completed their first release, the Post- Apocalyptic Grind EP.
