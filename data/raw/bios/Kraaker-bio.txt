Kraaker was formed on the mighty Hardangervidda, Norway, a winters night in 2006 by Gregorius Grim Knockelkatt(bass and vocals) and Skrangelfant(guitars). In the months following, 7 songs were spawned out of the duo's collaboration. Recorded in the cold months 2007/2008,  the songs can now be heard on the 2010 debut album "Musikk fra Vettenes Dom", released on the Italian label FinalEarthbeatProd.
