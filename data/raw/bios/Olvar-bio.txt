The word Olvar means the ancient trees that grow in Arda. The themes of this band are of the forest, nature and darkness as well as some apparent Tolkien influences. This solely a studio band and as far as we know we can see no live shows taking place in the near future but who knows what the future may hold. Some could say that the music we play is Metal/Black Metal but we dont like to confine ourselves to any music genre. Olvar is an attempt to take our own direction in music and we write it for our own enjoyment. Each song will sound somewhat different in the way it was written and the way it was produced. Since we are not in a studio recording every song at once every song will have a different feeling and message. Unlike most metal Olvar is not music to bang your head to but rather to imagine yourself alone in the woods with nothing but yourself and the elements of nature. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Olvar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
