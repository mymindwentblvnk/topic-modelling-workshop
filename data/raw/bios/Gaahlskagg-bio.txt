Gaahlskagg is a project which was founded out of the band Sigfader in the year 1998,
since both Gaahl and Skagg wanted to create more extreme, more mocking music... with few (if any) limitations.

They first released the Split CD: "Erotic Funeral Party I" together with Stormfront in 1999,
then in 2000 they released their first full-length: "Erotic 
Funeral", which was recorded in Grieghallen studios during 666I.
Currently the work for their second full-length album: "Av Norrønt 
Blod" is still in progress but suffers a huge delay due to the fact that both Gaahl and Skagg have other more important projects.
For this upcoming release Høst (of Taake) will do some guest vocals.

Due to some reasons, the label No Colours Records re-released Erotic Funeral without checking back with the band in late '08 as one 12" LP  (available limited to 100 pieces in blue vinyl and as regular black vinyl) instead of the previously announced pair of three 7" EP's.
This release should therefore be considered a bootleg!
There is also a typo on the LP which says that Thurzur (instead of Mutt) did the drums for "EF" 

The line up for "Erotic Funeral" was:
Gaahl - vox
Skagg - guitars
Tormentor - bass
Mutt - drums

The line up for "A.N.B." is:
Gaahl - vox
Skagg - guitars / bass
Thurzur - drums
Høst - guest vocals
