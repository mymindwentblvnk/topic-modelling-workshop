Bergraven turns the traditional blast-and-flay aesthetic of "frost bitten grimness" on its ear and comes at you with sweeping riff dirges, winding cinematic passages, melodic guitar interludes, tortured-yet-vaguely authoritarian and Germanic vocal overtones and ambient pedal steel excursions. Formed in 2002 by the single member of Bergraven, PÃ¤r Gustafsson. The discography so far has consisted of two demos, two full-length albums, and a third LP is planned for release in 2009 on Hydra Head Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bergraven">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
