Pete started playing and recording music in the late 1980's, influenced by the punk rock/hardcore scene of the time. Through the years Pete played, recorded, and toured with many bands including Hardware, Buried, and Ten Boy Summer. In 2004 Pete started podcasting, and eventually started recording music again in 2007. Much of his work is released under a Creative Commons license. (If you need a different license, please contact Pete.) For two years now Pete has taken part in the RPM Challenge, to record an entire album in one month. The RPM Challenge happens each February, so expect a new album from Pete some time in March...
