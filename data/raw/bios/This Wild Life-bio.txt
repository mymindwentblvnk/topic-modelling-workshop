This Wild Life is a two piece acoustic band comprised of two drummers, what the hell right? We met in our early 20’s and realized that although we were raised on opposite ends of the country, our musical journeys were strikingly similar. Like many teenagers, we listened to a variety of music ranging from blink-182 and Dashboard Confessional to Earth, Wind & Fire and Snoop Dogg.

Fast forward about a decade and I met Anthony working at a Guitar Store. We started a band together. For about six months we tried out singers to no avail until one day Anthony told me to suck it up and just sing for the damn band already. We grinded as a local band for years and although we managed to pack out our local venue, the music industry never caught onto us. After our last show, Anthony sold his drum set and told me he wanted to just play acoustic stuff from now on. So we charged our credit cards and flew across the country to make a full length record. That record is called Clouded (Deluxe Edition) and it changed our lives. 2016 comes around and we get back into the studio with a batch of songs totally unlike our first record. That record is called Low Tides.

And so here we are today. Our producer Ryan Hadlock (The Lumineers, Vance Joy) helped us explore unique instrumentation. I hate it when bands tell you their new record is their “best shit yet” or “more mature”. That’s not for them to decide, it’s for the listener. And so I leave you with our record Petaluma. It’s our best shit yet
