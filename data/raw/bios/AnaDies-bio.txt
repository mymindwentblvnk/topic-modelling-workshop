AnaDies blends the diverse musical backgrounds of its members to create a unique, appealing sound featuring lush melodies and punishing aggression. Since AnaDies was formed in early 2003, they have drawn influence from artists such as Lacuna Coil, Katatonia, Opeth, and A Perfect Circle to create a sound that has been described as dynamically riveting and emotionally hypnotic. Regretfully they have parted ways as of April 1. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/AnaDies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
