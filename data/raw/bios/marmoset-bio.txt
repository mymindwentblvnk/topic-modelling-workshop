Crafting a shambling, uniquely Midwestern take on British post-punk and psychedelic pop sounds, Indianapolis' Marmoset began playing in the '90s with the lineup of bassist/vocalist Jorma Whittaker, guitarist LonPaul Ellrich, guitarist/vocalist David Jablonski, and drummer Jason Cavan.

After signing with Secretly Canadian, they released the 1998 debut EP Hiddenforbidden, which featured an abrasive yet catchy sound and songs that barely passed the two-minute mark. Their sprawling debut album, Today It's You, arrived early the following year and broadened the band's sound (even though the length of their songs stayed as short as ever). In 2001, the band returned with Record in Red, a darker, trippier set of songs; the following year's Mishawaka EP featured cleaner production, more abstract soundwriting, and more detailed arrangements. Marmoset went on hiatus for a few years, during which time Whittaker released a self-titled solo album in 2003.

The band resurfaced, minus Ellrich, on the 2006 Indiana indie rock compilation Delicious Berries and contributed a cover of Jens Lekman's "Sky Phenomenon" to Secretly Canadian's SC100 collection in 2007. Florist Fired, which recalled Today It's You's freewheeling art pop, arrived later that year. Whittaker and company moved to Joyful Noise Recordings for Tea Tornado, released in August 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Marmoset">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
