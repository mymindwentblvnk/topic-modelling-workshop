In the year 2004 Satanachia Agliareth was formed by Cazador in the bass(Rip), Diabolica in the drums (Rip) and Moloch in the vocals/guitar. Firstly a demo was recorded with 2 tracks, afterwards 3 more tracks were added giving as a result the debut demo called BAFOMET edited under the german label Sodomistic Rituals Productions and the unconditional support of Shabatu & Ventriz Grimorium (Grima Morstua). This demo was spread as a plague in different countries and continents having as a result very good reviews. More ahead by obscure reasons Diabolica (rip) leaves the band, being replaced by a band..s close friend called Carlos “El Villa” Villalba who supported the horde for a while now... The continous changes in the band..s kept on untill the formation got complete of Satanachia Agliareth with Morbo (drums), Necro Profanador (bass) and Moloch (guitars /vocals) with which they returned to desecrate the forgotten Argentinian scene! {}
