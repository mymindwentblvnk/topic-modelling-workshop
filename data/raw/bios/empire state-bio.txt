The eclectic electronic/post-rock group Empire State consists of brothers Jay and Tim Nackashi and a revolving cast of members, including Alex McManus, Brent Jones and Jessi Flavin. Their self-titled debut album, which was released in early 2001, introduced their unique mix of sampled sounds, homemade inventions, and conventional instruments. ~ Heather Phares, All Music Guide <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Empire+State">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
