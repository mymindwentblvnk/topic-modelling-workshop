So Be It
Hometown: Boston, MA USA

So Be It were a brutal hardcore band featuring Joe Shumsky of R'N'R.

So Be It brought to mind the early years of hardcore legends Integrity, Ringworm, and even Damnation AD. Fusing a bare bones metallic heaviness with a sense of hardcore and punk energy. No solos, no commercial accessibility, just brutal, hate filled hardcore, that was the soundtrack to trend killers worldwide.

So Be It "The Wrath Of The Skies" 7"EP was released on Deathwish in 2005.

After the release So Be It played regionally for a brief time before finally disbanding. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/So+Be+It">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
