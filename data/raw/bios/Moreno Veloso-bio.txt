Moreno Veloso is a Brazilian musician and singer born on November 22, 1972 in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. He is one of the sons of the Brazilian singer Caetano Veloso and his first wife Gadelha (Dedé) Veloso.

Brazilian singer Gal Costa, another pillar of Brazilian popular music, is Moreno Veloso's godmother. Additionally, many of the greats of the Brazilian music scene visited the Veloso household frequently and, therefore, Moreno Veloso grew up surrounded by musicians and much music. This rich environment had a great impact in Moreno Veloso's musical development.

Veloso studied physics at a university but turned instead to musici and singing. In 2000 Moreno Veloso recorded his first album, Máquina de Escrever Música (English: Music Typewriter) but his songwriting debut was much earlier in 1982 with Um Canto de Afoxé para o Bloco Do Ile, a clear reference to African mythology. The Afro-Brazilian religion of Candomblé, full of rithms and colors, predominant in his native city of São Salvador da Bahia must have had a remarcable impact on his natural talent while he was growing up.

Moreno Veloso's work has been well received far and wide. For example, American singer and band leader Chrissie Hynde, a longtime resident of the city of London, England, has expressed great admiration for his work and even has traveled and performed with him throughout Brazil right after the turn of the millennium. One of Moreno Veloso's music groups was called Moreno Veloso + 2 (composed of Moreno Veloso, Alexandre Kassin and Domênico Lancelotti). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moreno+Veloso">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
