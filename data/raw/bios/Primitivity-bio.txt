PRIMITIVITY is a cello and percussion ensemble from Washington DC that blends elements of classical and heavy metal music into a new genre called cello rock. Cellist Loren Westbrook-Fritts composes the music and provides the leads, while cellists David Teie of the National Symphony, Kristin Ostling of the Baltimore Symphony, and Mauricio Betanzo of the Maryland Symphony all shred out intense riffs and harmonies. Percussionist Robby Burns from the University of Maryland completes the band with rumbling drum hits. Specializing in the music of Megadeth, Apocalyptica, and Metallica, Primitivity also performs its own original compositions in an undeniably unique concert program. As Primitivity blends refined classical approaches and the new sounds of heavy metal, it ensures that rock cello thrives forever. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Primitivity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
