Putrefied was formed by Edwin (guitars, ex-Gutwrench, ex-Pentacle) and Toep (drums, from Consolation) at the end of 1998. Both had the urge to create midpaced, downtuned and sick Death Metal, in the vein of several US-Death Metal bands. 

At the beginning they played under the name of "Skulldusk", but decided to change that name after they quit with their first bassplayer. They started to place some adds for both a bassplayer and a vocalist.
After a few auditions, Marcel joined as a vocalist, shortly followed by Pascal on bass. This all happened in the winter of 1999, when Putrefied as a band became a fact. 

Edwin and Toep had already composed eight tracks, so they were ready to do gigs from the very start. In October 2000 was the departure of bassplayer Pascal. Luckily a replacement was found soon, in the person of Rein, who'd also played with several other Death Metal bands. In the end of December they released their first demo called "bodybits".

In July 2001 Edwin left the band because of a move to Germany, so again the other Putrefied members had to look for a new guitar player. In august they found a new guitar player in the person of Michael Blokker. Michael played for many years in a local (Den Helder) death metal band called Rottus In Extremis. After a month of rehearsals the first gig with Michael at MOLFEST was a fact. 

In the following years Putrefied released a full-length album called "The Putrid Remains" and a live album called "Live, Plugged and Crushing".  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Putrefied">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
