5. Noid is a project based out of Brazil that plays a super 90's amalgam of alternative rock, grunge, noise, and post-hardcore. Think Alice In Chains mixed with Bleach-era Nirvana and Helmet. Chunky riffs, rumbling bass, and psychodelic guitars join with Staley-esque vocals for an experience that takes me back to the golden years of MTV and alternative radio." metaltrenches.com

O Noid é uma banda de Curitiba que toca um amálgama dos anos 90 e 2000 de rock alternativo, grunge, ruído e pós-hardcore. Pense em Alice In Chains misturada com o Nirvana e Helmet. Riffs robustos se juntam aos vocais psicodélicos para uma experiência que te leva de volta aos anos dourados da MTV e do rádio alternativo.
