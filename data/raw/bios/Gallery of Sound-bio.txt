The Style of Gallery of Sound could be described as symphonic, progressive, melodic or power metal, however, the way those five musicians are going is new and certainly distinguishes form other bands. In the beginning of 2003 GOS won the Austrian Newcomer Award. In the summer of 2004 the five musicians worked on their first album and released Hegemony in November of 2004. It shows their great musical variety and the many different musical influences that they are able to combine into hard and powerful Heavy Metal. Throughout their constant live commitment in whole Austria and many other states they can count on a steadily growing fan community.
