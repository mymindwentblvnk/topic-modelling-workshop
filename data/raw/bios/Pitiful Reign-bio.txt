Pitiful Reign started out in mid/late 2003 under the name of Metalegion, originally as a three piece, made up of three friends from school. After the inclusion of Matt Walker on bass, Tom Britton joined the band on lead guitar, leaving Josh to concentrate on rhythm guitar and his role as vocalist. 

The following two years saw the band honing their talents, both live on stage and in the studio, releasing 24 Litre Killer (2005) and Toxic Choke( 2006) This was also the year that Pitiful Reign played their most prestigious live show to date, at Bloodstock Open Air, alongside Edguy, Metal Church and Stratavarious; as well as being voted 3rd best UK unsigned band in Terrorizer magazine. 

Early 2007 saw Pitiful Reign part ways with Tom Britton, and reform the line up, with the inclusion of Alan Pashby and Nev Britton on guitars, bringing to the band a fresh burst of energy and new ideas. 

The new established line-up quickly made it’s mark with the recording of the explosive new 4-track CD "D.I.V.E" which was voted Demo of the Month in Metal Hammer magazine. The release coincided with the announcement that the band had been signed to Italian metal label Punishment 18. 

Writing is now completed for the album, entitled “Visual Violence” which is expected to be released in Early 2008; with production duties being taken up by Steve DiGiorgio ( Sadus, ex-Death, ex-Testament, ex-Iced Earth) and Juan Urteaga (Vile, who produced Exodus, Testament and Sadus amongst many others) and with artwork by Ed Repka (Megadeth, Municipal Waste). 

The release of “Visual Violence” will see Pitiful Reign poised to bring their beer-fuelled thrash mayhem to the rest of the world
