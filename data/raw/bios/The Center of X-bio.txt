"Living Free Again" from The Center of X is the first release from Chris Eliot and Dave Hall who have had extensive Studio and Live experience together since 1990. This CD contains material written about current events such as the recent Southern California fires in 2007, as well as the U.S. troops serving their country, and waiting to come home. There is also "Deep Water" about the devastating Tsunami in the Eastern Pacific. Some songs have an epic theme and are more dramatic and fictional. Strong vocals and melodies are present throughout and powerful drums set the groove for a solid release from the Center of X. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/THE+CENTER+OF+X">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
