Richmond, VA's Rah Bras got together a long time ago. They traveled all over the world, performing countless concerts of their fabulous, insane music.

They made many fantastic recordings, culminating in 2005's blindingly brilliant WHOHM album.

Rah Bras disbanded in February of 2007. With them, many tiny pieces of many hearts passed as well. 

Those who deign to struggle through 30 more years on this planet will be rewarded with the opportunity to catch the Rah Bras 2037 reunion.
