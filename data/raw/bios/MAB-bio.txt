Mab was born in Sardinia (Italy) on a very stormy winter night from Alice Dionis (vocals and guitars) and Jessica Dionis (drums).

After a few years of activity in Italy they decided to move to London, U.K. which has remained their workbase ever since.

Their music is a wicked mixture of alternative rock, metal, grunge with an hint of american punk: this comes from a strong influence from their peaceful homeland and the acid necrosis of a neurotic London.
Dream meets reality. They call it New Dark.

In London they played all the small venues for a start but soon enough they hit big stages such as Mean Fiddler, Koko, The Marquee, The Borderline, Islington Academy and finally the first very big support: they opened for HIM at The HAMMERSMITH APOLLO in 2004. Immediately after they hit the road on their first UK tour with BREED 77.
All this without having a record deal or an Album recorded yet!!!

In 2006 they took part to the Album “UNUSUAL”, a Tribute to GIUNI RUSSO (Italian Singer and Artist) where they re-arranged and performed one of her big hits from the 80s: “ADRENALINA”, invited by Italian producer M.Antonietta SISINI.

They also started a music collaboration with another Italian Icon of the experimental music, FRANCO BATTIATO.
They took part to his Album “IL VUOTO” singing 3 songs recorded at the Olympic Studios in London: “Il Vuoto”, “The Game is Over” and a song for his movie "NIENTE E' COME SEMBRA" (2007) which also sees them as walk-on actresses.

Together with F.Battiato they played as special guest at the "SANREMO's FESTIVAL” in 2007 (the greatest Italian Music event broadcasted worldwide) followed by many other TV performances such as "DOMENICA IN" and "CHE TEMPO CHE FA". They also accompanied F.Battiato on his Summer and Winter Tour around the most beautiful theatres in Italy and Spain (2007/08).

MAB played the TRAFFIC FESTIVAL of TORINO in 2007 both with F. BATTIATO and SUBSONICA, LA NOTTE BIANCA in Rome, the HEINEKEN JAMMING FESTIVAL in 2008 opening for MARLENE KUNTZ and VASCO ROSSI and invited by KASBA COMMUNICATION played a very special gig in honour of film Icon DAVID LYNCH after his conference about Transcendental Meditation that took place in Palermo in 2007.

MAB had also the privilege of sharing the stage with LENE and LESTER LOVICH, professor MANLIO SGALAMBRO, VERDENA, KATASTROPHY WIFE , IL NUOVO QUARTETTO ITALIANO, ROBERTO CACCIAPAGLIA, CATHEDRAL and ESOTERICA.

MAB first ALBUM "DECAY" was released in November 2007 by UNIVERSAL MUSIC (Italy) and Casket Records (UK).

After a line-up change in 2008, Alice and Jessica started working on their own.

Their new Album ILLUSION is now scheduled to come out on the 24th of November 2011.
