Formed in Late 2010, Transcending The Flesh set out with the single aim of making heavy music. With the release of their debut EP "Eternal Suffering" the band started to make a name for themselves gaining support slots on high profile local shows with bands such as Chimaira, Ingested, Thy Art Is Murder and Acrania. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Transcending+The+Flesh">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
