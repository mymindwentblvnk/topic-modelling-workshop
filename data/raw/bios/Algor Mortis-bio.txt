There are three bands with the name Algor Mortis.

(1)Algor Mortis from Australia, which performs a style of death metal/deathcore.

(2)Algor Mortis from Hungary, which performs a style of Modern Metal.

(3)Algor Mortis from Germany, which performs a style of Atmospheric Black Metal.

(2)Algor Mortis hails from Budapest, founded during the autumn of 2000. Following years of lackluster setbacks a lineup finally crystallized in 2004, which to this day carries the banner.

The crew are: Endre Alfeldi – drums, Gábor Kígyóssy – guitar, Bálint Üveges – bass and Gergő Rácz – vocals/guitar.

The recordings include two thankfully forgotten demos, "The Craft of Agony" in 2001 and "New Age Rupture" in 2004. The band had to wait until the summer of 2006 to release a disc that met their expectations, both musically as well as production-wise. The three-song promo entitled "Circle of Fire" is meant to reflect the diverse flavors added to the music, and has received excellent reviews from Hungarian metal magazines and webzines.

Musically, the style of Algor Mortis arches a large scope of influences, ranging from in-your-face modern metal to subtleties that typically have a folkish edge.

For the time being the band is writing songs for the next release set to be recorded sometime within the year, after which extensive promotion is planned through live gigs and festivals.
