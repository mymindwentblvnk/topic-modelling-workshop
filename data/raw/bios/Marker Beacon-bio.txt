Marker Beacon is a french heavy metal band

Marker Beacon is a heavy thrash metal band created in 2000, composed of Bruno Creuzet (guitar and vocals), Miguel Diaz (drums), Olivier Matz (guitar) and Jérôme Thiébaut (bass guitar). After many concerts between 2004 and 2007 in Paris (La Maroquinerie, Le New Morning, Le Gibus, …) and a demo in 2006, the band crosses a quiet period. The band meets again in 2011 to record a new album. Marker Beacon becomes a non-profit association in 2012. After two years of recording, in 2013, the album is available in audio-CD format and is freely downloadable from the website (released under Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0).
