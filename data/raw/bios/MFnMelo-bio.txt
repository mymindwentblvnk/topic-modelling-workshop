MFnMelo (real name: Logan Yutters) is a Chicago rapper, part of the Pivot Gang collective of artists.

Pivot Gang’s resident beast, MFnMelo brings an edge and rough energy to Pivot’s music with a vocal style reminiscent of Action Bronson. Melo perfectly balances the sonic components created by Saba’s optimism and Joseph Chilliams’ self-aware humor. As of yet, MFnMelo has the smallest discography out of Pivot Gang’s crew but makes up for it with a big stage presence.

MFnMelo grew up on the Westside of Chicago before moving to Maywood when he was 12. MFnMelo gradually got into rap, beginning with Nelly and then moving on to Juvenile and Lil Wayne. But then everything changed when Joseph Chilliams put him on to Eminem during his junior year of high school. Melo originally met Chilliams and Saba through MySpace when he took the two brothers up on an invitation to record with them one day in their basement. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MFnMelo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
