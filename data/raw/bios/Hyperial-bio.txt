Hyperial is Polish band who came into being in 2006. The music of this band may be described as an eclectic death metal, thanks to combining different music styles. Hyperial's compositions contain a lot of dark, futuristic keyboard parts, which set an exceptional tone for the sound.

In 2007 Hyperial has recorded new, 2- tracked, homemade demo titled "The eternal paradise of the illusion". After this recording the band concluded, that it was high time they had recorded something more professional, what could be presented to the general public.

At this time Hyperial had the honour of sharing the scene with some great Polish bands as a: Trauma, Kat, Christ Agony or Blindead.

At the beginning of November 2009 Hyperial signed the contract with underground Polish label- Psycho Records, which is robustly growing strong. This cooperation has effected with debut album "Sceptical Vision", released in January 2010, which got high notes in magazines and music websites.

In 2010 new drummer, Koziol joined the band, with who Hyperial has played so far few successful gigs. Currently Hyperial is planning to record new album and the production will be released in MCD.
