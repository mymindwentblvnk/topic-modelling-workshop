Ilemauzar started in 1996 as a black metal band and played extensively in the underground gigs in Singapore and Malaysia. A demo titled, Pit of Despair was recorded in 1997 with 3 tracks strongly influence from the Greek style of metal in the veins of Rotting Christ and Varathron. The 1998 demo release scored a full length record deal with then kvlt label, Dark Artz Releases (Singapore). 
A full length was recorded in 1999 titled, Ancestral Shadows, but was never released due to the closure of the recording studio. 
The band split in 2000 and went into a hiatus for 13 years. Upon reforming the band, Ilemauzar was offered a slot for Rock in Solo 2013 New World Propaganda which happened on 3rd of November 2013. At that time, Maelstrom from Australia also filled in the duty as Ilemauzar's drummer and has been with the band since then. 
Ilemauzar is currently signed to Sepsis Records in Indonesia and looking forward to performing in other parts of Asia in the upcoming Asia tour. 
Ilemauzar has signed to Transcending Obscurity on Oct 2016 for their next album to be released somewhere between end of 2017 to mid 2018 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ilemauzar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
