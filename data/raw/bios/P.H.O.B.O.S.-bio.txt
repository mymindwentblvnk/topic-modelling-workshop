Formed in early 2000, P.H.O.B.O.S. is the brainchild of Frederic Sacri. Initially founded as a four-piece, Sacri has directed this band of musical mechanics, meticulously recording and molding material and a sound unlike many of their peers. Entering Red Studio in 2004 with producer Olivier Anicaux, Tectonics immediately finds a band already highly evolved and one that, alongside countrymen (and labelmates) Blut Aus Nord and Overmars, are pioneering a new lineage for metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/P.H.O.B.O.S.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
