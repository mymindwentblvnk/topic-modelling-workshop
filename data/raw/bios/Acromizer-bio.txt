Acromizer was born in September 2008 following the split of the band Oscuro Teatro. Edu (Alyanza) and Oriol (Riot of Violence) contacted Imanol (Empanadilla de Pus) and changed their style to the Bay Area Thrash Metal. The first bassists of the band were Dani and Manolo until Pol entered as a consolidated bass player.

The recording of the first demo "The Other Side", with four songs, represented the prelude to the recording in June 2015 of the first album called "Spreading the Plague", recorded at the Moontower Studios and mastered at Unisound Studios by the prestigious Dan Swanö.

After the album recording and its presentation in several venues, the formation receives the additions of Mikel on the guitar, Xavi on bass guitar and Alfons (Alyanza) on the drums.

In March 2019, Acromizer enters the studio to record their second album, called "Awakening", again at Moontower Studios, an album that shows new songs that consolidate the band's characteristic sound, speed and power with a well-defined melody.
