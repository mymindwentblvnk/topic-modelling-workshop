GOTMA's music can be described as melting pot, in which you throw the classic thrash and the modern, slightly more groove oriented metal. Altogether, it creates a sound that hits you like a hammer in the face, mixing speedy thrash-rhythms with big grooving choruses and seamless tempochanges. Add to that thoughtful lyrics and you have a winner, in GOTMA. 

The band started out in January 2006 when two friends at Karlstad University, Markus and Petter decided to start a band. Both being guitarists, they started jamming and a musical bond soon formed. Most of early 2006 was spent searching for musicians to fill up the remaining positions in the band, and many a hopeful was rejected due to various circumstances. 
After a few months of searching, it all started taking shape. Sometime in the spring of '06, friend and also neighbour Sebastian took up the microphone, and awhile later Erik was talked into the band during another drinking session at the local pub. Later in the fall of '06 bassplayer Fredrik joined the band. 

In February/March, Erik stepped out, simply because he felt that he did not have time. After a brief period of trying out drummers, GOTMA settled on Jolene, who joined the band in April.
