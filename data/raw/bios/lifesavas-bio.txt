A hip hop duo from Portland, Oregon, Lifesavas are notable for what The Onion's Nathan Rabin called their "self deprecating style." Their creative and insightful songs are both approachable and complex.  The group consists of Jumbo the Garbageman and Vursatyl.

Like many of their peers on Quannum Projects, their lyrics tend to be rhythmically intricate and emotionally introspective, though it contains little of the self-lacerating qualities found on the inhabitants of underground hip hop labels like Anticon and Lex. Instead, they take a more positive approach, especially noticeable in songs like "Livin' Time". They take a dim view toward the prevailing "gangsta" trends and what they view as the dumbed-down and immoral tendencies of mainstream American rap. Other topics covered on their debut album Spirit in Stone include politics, relationships, religion and racial progress.

The group has just released their second album, "Gutterfly", which features Smif n Wessun, Dead Prez, Camp Lo, and George Clinton, among others. They tour frequently with labelmates and partners Blackalicious. They have collaborated with several notable artists, including Vernon Reid of Living Colour, Fishbone, J-Live, Lyrics Born, Gift of Gab, DJ Shadow, and Dead Prez. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lifesavas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
