James Chadwick hails from a sleepy village on the Lincolnshire , Cambridgeshire border, he is an accomplished singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. 

Although comparisons have been made to many artists, such as Nick Drake, Jeff Buckley and Jimi Hendrix, James prefers to celebrate his own unique style which he says has been influenced by "everything and nothing" (but not forgetting Bob Dylan).

Finalist in 2005's BBC Radio 2 Young Folk Awards, playing to a full house at the Sage, Gateshead, and featured on Mike's Radio 2 folk programme in December 2005, James and other finalists were described by Mike Harding as "the cream of the UK's young acoustic folk and roots scene".
