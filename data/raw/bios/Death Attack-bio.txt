The German city of Wolfsburg in the middle of the 1980s: The only thing the city is known for is the VW-factory. There is a small Metal scene, and only one big band worth mentioning called STEELTOWER, which later became HEAVENS GATE. Ever since VENOM released “Welcome to Hell” in 1981 an increasing number of bands all over the world had appeared on the international scene, all wanting to play faster and harder Heavy Metal. In the German Ruhr area there were bands such as KREATOR and SODOM. Influenced by these bands, but also by American acts like SLAYER and EXODUS, André “Ace” Borawski (guitar), Michael Hasse (vocals), Peter Schulz (drums) and Peter Laske (bass) formed the first extreme Metal band in Wolfsburg in the autumn of 1985: DEATH ATTACK. Ace played bass in STEELTOWER at the time, and so DEATH ATTACK was able to use the STEELTOWER rehearsal place to put together some songs. Sadly the band broke up already in the spring/summer of 1986. Ace and Peter Schulz went on to form the Speed Metal band INZEST while Michael joined forces with Hansi Müller and Michael Schnabel to form PROTECTOR. Peter Laske later came to create a Speed/Thrash-band called HERITAGE. During their existence DEATH ATTACK managed to put together only two songs, both recorded under primitive conditions at the rehearsal place. This picture disc EP will let you hear the first efforts by a band hailing from the Wolfsburg region to play really hard and extreme Metal. And still to this day ”Warrior’s Of Death” and the eponymous “Death Attack” is sure to give all fans of the early PROTECTOR stuff their fill of Teutonic Thrash! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Attack">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
