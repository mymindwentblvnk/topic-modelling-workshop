They were a few releases on download and on their website in 2009 it was announced the New Album available as Download would be released to cd! However this hasn't happened and their hasn't been any recent news or information on the bands future.

The band are certainly on a hiatus if not disbanded! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abigail%27s+Mercy">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
