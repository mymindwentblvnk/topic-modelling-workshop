GRAACE, Hailing from Sydney, Australia, burst onto the local music scene in October 2017, having gained attention from co-writing and singing on the track ‘Numb’ by musician Hayden James. Following the success of this infectious single, GRAACE began to delve deeper into the musical process by heading out on tour with Flight Facilities. Traveling across the world provided GRAACE with a deeper understanding of herself and her music, and she sat down to create songs for her 2018 EP ‘SOS’ once she returned home to Australia. The EP featured smash hits including, ‘Kissing Boys’ and ‘Last Night’, two tracks that helped GRAACE earn over 68 million streams on Spotify.

Leading up the release of her new EP in 2019, GRAACE has released two melancholic pop singles titled ‘Have Fun at Your Party’ and ‘21st Century Love’. The lyrics in both songs are raw and honest, and they provide listeners with an inside look into GRAACE’s life as a songwriter and as an individual. Connecting with her fan base is important to GRAACE, and the sense of transparency that comes along with this connection is a welcomed dose of reality for a young woman who wants to use her music to help others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/GRAACE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
