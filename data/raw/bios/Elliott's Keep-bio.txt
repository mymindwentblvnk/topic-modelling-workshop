ELLIOTT’S KEEP combines measured Epic Doom with elements of classic Heavy Metal and known Thrash/Death trademarks. Thus the whole sound gains diversion and originality. The widespread epic parts are brilliant at heavy guitar riffs and Doom pathos. Who expects native Doom Rock has to be disabused while listening to “In Medias Res”, because the Metal hammer is fairly swung. ELLIOTT’S KEEP play in fact hot-blooded Epic Death Doom … a diversified, premium instrumental and well produced album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elliott%27s+Keep">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
