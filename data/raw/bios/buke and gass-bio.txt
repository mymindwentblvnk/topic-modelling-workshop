Buke and Gase consists of Arone Dyer (buke and voice) and Aron Sanchez (drums and gass). As far as the name lingo, the buke is “a self-modified six string baritone ukelele” and the gass is “a guitar-bass hybrid.” They both handle all sorts of foot percussion also. Buke and Gase take great care of their sound, both in the delivery of their performance and tone of their unusual homemade instrumentation. Few times does adding distortion to an acoustic instrument work, and it is even rarer that two people can produce such a thick, layered sound. Their songs feature acoustic resonance, a warm and driving heaviness and rhythmic intricacy, combining the best of various styles including the folksy grit of early blues (the same that no doubt inspired Led Zeppelin, to whom Buke and Gase bear resemblance), and progressive/experimental modern rock. Credit must be given to Arone’s extraordinary vocals for the overall vivacity and color of Buke and Gase. From behind a blissful smile effortlessly leaps an explosive, high altitude voice and unforgettable, often exotic melodies. The end result is a new level of performing and songwriting that should not be missed.

As for how they met, Aron builds instruments for the Blue Man Group (he invented the Aronophonic) and Arone’s a bike mechanic (who happened to sing on Blue Man Group’s “What Is Rock”).
