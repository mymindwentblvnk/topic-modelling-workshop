No Living Witness hails from the sodden forests of the Pacific Northwest. The music can characterized as a dynamic intertwining of aggressive technical death and black metal. 

Founding members Sam Haglund(guitar) and Lunchbox (bass) had been writing music together for a couple years before coming across Corey Moore(drums) and L.J.(vocals) to solidify the first incarnation of the band. In 2007 the album Aphotic Awakening was recorded and released. This was a stepping-stone toward the sound that No Living Witness would eventually call their own.  The album contains elements of Swedish/Gothenburg style metal mixed with an American "chunky" brand of death metal. These elements would later be replaced by a more blackend death sound. Aphotic Awakening is currently out of print.

In 2008 Corey parted ways with the band to pursue a career in the Merchant Marines. Shortly afterward Bobby was recruited from the grind band Crawling With Charlie. During 2009 the recording of the self-titled EP took place. During the recording process the band added Tesseract on keys.  Unfortunately Bobby had to temporarily part ways with the band after recording the drum tracks. Luckily Sam came across a drummer from a local band who was jamming with another guitar player. No Living Witness quickly welcomed Cory Jones (drums) and Sam Dixon (guitar) to the band. In the Summer of 2010 the EP was finally released with the added second guitar and keys and Bobby re-accepted his position in the band in the Fall.

No Living Witness is now working on a new album which will be released at some point in mid 2011.
