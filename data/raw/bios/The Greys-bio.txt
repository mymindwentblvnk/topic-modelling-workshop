Unpredictability drives the Texas-born and Los Angeles-based trio THE GREYS—Sydney [22, vocals, guitar, piano, songs], Jayden [21, vocals, production, piano, drums, rhymes], and Silas [20, vocals, piano, songs].   Born to worship pastors who led Texas megachurches, The Greys grew up around music. They can vividly recall working the merch booth and going on tour with popular faith artist Susan Gray—otherwise known as “Mom.” By high school, the three budding writers began creating music together. A song about the tragic passing of their dog made it into the hands of an Interscope Records executive who immediately saw potential during 2014. The siblings packed up and moved west, devoting the next year to writing, producing, and recording countless songs influenced by a shared musical palette that spans everything from Frank Ocean to Switchfoot. After some years the partnership dissolved, this is when the band truly started to discover their own voices.   “The sound is like the color grey,” Jayden leaves off. “It’s not a dark or light color. It’s in between, but it could be used for either one. We make darker music. We make lighter music. It’s a mashup of who we are. We can be everything, but we’re always the Greys”// Management: Kyle@FandomManagement.com <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Greys">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
