There is more than one Unclean.
1. The Unclean were a punk/Oi! band from Detroit Michigan in the late 80's and early 90's. They frequently played shows with bands such as Rival and The Rogues

2. Unclean is a Czech black metal band founded in 1993. They recorded a two-song promo tape the same year and played several gigs in the Czech Republic in 1994 and 1995. In 1995 they released their second demo titled "Tam kdesi v hlubinách" which included 5 songs of occult black/death metal in the Czech style established by bands like Master's Hammer, Amon and Root. This demo was released in 1996 on CD as a split with fellow Czech band Sorath, by Radim Hora's (of Maniac Butcher fame) Pussy God Records. The same label released Unclean's first and so far only full-lenght album "Ten, který se vyhýbá světlu" in 1997. The album's style was more ritualistic and further influenced by Master's Hammer's sound. A follow-up to this album, "Satane, oroduj za nás..." was planned to complete the trilogy started with "Tam kdesi v hlubinách" but that album never saw the light of day.
