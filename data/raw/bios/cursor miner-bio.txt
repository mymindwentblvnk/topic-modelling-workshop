Cursor Miner is an underground electronic music producer from Chichester, England. Signed to Uncharted Audio in the UK, he has released 4 albums, Requires Attention (Uncharted Audio, 2010),  Danceflaw (Lo Recordings, 2006),  Cursor Miner Plays God (Lo Recordings, 2004) and Explosive Piece Of Mind (Lo Recordings, 2002).

His music was described by Uncut as "electro Syd Barrett meets Aphex Twin meets Gary Numan with a touch of early Eno and a nod at Beck". He is also a popular remixer, and in 2005 had an underground hit with his remix of Temposhark's 'Little White Lie'.

His live sets reveal a completely deranged electronic lunacy with the odd occasional punk tendency, which he also applies to professional sound-design for Radio One and relentless and severely warped breakbeat / electro punishment on numerous labels like Lo Recordings, Combat Recordings, Uncharted Audio, Seed, Addictech+Records, Noodles and so on.
