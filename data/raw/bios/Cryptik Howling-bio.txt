Few people capture their inner voice, even less realize their true goal as humans. The mass grows, unaware, living of a society in which the basic foundations are exploitation of raw material and depopulation of other species. Fervent people of religion, science or simple living, they wander their whole life in hopes of salvation, believing they march toward a better world. However, disease, suicide, inbreeding, hunger, maltreatment and slavery are still common in almost every area of this better world. The more the population rises, the more these wounds swell. The happiness of a great twenty percent of this mass is at the cost of agony for the rest. Cryptik Howling offers on a plate a new vision of the world, a chalice full of pus that will awaken even the most sceptics. If on this day, you still haven’t committed suicide, we take for granted that you emancipate in the knowledge of human’s ultimate goal. Its kind is a cancer eating the Earth until its imminent end. Take part in the final descent! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cryptik+Howling">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
