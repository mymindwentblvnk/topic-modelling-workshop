krill.minima is the exotic ambient project of Martin Juhls from Dortmund, Germany. Besides his housy clickdub moniker "Falter" and his orchestral inspired "Marsen Jules" tracks his project krill.minima is about the idea of mixing warmth, emotion and pop-appeal with exotic and experimental sounds, modern soundhack, clicking rhythms and ambient constructions.

Even if his music sounds personally and fresh his influences reach far back to the sound-imaginations and concepts of timeless composers like Brian Eno, Erik Satie, Steve Reich, Stockhausen, Piere Henry and modern sound innovators like Sonic Youth, Autechre, Aphex Twin, Alva Noto and Rhythm&Sound.

"Everything I hear is available material" is a quote by Music-Concrete creator Piere Henry which is very close to Martins procedure of making his ambient music. Most of his rhythm sounds are based on ordinary and non ordinary noises which he recorded in his living room.

Even if this sounds like an experimental way of making music Martin has a quite different approach of creating his athmospheric tracks. "Mostly when I start producing a new track or project I have a clear soundpicture, emotion and atmosphere in mind which I want to make hearable. Then I start collecting the sounds, chords and fragements which I think could work to create a comparable acoustic surrounding."
