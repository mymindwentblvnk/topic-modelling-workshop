Death/black metal band from USA (Chicago). Released four albums:
- 1996 - Mortis Dei
- 1999 - Demonvoid
- 2003 - Forward the Spears
- 2007 - Rise and Conquer

Forest Of Impaled's overall sound is black metal, with brutal death and thrash elements mixed in. While not entirely original, they have come up with a huge sound using only two guitars, bass, and drums (save for a brief orchestral introduction). This epic sound, combined with some great lyrics, make Forward The Spears one of 2003's best releases.
