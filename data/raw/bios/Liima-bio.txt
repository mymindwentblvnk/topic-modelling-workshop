Liima is a band formed by finnish percussionist Tatu Rönkkö and Mads Brauer, Casper Clausen and Rasmus Stolberg - the core members of danish band Efterklang, with whom Tatu Rönkkö has also played.

Liima’s debuted live with a two week residency at Pekka Kuusisto’s Our Festival in Finland in July 2014. The band spent nine days during the autumn in Berlin writing five additional songs, which premiered at a private gathering in Vox-Ton Studio in Berlin and at Rewire Festival in The Hague. 
2015 started in Istanbul , creating new music that was premiered at two concerts at Salon Iksv with further performances in Berlin, Aarhus, Aalborg and Copenhagen. In October, the band along with producer Jonas Verwijnen headed back to Vox-Ton studio in Berlin, recording their debut album ii in just three days, playing everything together live with no overdubs.  It was mixed to tape by Francesco Donatello. Released on 18th March 2016 via 4AD,  ii features songs written in Finland, Berlin, Istanbul and Madeira during four week-long residencies, each place influencing the sound, sometimes literally through field recording and sampling.  Every residency ended with a live concert, performing the freshly written songs in front of an audience.
The album was preceded by the single Amerika in January.
