Matt Relton, known professionally as Kidnap (used to be Kidnap Kid), is an English electronic dance music record producer and DJ from Sheffield, Yorkshire. He is perhaps most notable for being awarded iTunes US's 'Best Electronic Song of 2012' for his track "Vehl". Relton was educated at Silverdale School in Sheffield before completing a degree in Politics and Crime at the University of Leeds.

Relton's third EP and first with Black Butter Records entitled Alphaville was named after the 1965 French film of the same name.

Kidnap Kid is embarking on a new era of his career. For starters, he’s dropping the "Kid." The U.K. producer announced the name change on his birthday, writing: "I was 21 when this all began. Today I’m 26 and feeling ready to turn the page."
Henceforth known as Kidnap, Matt Relton is ushering in the change with a new two-track EP entitled Skin.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kidnap+Kid">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
