Immortal Divination hail from Seattle, Washington with a world wide fan base numbering in the thousands. In late 2005, Orion and Micah Swift (ex-Cryptic Deity, Walpurgis Nacht), published an ad in the Seattle Stranger for their band, Singultus, with a request for a drummer. Jay Hanson (ex-Cryptic Deity, Myrotomy)immediately replied to this call and it was discovered that Jay and Micah were friends and band mates 15 years previous. As it turns out, Jay had accomplished much in his absence. He traveled to Tampa Bay, Florida, for those of you who don’t know is the death metal capitol of the USA. Such bands as Cannibal Corpse, Diabolic, Obituary and Morbid Angel hail from there. As well as Death itself, the original death metal band.

  Dustin Perry (ex-No one Lives), was added to the lineup as well, giving Immortal Divination their most brutal and bone crushing lineup to date. Their musical adventures eventually lead them to Diet of Worms studios back in Tampa Bay, Florida where their demo CD, entitled Crowned, was recorded by the one and only “Punchy” Juan Gonzalez. Punchy has recorded, among others, the new Terrorizer and Morbid Angel. Crowned has been mentioned by some as the most brutal and heavy composition of music ever written.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Immortal+Divination">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
