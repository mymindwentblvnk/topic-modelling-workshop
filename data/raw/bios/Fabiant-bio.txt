FABIANT was founded in 2006 in Gomel (Belarus). Genre – metal. In music they mix such waves of metal like melodic death, Folk, Gothic, Thrash and other. Due to the fact that they combine female vocal with male grunts, you can feel the contrast between extreme and melodic parts of the music. It's like reflection of life: black near white, life side by side death. May be in future they gonna use keys in their songs. At most they consider themselves as the musicians of the classic metal school, but that does not mean that they refuse some new views in extreme music. The lyrics of the band touch upon the global life questions. The questions of life and death, inner world of the human with all his contradictions and relations with external system of society full of stereotypes and other shit. They want to accent an attention at the fearfull tendency of refusing by unique nations of their reach cultural traditions in favour of global artificial standards of being at «new» unificated world.
