Carving out a space somewhere in the middle of garage-punk snarl, shoegaze haze, and Krautrock grooves, Chicago’s Disappears features Brian Case (also of the Ponys and 90 Day Men), Boas members Graeme Gibson and Jonathan van Herik, and Damon Carruesco. The band started when Case’s other groups were on hiatus and he was recording demos with Gibson; Gibson brought van Herik into the project, and in turn, van Herik brought Carruesco into the fold. Soon after forming, the band self-released a series of 7" singles with artwork based on Can’s album Delay 1968, and made their material available for free on the Internet. Disappears began recording their debut studio album and signed to Touch & Go, appearing at the label’s showcase at 2009’s South by Southwest Festival, and also playing dates with Tortoise, Deerhunter, and Times New Viking. The band released 100 CD-Rs of Live Over the Rainbo, a live album from the Deerhunter/Times New Viking tour, that was eventually distributed by Plus Tapes and Rococco Records later in 2009. Disappears continued to play more high-profile Chicago shows, including a gig at the Pitchfork Music Festival and a 2009 New Year’s Eve show with the Jesus Lizard. Late in the year, the band moved to Kranky Records, who released their official debut album Lux in 2010. The band also recorded a single with Sonic Youth’s Steve Shelley and the noise duo White/Light.   - From AMG. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Disappears">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
