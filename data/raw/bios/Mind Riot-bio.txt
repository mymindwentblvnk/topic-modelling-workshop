There are two bands under the name Mind Riot.

The first was a rather strange metal band from Finland. The band started as thrash/death metal band in -90 but developed their style on each release. The last album, Inferno Go-Go, ended up mixing different styles of rock and metal in a way that confused some and was praised by others. The last song ever released by the band (on Suomi Finland Perkele compilation #1) was called Isolation.
The band was active from 1990 to 1998.

Line-up:
Tuomo Saikkonen: vocals, guitars
Juha Javanainen: guitars
Kirill Lorech: bass
Raikko Törönen



The second is a band located in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Formed in 2005 by bassist and vocalist Steven Rose, they started off as a punk band but soon turned their sound to a grungier harder rock.  After entering a number of battles of the bands competitions, they started frequently playing venues in the Twin Cities area in 2007.  Currently they are recording their first EP, set to be 7 songs.
