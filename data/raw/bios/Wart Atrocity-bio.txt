WART ATROCITY is Warty Warthog & Witch-Wart

Warty Warthog:
Raised from the pits of hell he merged with a passion for Metal running through his veins, the only physical emotion maintained after years of being whipped and tortured by his vicious human dominator. Warty left his sty and begun his journey, his pursuit of metal madness, on his travels he met a new companion, WitchWart.

WitchWart:
Is half witch doctor-half razorback, described as a scholar by many and wise by everyone else. He soon befriended Warty and showed his compassion by modifying Warty's front pig trotters by knawing and chewing to accomodate for the use of an electric guitar.
Not a whole lot is known of WitchWart but many speculate he is fully blind.

Wart AtRocity - The Fowl Duo:
Both the Warts handle vocal duties while Warty strings and WitchWart drums.
Together in their musical collaborations they intwine intense writing with a fusion of vile topics into catchy 'Medical Gore' metal grooves.
