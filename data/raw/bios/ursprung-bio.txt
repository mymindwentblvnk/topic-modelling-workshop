Ursprung is a unique old Norse project made by Andreas Axelsson from VÃ¤rmland, Sweden. The instruments used such as tagelharpa, lyres, shamanic drums, jawharps etc are blended smoothly with ambient drone-like sounds along with the greatest music there is: Mother Nature.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ursprung">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
