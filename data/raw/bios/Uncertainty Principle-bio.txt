Uncertainty Principle play a highly unconventional and original blend of funeral and drone doom, dark ambient and noise. On some releases some styles are more prominent than others, but altogether their music is always very extreme, immensely long and slow, and heavy, harsh and uncomprimising. There is only very occasional, slow percussion, and the music is dominated by thick layers of droning, distorted-beyond-recognition guitars...although it's quite minimalistic the music and song structures are also very complex. So, UP creates very bleak, destructive, solemn and sometimes ugly and hateful music, that's also, despite it's extremity, quite emotional, meditative and dreamy.
