Stephen Steinbrink (born in Phoenix, AZ, in 1988) is an American singers songwriter based in Arizona. 

His album, Arranged Waves follows four previous full-length LPs under the moniker French Quarter, as well as a trove of small-run cassettes, CD-Rs and a VHS tape. He has also performed in acts ranging from pop veteran Katy Davidson (Key Losers/Dear Nora) to the cacophonous punk of Pigeon Religion. In keeping with his obsessive home-recorded output, I Drew a Picture broadens his established template of tarnished folk and bedroom pop introspection with delicate synths, propulsive drums and the kind of affecting chord progressions that rumble between relief and sad realization. The songs are Steinbrinkâ€™s most ambitious in composition and lyrical poignancy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stephen+Steinbrink">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
