Montra is a heavy metal band from San Jose, CA. It all started with Lorenzo Madrid on vocals/guitar and Joshua Valeriano on guitar in 2008. Shortly after, Ciro Abraham was picked up for drums along with Jacob Heredia on bass. They began creating their own take on metal, and produced their first full-length album, "Wings of a Fly" and have been playing shows around the Bay Area. They have shared the stage with acts such as High on Fire, Mudface, and Beerijuana, along with other many other local bands. Soon after in mid-2011, Jacob had left the band, leaving Montra without a bassist, so Lorenzo decided to take on bass duties while remaining on vocals, and they recruited Byron Leon on guitar. Since then, they have played with Bonded by Blood and Warbringer and other shows attracting big audiences.

Montra is currently working on a new album, expected to be released mid-2012. They are also making plans for a tour in support of the new album, new merchandise, and hoping to play more shows across the universe to a venue near you. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Montra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
