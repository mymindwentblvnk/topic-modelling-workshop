Sugar Candy Mountain are a psychedelic duo from Oakland, California, principally made up of founders Ash Reiter (vocals and keyboard) and Will Halsey (guitar and drums) as a recording project in 2010. Now, with their latest LP Mystic Hits - a 13-track concoction of reverb-heavy jams - released late 2013, they have added Bryant Dennison (guitar), Tom Edler (bass) and Mike Fortes (vocals and keys) to their ensemble. Citing Os Mutantes and The Beach Boys among their inspirations, their dreamy sound fuses together pieces of surf-rock with astro-pop. They previously released their first self-titled LP in February 2011 followed up a year later with Pepper.
