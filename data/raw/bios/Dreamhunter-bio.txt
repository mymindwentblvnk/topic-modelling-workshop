There are three bands that go by this name:

1) Dreamhunter is a Swedish hard rock band that has released two albums; Kingdom Come in 2000 and Bad Attitude in 2001. Both albums have received a lot of praise in the hard rock press, no doubt thanks to the catchy, hookladen songs.

2) There is also a post-rock band called DreamHunter.
