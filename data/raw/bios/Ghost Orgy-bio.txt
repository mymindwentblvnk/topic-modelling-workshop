Eerily enticing, deliciously dissonant and forever haunting, the sound of Ghost Orgy magnificently defies the boundaries of modern rock music. With loquacious lullabies protruding as from a concupiscent nightmare, the Filipina fronted incarnation takes tonal math and sonic brutality to an emotionally disturbing level.

Powerful presences ostracizing known spectrums, the set of deviant isolationist spirits found through the arduous undertakings of creator/guitarist Meric Sarkhov contrive their stylistic differences as they gelled into their sardonic new form. The beautifully intense and diverse voice of Dina Concina pummels the vocal registry with malicious melodies, her volcanic demeanor unraveling the deepest sorrows and most hidden anguish, growing from and unto Sarkhov`s harmonic densities of crystallized uncompromising pungency, embraces the Transylvanian reminiscent cruelty embroidered into Elena Doroftei`s oily yet skeletal viola sound, while the solid rhythmic backbone of Roy Van Tassel and Stevie Z sums all.

When all is said and done it makes for a mysteriously powerful potion that is to be sipped at your own risk.

Ghost Orgy performs disseminating their invented obscurities in New York and the northeastern U.S. representing their bizarre debut musical offspring Lullabies for Lunatics released spring 2005 on Thoth Music/Black Pumpkin Records/Century Media Distribution. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ghost+Orgy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
