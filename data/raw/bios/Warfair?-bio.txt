Warfair? were a crust punk / grindcore band from Arizona, USA. Taking influence from bands such as Terrorizer, Napalm Death, Excruciating Terror, Rot (Brazil), Dahmer, Warsore, Discordance Axis, and so on, Warfair? brewed up a lethal concauction of nihilistic, drunken, noisy, ear pulverizing, grinding intensity. As of 2011, Warfair? temporarily reunited for a one-off show at Community Outreach Fest in Arizona.
