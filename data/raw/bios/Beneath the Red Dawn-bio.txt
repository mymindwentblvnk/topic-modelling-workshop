Beneath The Red Dawn was formed Autumn of 2004 in Bloomingdale, New Jersey, USA, and have been playing shows since 2005. They released their first full length in February of 2008, which is a rerecording of their first E.P. entitled "This Cold Mourning." The band then recorded "Reverence Obscure." This full-length was released in June of 2009, and is still available. Contact the band to get the release for next to nothing.
