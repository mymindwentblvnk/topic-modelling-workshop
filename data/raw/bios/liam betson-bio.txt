Since 2007 Liam Betson has been building somewhat of a cult persona, releasing music as Liam the Younger and drifting in and out of the public eye. Over the past two years he toured extensively, playing guitar in Titus Andronicus. After an amicable departure from the band last summer, Betson returns with a new full length record of his own.

The Cover of Hunter comes to us as Betsonʼs fourth full length LP, and debut studio effort, following three phenomenal lo-fi records released on New Jersey record label, Underwater Peoples. Produced by Kevin McMahon at Marcata Recording, The Cover of Hunter features friends, Ian Dykstra, Ian Drennan, Alex Steinberg, Luka Usmiani, Patrick Stickles and Julian Lynch. Dynamic, dark and rich with lyrical content, we believe The Cover of Hunter to be Betsonʼs best record yet. The Cover of Hunter will release July 22nd on Double Double Whammy, with tours to follow. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Liam+Betson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
