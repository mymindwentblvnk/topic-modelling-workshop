Thy Sin is an Italian metal band formed in 2005.
Alessandro, Alberto and Giulia (all members of the dead-band Funereal Dusk) joined together and started playing some fuckin' metal. Many musicians were found and lost. At the end, Thy Sin met the second guitarist "Luca" ( Founder of the dead-band Corpus Engraved) and the brutal and powerful voice of Riccardo (Soul Direction).
Thy Sin proposes a metal inspired by different kind of music like Heavy Metal, Death Metal and Prog Metal, but also loves to insert clean voice accompanied by acustic guitars and mandolinoos. In october 2006 they finished their first demo (self produced) "Behind The Unsaid" ... soon available on cd! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thy+Sin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
