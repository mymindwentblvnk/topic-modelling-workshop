Miss Derringer is a Los Angeles based alternative country/goth rock band fronted by singer and underground artist Elizabeth McGrath and her husband/songwriter Morgan Slade.

Miss Derringer is heavily influenced by American music of the late 50s and early 60s - particularly the vintage sounds of outlaw country, early 60s girl group pop.

The band's lyrics deal with "honkytonk" subjects like prison, poverty, sobriety, God, death, marriage, murder, and alcohol.

Miss Derringer has released two albums with Sympathy for the Record Industry. The first King James, Crown Royal, and a Colt 45 was released in 2004.

Their latest album Lullabies includes guest musicians such as drummer Clem Burke from Blondie and was co-produced by Derek O'Brien of Social Distortion and The Adolescents.

In 2007, Miss Derringer released the 2 song ep "Black Tears" electronically, on Stay Gold Records. Black Tears was produced by John Kastner of the Doughboys and All Systems Go!
