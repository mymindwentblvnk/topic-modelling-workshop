Iron Witch are a Sludge Metal band from Liverpool, England who formed in early 2010. Their mix of 'whiskey soaked', bluesy riffs, throat scorched vocals and hardcore punk, tip the hat to the likes of Eyehategod, Black Sabbath and Black Flag.

They released their debut EP entitled 'Single Malt' in early August 2011 through Witch Hunter Records, and have recently released a 7"  entitled 'Post Vegas Blues' via Thirty Days Of Night Records.
