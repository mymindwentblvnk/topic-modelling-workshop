Those Dancing Days were an indie pop band with northern soul and girl-group influences, from Nacka, a suburb of Stockholm, Sweden, formed in 2005. The band consisted of five young girls from Stockholm - Linnea Jönsson (vocals). Lisa Pyk Wirström (organ), Rebecka Rolfart (guitar), Mimmi Evrell (bass) and Cissi Efraimsson (drums).

Two of the band members completed school as late as Summer 2008 and they received a lot of publicity during 2007 including being featured in NME and on MTV2. They were also nominated for the Best Swedish Act prize at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2007.

They released a 5-track EP in Sweden before being signed by Wichita who in turn released the self-titled single, Those Dancing Days in October 2007. A second single followed called Hitten. Their debut full length album In Our Space Hero Suits was released on October 6th 2008, preceded by a single Run Run on September 29th.  
Their second album, Daydreams and Nightmares, came out in March 2011. Later that year they announced on their website 'to put the band to bed for a while'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Those+Dancing+Days">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
