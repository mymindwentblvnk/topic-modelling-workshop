Based in Nova Scotia, Pagan Hellfire is the solo venture of one Incarnatus. The band had originally included bassist Blackthorn for a series of three demos ‘Everlasting Funerals’. ‘Honor Black War’ and ‘Outlander’. These latter two tapes were scheduled for a CD release by an American label but this project floundered. Undaunted Incarnatus released a new set of songs for the album ‘A Voice From The Centuries Away’.

Pagan Hellfire has contributed a version of ‘Frijos Einsames Trauern’ for a BURZUM tribute album.
