Black Boned Angel was a Lower Hutt, Wellington, New Zealand based drone metal project formed in 2004 by experimental musician Campbell Kneale (who also performs solo as Our Love Will Destroy the World, and previously Birchville Cat Motel). Originally a duo with James Kirk (of Sandoz Lab Technicans, The Stumps, The Idle Suite), Black Boned Angel expanded to include Jules Desmond (of 1/3 Octave Band). Black Boned Angel split up in 2013, releasing their final album The End.

Black Boned Angel incorporated elements of drone, industrial, dark ambient and influences taken from doom metal music. The project took its name from the song of the same name by Godflesh, which can be found on their album "Selfless."

Black Boned Angel have released material on Kneale's own labels Battlecruiser and Celebrate Psi Phenomenon, as well as on 20 Buck Spin and Riot Season, and have been compared to artists such as Earth, Sunn O))), and Corrupted.
