The band was founded by Milosz Gassan in Boston in 2005. In 2007, Milosz was joined by Max Furst (bass) and Kevin Adams (drums) and it was here where Morne began to create and develop the band's distinct sound heard today. After just a few months, the band entered a studio to record their first demo. In the following summer of 2008, Morne was joined by Jeff Hayward right before the band's first formal studio recording session for a split 12" with the UK band Warprayer.

After brief touring, Morne unveiled their debut full-length album Untold Wait in late 2009. The album was the culmination of over 2 years efforts and hard work as a group. Morne also invited guest musicians Kris Force and Alicia Morgan to contribute their talents and signatures to further the album's vast concept. Due to artistic and personal differences, the band parted ways with Kevin prior to the album's release. In his place, Erik Larson stepped up to substitute for their first European tour in the summer of 2009. After nearly one year without a permanent drummer, Morne was joined by Billy Knockenhauer in September of 2010 to perform with the band full-time. The band has also since been joined by Ian Shultz to fulfill the role of permanent keyboard and sound manipulation, helping to complete the band's live sound.

Morne has since released two further albums, Asylum in 2011 and Shadows in 2013.
