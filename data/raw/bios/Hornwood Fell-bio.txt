The project was born in May 2013 under the Nineties black metal influence. Among the group’s major influences the fierceness of Ulver’s Nattens Madrigal, the compulsiveness of Darkthrone, the first Borknagar album, Satyricon and Burzum. Rotten sounds. The past recurs and condensates in shadows and noises, dark and obscure woods, stones to stumble upon, dirt in the mouth.
