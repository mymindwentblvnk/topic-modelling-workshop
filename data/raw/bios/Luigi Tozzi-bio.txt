Born and educated in Rome, the young Italian producer Luigi Tozzi was strongly influenced by the roman scene and its local artists, many of whom gave a crucial contribution to the birth and growth of the deep techno sound.

Luigiâ€™s music has so far been released on the established label Dynamic Reflection as well as setting a regular cooperation with the very promising and mysterious techno label Hypnus Records from Sweden, where he found a platform that inspired him to develop his style. Melting the tribal and hypnotic elements of techno with the atmospheric and emotional side of ambient music he is making his own path in the world of electronics.

Recently this has gotten him in contact with Dino Sabatini which led to the opportunity to join Outis Music that has released well known artists such as Modern Heads, Brando Lupi, Donato Dozzy among others.

Besides attracting the interest of Dino, his music has also caught the ears of other great artists such as Claudio PRC, Edit Select and Deepbass who all have made remixes.
