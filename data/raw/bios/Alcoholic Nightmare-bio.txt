In the summer of 2005, Zowie, Dennis, Stef and Stijn were looking for a drummer to play some songs. But it turned out that drummers are hard to find. On Graspop 2005, Zowie meets Steve, a drummer. They talk about music, the band, big tits and alot of fucking beer.

In October/November 2005, Steve joined the band and he moved his drumkit to Zowie's home, where they could thrash out, drink beers and play some music. We played covers from alot of different bands and we also had 1 song of out own: Pintjes(wich is Flemish for beers) wich we had exhumed from our drunken minds in 5 minutes. After a 1 year and a half of playing covers, Zowie tells us that he has a show for us, so we had to start writing our own music. Our first show was in april 2007, since then we have played 25 shows or so. One of those was the Akkerpopcontest, where the audience chose us as best band of the evening wich was a big surprise!!!!! Thats the only thing I can remember from that night... And now 2 years later we are still going on!!!! Yes, thrashing out, drinking beer and playing some music.

November 2008: alot of bad and good shit going down in the A.N. drinking camp, after a long time of personal and musical problems and differences we decided it was best for Dennis to leave the band. We went into the studio (actually the next day) to record our first fucking EP wich was appropriatly dubbed: The New Wave Of Violence EP. We're now in the process of finishing it and getting it out there. Were also working on new songs, and soon we'll be tearing up stages, raiding fridges, puking on dogs, pissing on flowers and decapitating posers near you!!!!!!!!!!!!!
