Drearyym was formed in January, 2014 by two Lempäälä-inhabitants, Leevi Kuunila and Jarno Kaasalainen. With Leevi playing guitar alongside his vocalist's duties and Jarno playing drums, they began pursuing a vision of creating melodic death metal with folk influences. Black metal also mixed into the stew as time went by, and even thrashy and doomy vibes would be heard.
After playing together for a while, the guys had three songs ready to be recorded. As they searched for a quick, low-budget way to get things done, they also realized that they required some keyboards on the songs. They then contacted Leevi's old bandmate, fellow Lempäälä-inhabitant and beginner keyboardist Eero Ahonen. With only less than a month to go before the recordings would take place, Eero agreed to play the keyboards and a guest guitar solo on the soon-to-be first demo of the band, which had also recently gotten a name. The name needed to reflect the music somehow, and the word best describing the music was "dreary", as the songs, though still very unpolished, were ominous and dark. Drearyym was born.
