All Saints is an English/Canadian pop music girl group that enjoyed considerable critical and commercial success. The group comprises founding members Melanie Blatt and Shaznay Lewis, and sisters Nicole and Natalie Appleton.

Their debut album, All Saints, was released in 1997 with the first single "I Know Where It's At" reaching #4 on the UK charts. The next single, "Never Ever", launched All Saints as stars, selling over two million copies in the United Kingdom also.  They later went on to release their second full length studio album, Saints & Sinners in 2000.
The band scored a total of five #1 singles. They split acrimoniously in 2001 after much speculation and rumour. Nicole and Natalie went on to form the duo Appleton, whilst Melanie and Shaznay have also gone on to enjoy (moderate) solo success.

On January 24, 2006 it was announced that the band had reformed. All Saints had signed a deal with Parlophone Records and their comeback single for the label, 'Rock Steady' was a considerable commercial success, charting at number 2. However, 'Studio 1', their third album peaked at a disappointing number 40 in the UK chart. 

A further single - 'Chick Fit' - was released via download only, and the group left Parlophone shortly after in 2009.

In November 2013, it was announced that the group would be reforming to support the Backstreet Boys for five dates across the UK and Ireland in 2014.

"We are really looking forward to performing together as special guests of the Backstreet Boys," the group said in a statement.

All Saints will released their fourth studio album entitled Red Flag on 8 April 2016. The lead single from the album, "One Strike", was released on 26 February 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/All+Saints">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
