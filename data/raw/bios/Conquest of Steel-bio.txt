Conquest of Steel have been hailed as Britains finest heavy metal warriors, and not without due cause. Renowned for their manic live shows Conquest are a band that truly delivers on its promise of true heavy metal.

Clad in denim and spikes these proud flag bearers of the United Kingdom's metal scene have been spilling the blood of false pretenders for years. With the release of their debut album in 2000 they have begun to secure their place in the annals of heavy metal.
