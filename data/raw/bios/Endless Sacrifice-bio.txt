Endless sacrifice began as a Dream Theater Cover band, and consists of Dan Whaley (Lead Guitar), Rob Lombardo (Keyboard),   Josh Zaid (Drums) and Greg Cordts (Guitar/Bass).  They have now branched in other musical directions including Jazz, progressive Rock/Metal and Psychedelic Rock.  Endless Sacrifice is an ongoing project and will hopefully continue to grow. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/endless+sacrifice">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
