Back Door was a British jazz-rock trio from Yorkshire, United Kingdom.

Members Ron Aspery (saxes, flutes), Tony Hicks (drums), and Colin Hodgkinson (bass) wove elements of blues, rock and jazz into an energetic music full of casual virtuosity and arrived on the scene in 1970. The lack of a chordal instrument like guitar or keyboard left Hodgkinson room to fill in chords and even melodies along with his bass notes, and his style defines the band. 

The trio released four albums: Back Door (1972), 8th Street Nights (1973), Another Fine Mess (1974), and Activate (1976). The first of these releases was originally on the band's own Blakey label with Warner Bros taking it over and also releasing the subsequent three.
In 2003 the band got together again to record and release a new album Askin' the Way in association with Cultural Foundation (www.cultfound.org). 

Sadly Ron Aspery died in December of 2003 and Tony Hicks in August 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Back+Door">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
