The name "Dyrathor" goes back to the Edda. It is a slight modification of "Dyrathror", which is the name of one of the four deers that browse between the branches of the ash tree Yggdrasil.

Dyrathor was founded in 2006 by drummer Thurin and guitarist Skrall. The band was completed by bassist Hjul and Joerg who played the syntheziser. After some time of exercising the appropriate voice was found in the circle of friends - Morguul. To extend the sound pattern Atrox joined Dyrathor as the second guitarist and J. as a passionate violinist.

As there was no suitable genre description due to the musical variety, Dyrathor called its style of music "Northern Storm Metal". Middle of 2007 Joerg left Dyrathor and was "replaced" by backing sythies.

Dyrathor performed their first gig on 30 November 2007 Oberhausen (Saint) together with Black Messiah, Obscruitiy and Minjar. The first demo "Memories In Frost" was published on 9 February 2008 (planned publication was end of 2007).
