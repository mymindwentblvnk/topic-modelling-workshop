All We Are is a name of least two bands:

[[b]1] A Liverpool-based alt-pop / psychedelic / folk trio, formed in June 2011. Members include musicians: Rich, Guro & Luis.

They provide gorgeous three part vocal harmonies and kettle-whistling guitars that softly float over flowery basslines and hypnotic drums, often rising from delicately soft & haunting tones to driving & anthemic endings which form the blueprint for their electrifying and absorbing live shows.

The trio, whose nationalities are a mix of Norwegian, Irish and Brazilian, self-released their debut EP in June 2011 before heading off on their debut UK and European tour. 

In April 2012, All We Are released their latest EP ‘We Hunt’ on Payper Tiger Records on both CD and 7” Vinyl. They are currently busy gigging in both the UK and mainland Europe and are also writing their new release which will be available soon.
