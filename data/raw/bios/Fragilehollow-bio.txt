FragileHollow is a remarkable rock band from Helsinki, Finland. It combines elements of hard rock, dark pop, melodic and doom metal. After various line up changes and mini albums the band has found its own sound and is totally genre free. As bands seem to copy and build an image FH is honest and makes it with terms of music it self. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fragilehollow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
