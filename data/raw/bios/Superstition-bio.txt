 The band was formed in winter 2008 by two founding members Vedran (Guitar) and Emanuel (drums). Our goal with the band was to create some Old School Death Metal and show to the scene that extreme metal is still breathing in our town. Soon after the birth of Superstition, the band was baptized with blood of a new memeber Vilim (Guitar). We started to rehearse some Morbid Angel and Cannibal Corpse songs, but also focusing on our own material and sound! Few months later after Vilim joined, the line-up of the band was completed with Ivan (Bass) and Elvis (vocals). The band started to rehearse with full line-up, and everything was perfect, so at the beginning of 2009, Superstition entered studio to record first demo called "Mirrors of Suffering". The band had few gigs so far, and if you have some gig offers, feel free to contact us! Superstition is here to stay, Superstition is here to slay!
