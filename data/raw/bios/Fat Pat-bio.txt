Fat Pat (born Patrick Lamont Hawkins, December 4, 1970 â€“ February 3, 1998) was a rapper from Houston, Texas and an original member of DJ Screw's Screwed Up Click. Also known as Mr. Fat Pat and P-A-T, he was most prolific in the mid-1990's alongside his brother Big Hawk and longtime friend Lil' Keke. Fat Pat was signed to Wreckshop Records.

On February 3rd, 1998, Fat Pat was shot dead after collecting an appearance fee from a promoter's apartment. Two weeks later, his debut album, Ghetto Dreams, was released. His album release party became a wake of sorts with rap artists such as Scarface, Willie D, Lil' Keke, DJ Screw, the Botany Boys, South Park Mexican, in attendance to pay their respects. Four months later, Wreckshop Records released his second album, Throwed In Tha Game, which featured the single Holla At 'Cha Later. Weeks later, DJ Screw and the Screwed Up Click released their group's debut album, Screwed Up For Life.
