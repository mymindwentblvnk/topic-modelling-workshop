.. .. .. Ascending from the abyss, Ferocious Mind brings us brain-melting and bone-shattering sonic abuse. Dwelling in the black forests of Slovenia, conjuring discordant death metal for the wicked infantries. Weaving the spirits from the northernmost fjords and the southernmost deserts, the titans of the apocalypse spare no one on their quest for world domination. Devastation is near, there is no escape, there is no salvation.
