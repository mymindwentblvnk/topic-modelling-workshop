"Infernalfaith" is the black metal sideproject of "Where The Baptized Drown" guitarist "Christian Dusa", also known as "Chronos". It was founded in december 2011, and only after two weeks, he recorded the first demo called "Graveyard Hallucinations". Source of inspiration were bands like Burzum and Gorgoroth, but the biggest reason why Chronos founded the band was the band "Denial Of God". He loved their music so much that he recorded 5 own tracks in 6 days, 6 hours and 6 minutes.
