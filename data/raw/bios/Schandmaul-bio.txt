Schandmaul is a German rock/folk band. The band specializes in a genre of music often known as "Medieval-Folk Rock," because they often include instruments typically used in medieval folksongs—such as the bagpipes and shawms—as parts of their rock sound. Contemporary groups in the same vein include Subway to Sally, In Extremo, Saltatio Mortis, Regicide, and Letzte Instanz.

Schandmaul was founded in the summer of 1998, when six musicians from Munich and the surrounding area decided to put on a concert of folksongs. Because just doing covers was not enough, they decided to write some of their own stuff. Thus was created the first tune they wrote themselves, "Teufelsweib" (Devil Woman), which already had what was to become the typical Schandmaul sound that they've built on over the years. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Schandmaul">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
