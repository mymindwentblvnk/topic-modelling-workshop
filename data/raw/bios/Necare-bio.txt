Newport News, Virginia, USA. (1999-2004)

Necare was a Death/Doom metal band in the vein of old Anathema, Saturnus and My Dying Bride but were also influenced by bands like Katatonia and Evoken. Truly mournful and bleak music for the romantic doom fan. Sporadic use of a violin and other atmospheric elements. They use both grunts and clean vocals.
They consisted of two members, Jonathan Greer Cawthon and Ryan Henry of  Reclusiam . <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Necare">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
