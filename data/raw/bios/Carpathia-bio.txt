experimental electronic dance drag -  Russia

Carpathia started from the ashes of previous thrash band Sanctuary in 2005. Their view was to make music that would match their respective increasing technical and songwriting abilities through their growing interests in both extreme and progressive metal.

Since their conception, Carpathia have performed at various locations throughout the UK and played with many exceptional bands, including "The Rotted", "Abgott","Xerath","Parole" and "Denounce" to name but a few.

Carpathia have had favourable rewviews for their prevously released EPs, perhaps most notably from Metal Hammer where they were described as "...true underground khans".

They now look to release their first full length album and will be playing somewhere near YOU!
