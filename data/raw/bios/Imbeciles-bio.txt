They call their sound “poison umbrella music”…London based electro-punk-hop trio Imbeciles were born towards the end of 2003 out of the remnants of seminal Bulgarian alternative band Babyface Clan, who’s enthralling live performances and exuberant 2001 album “Romantica” were lauded in their homeland, gaining them a dedicated following and a record number of music award nominations, as they toured Europe, supporting bands like Asian Dub Foundation, Stereo MC’s, Dead Kennedys and Transglobal Underground.

While that band had its period of glory and rampage, guitarist Ivo and frontman Nasso (who grew up in London) were plotting a fresh, different sound and thus recruited drummer Rocco to embark on a new adventure, which began with a support slot for Ladytron and would eventually lead them to Britain’s capital – the scene of political dissident Georgi Markov’s  mysterious “poison umbrella” murder back in 1978. 

Already awaiting the Imbeciles in London was a record deal with Marco Pirroni’s (of Adam and the Ants, McLaren/Westwood’s SEX shop and Sinead O’Connor fame) new label – Only Lovers Left Alive. Pleasantries exchanged, spirits drunk, papers signed and Imbeciles promptly joined Placebo’s UK tour on Brian Molko and Co’s request, playing venues like Brixton Academy and Manchester Apollo. 

This was followed by the band’s debut single – “Cool T-Shirt”, which received very favourable reviews, as well as causing discomfort and confusion amongst the “let’s-put-everything-into-a-category” brigade, who couldn’t quite pigeonhole the band’s sound.

Having sold out of 7’ inch vinyl in the indie shops, Imbeciles started the Summer of 2005 joining Racine (Wendy James of Transvision Vamp’s new band)  on their UK tour for some dates and then heading into the studio to record the “poison umbrella demos”…Caustic lyrics, driving beats, a weirdo-funk-rock-ahem-oh yeah guitar, euphoric guerrilla dandyism and one of the most hyperactive frontmen you’ll see, await you, should you chance upon an Imbeciles performance...

”They say romance is a thing of the past…but who knows how long the future will last…” 

 Welcome to the Imbeciles and let the Poison Umbrella murder all prejudice
