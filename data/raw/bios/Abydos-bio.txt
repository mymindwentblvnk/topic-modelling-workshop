Abydos is a solo project of Andy Kuntz, the singer of the German band Vanden Plas. "Abydos" was written as a stage play/musical (or as he himself subtitled it as "a heavy mental shadow opera"), but the play itself had its premiere after the release of the album. It is the official cultural contribution of Andy's home town Kaiserslautern for the Football World Cup 2006 and Andy's first solo project. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Abydos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
