Forget gangster rap. A new generation is leading L.A. hip-hop towards a brighter future defined more by the city's sunny skies than its criminal underbelly. The Dr. Dre figure overseeing this transformation is Polyester the Saint. 
Born in Los Angeles CA, USA Christian St. James Cleveland, Polyester the Saint grew up knee deep in music. His grandfather was the late Rev. James Cleveland, the father of modern gospel music, and his uncle is Jeffrey Daniels of Shalamar and Soul Train fame. His own father, Andre Cleveland, was a producer and promoter whose parties in the 1990s gave a young Poly the opportunity to rub elbows with everyone from Snoop to Usher while still in his teens. A drummer since the age of 5, his plan initially was to become a touring musician.
