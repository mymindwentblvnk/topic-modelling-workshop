The Danielson Famile is a band that plays a quirky blend of Indie pop and gospel music. The members of the band are Daniel Smith and his siblings Megan Smith (Megan Slaboda), David Smith, Rachel Smith (Rachel Galloway), Andrew Smith, wife Elin K. Smith, and friend Chris X. Smith (Chris Palladino). Recently, Sufjan Stevens has joined the band as an adopted member of the family, playing banjo on the album "Brother is to Son" and touring with them when possible. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Danielson+Famile">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
