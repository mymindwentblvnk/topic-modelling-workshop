Seiphian was a Power Metal band located in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, that incorporated Progressive elements into their music. Seiphian was founded at the end of 2006 by Fon Sanders (vocals & guitars) and Joop Lammerts (drums).

In May 2009 some of the bandmembers left the band. In September 2009 Seiphian had a full line-up once again. Next to Joop and Fon Seiphian's final line up consisted of: Alissa Schaeffer (vocals),  Romijn Sanders (bass) and Emiel Zwarts (guitars). In 2010 Seiphian decided not to continue making music due to different visions and ambitions.

Seiphian has released two demos. Passage Burden was released in October 2007 and Ambassadors of Morning in March 2009.
