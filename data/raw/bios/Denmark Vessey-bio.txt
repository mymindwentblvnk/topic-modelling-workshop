Denmark Vessey is a bit of an oddball, but his awkwardness is a part of the charm. This Detroit born hip-hop emcee and producer has become one of our next artists up to bat for the city already releasing noteworthy projects with Quelle Chris under the Crown Nation collective, along with producing tracks for the likes of Danny Brown and Elzhi. Denmark comes off as a nice, humble guy both in person and on the mic.
