Sin Origin is a black metal band from Canfield, Ohio that was formed in 2001 under the name NEXTEPEUA (Aztec for “he who rains ashes“). In late 2002 the band changed the name to Sin Origin, and they recorded two demos (“Beyond the Cemetery Gates” and “Night Aeternal”) in the years to follow but decided against releasing either until they were contacted by BLACKMETAL.COM. Since then both demos and the debut album, “In the Presence of a Dread Magician,” have been released. The name “Sin Origin” deals with “Original Sin”; the initiation of evil in man.
