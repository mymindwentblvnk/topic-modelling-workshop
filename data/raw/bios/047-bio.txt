047 is a bitpop band from different parts of Sweden. It all started in 2001 when they decided to make a christmas album chip-style.
Their 6th album "Robopop - Vi tar CDn dit vi kommer", released 2006, is the first one released on a real record company.

Their music is strongly influenced by the music from the 80's game consoles, like Nintendo and Commodore 64. The music is mostly created on Gameboys or in computers.

In late 2006, Salkin decided to take a pause from 047 to work on his own, while Soda and Pricky promised to keep up the good work. This makes the future for 047 a bit unstable.

047 is pronounced "noll feuwra shew" (Zero - four - seven) in english. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/047">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
