Audrey Horne is a hard rock/post-grunge band from Bergen, Norway. The band was formed in 2002, taking its name from Sherilyn Fenn's character in the cult TV series Twin Peaks. Although some of the band's members play or have previously played in black metal bands like Enslaved and Gorgoroth, Audrey Horne's music is far removed from the black metal genre, and can be described as heavy and melodic hard rock, similar to bands like Faith No More, Alice in Chains.

The band's debut album "No Hay Banda" was released in April 2005 and has received generally good reviews and was nominated for two Norwegian Grammy-awards, winning one of them for "Best Norwegian Metal Act".

The second album "Le·Fol·" was released in February 2008. A European tour was done to support the album.

In 2009 the band went to Los Angeles to record their 3rd album with producer Joe Barresi, who'd earlier worked with them on "No Hay Banda". The self-titled album "Audrey Horne" was released on March 1st, 2010 through Indie Recordings.
