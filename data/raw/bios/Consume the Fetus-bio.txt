Guttural Slamming Sickness From Austin, Texas. Consume the Fetus started out as a solo project in 2007 with J.D. as the front man,only to release a split. In 2009 the sound progressed more into Brutal Death Metal adding Sir Strips-Alot as session Vocals (Menstrual Vomit, Pseudomonas Aeruginosa) on the 2009 Demo.That following year Abidan Cordon was added as the official vocalist, releasing their first full length (Raped in the Outhouse) with Deathmutt/Sevared Records. Now they continue their onslaught rupturing ears,disemboweling people with their sick guttural nastiness, and lacerating cunts with their sewer spewing anal ejaculations that makes Consume the Fetus what they really are: CONSUME THE FETUS
