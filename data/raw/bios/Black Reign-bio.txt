The group first began in August of 1993 when Michael Demov had a vision to form a heavy metal band called Black Reign. He approached Anthony Cipolla to play lead guitar with Demov taking on rhythm guitar & vocals. He gave Anthony the whole rhythm guitar recording of a song which later would be named Unholy Father of which he put some lead guitar to. Whilst studying at TAFE Demov shared a class with a guy named Adam Moxon. They exchanged musical interests then Demov told him he should buy a bass guitar & join him in a band he was forming, so he did. Demov's high school mate Steve Hatzis was after a bass guitar but ended walking out of the shop with drums.
The very first members of Black Reign had formed and the process of song writing began. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Reign">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
