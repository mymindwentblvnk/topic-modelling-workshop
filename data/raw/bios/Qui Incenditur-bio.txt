QUI INCENDITUR is a one-man project formed in December 2010 by G.R. (Onirik & Mors Liberatrix).
QUI INCENDITUR extols the infamous tumult of the ever clashing infinite. It undermines the foundation of man by celebrating the poisonous deceit and assisting the imminent extinction. HE WHO BURNS cites the colossal energies which resound the Universe urging the metamorphosis upon this earth. He is the scout of the fallen. He is the Adversary!
