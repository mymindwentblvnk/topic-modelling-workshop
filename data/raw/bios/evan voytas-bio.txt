Evan Voytas is an LA-based singer/multi-instrumentalist. Hailing from rural Pennsylvania, Evan grew up listening to cassettes of ‘60s and ‘70s pop.  Throughout his high school years he traveled to Philadelphia to study with Acid Jazz luminaries Steve Giordano and Pat Martino.  He continued his studies when he moved to New York at age 18, becoming interested in classical theory and atonalism.  His interest in jazz diminished as he became more reclusive, immersing himself in various religious texts and 70’s new age paperbacks.  Disappearing in New Mexico for a time, he reemerged in New York and was recruited to play lead guitar for big name pop acts, touring the world playing arenas and the television circuit.

Three years later, Voytas returned to his roots and moved to a farmhouse on a dirt road in Pennsylvania where the solitude inspired him to start recording his debut EP.  His music then led him to Los Angeles, where he currently resides. With influences ranging from T. Rex to Daft Punk, Evan’s music evolved into a new sound. Reverting to a spare, minimal pop format, Voytas writes an instantly familiar tune, but frames it with a sonic landscape that simultaneously references ’70s pop and ’90s rap. Evan has recently played guitar in the live bands of Gonjasufi and Flying Lotus and continues to tour with his own backing band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Evan+Voytas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
