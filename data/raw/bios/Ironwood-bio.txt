Ironwood is a  band from Sydney, Australia. Born from the ancestral traditions of Europe, the band is deeply inspired by nature and the animus mundi. While classifying Ironwood within any given genre is impossible, the music contains elements of extreme metal, progressive rock, neo-folk and ambient music. 

The name Ironwood refers to the forest through which any who would travel from Midgard, this world, to the underworld of Hel must pass. Ironwood performs dark, earthy and transcendental music, channeling a visceral journey through chaos and spirit.

Reviews for the debut demo EP:

“This is a welcome voice to the Pagan metal field, and one we will be hearing much more from in future. The question is not whether they will receive the backing of a label and record their full-length; it is simply a matter of when… 9/10.”

“Unique musical vision … some of the most superb lyrics that I have ever read… [t]he thing that does make this band highly original is their ability to combine almost raw black metal with extremely beautiful and atmospheric neofolk … insane solo … [a]ll in all, fantastic EP from a new band”.
