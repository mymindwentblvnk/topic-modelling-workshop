Epic sci-fi Death Metal band from the Netherlands, formed in 2012 by (former) members of Detonation, God Dethroned, Prostitute Disfigurement and Toxocara.

Debut promo released in June 2013.
 Response froms fans to the 2013 demo material was completely overwhelming and with expectations quite high already for this young band, they sit poised to finally release their debut full length world wide on Metal Blade Records.

The album was mixed by Kevin Quilligan and mastered by Stefano Morabito at 16th Cellar Studio (Fleshgod Apocalypse, House of Penance).
