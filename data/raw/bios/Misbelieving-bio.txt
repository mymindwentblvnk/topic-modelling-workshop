The project "Misbelieving" was created in 2003 by Nicola (Guitars,Piano,Electronic Arrangements) and Michele (We Are Building Ruins) on Bass Guitar.
Their aim was to combine Death Metal with many influences like,Thrash,Fusion,technical and fast riffing.
Almost 3 months later,Alex (vocals) joined the band...but no drummers was in the lineup...until the first demo "In The Name Of A God" was released. After the first work,Raphael Saini (Chaoswave,We Are Building Ruins,Corpsefucking Art) on drums was involved in the Misbelieving's project for recording their second EP "Dawn's Silent Grace". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Misbelieving">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
