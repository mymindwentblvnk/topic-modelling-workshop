Resisting narrow stylistic or genre conventions since he first appeared as Low Res in 1994, Daniel Zelonky has emerged as a keeper of the flame of ambitious and adventurous, yet rambunctiously entertaining American music. He has woven any number of improbably wondrous hybrid styles with a mischeivous humor and unabashed over-the-top approach to musical arrangement and expression.  Henceforth, Zelonkyâ€™s work (and band) will go under the name Suite Crude Revue to reflect the increasing propensity to this sort of showmanship.  The previous Low Res albums, "Approximate Love Boat", and "Blue Ramen", have been internationally acclaimed and are currently available again on iTunes and other services, as are Zelonky's two albums as "Crank". "Look Back With Knife", a collection of unreleased, rare & live Low Res tracks, is also slated for release in the near future, as is an all new Suite Crude Revue album.

(note: Juan Atkins never recorded under the name "Low Res".  He collaborated with Zelonky on his "Mind & Body" album, and remixed Low Res' "Amuck")

On Low Res:
DJ, artist, and tastemaker James Dean Brown comments:
"What could be more advanced than merging binary and orchestral sophistication with sonority and venture to result in exhilarated Web Age Neo Exotica on an incalculable level to raise the bar to spiralling heights? The accentuation of novelty in progressiveness makes me feel comfortably psychedelic. The dazzling array of notes equals the colossal sum of permanent energy. The tropical flow by Low Res will ever reflect my favourite affection of escapism."  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Low+Res">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
