Grave Desecration was formed as a Death Metal/Grindcore three piece in 2002. As their sound and skills progressed and members were added, Grave Desecration headed into the studio for the recording of the "Sadistic Mutilation" EP which was released May 2006. During that year GD saw success by playing multiple clubs such as: the Whisky, Knitting Factory, The Boulevard, Cobalt Cafe, The Parkview, and The Key Club and several other big name So Cal venues, opening up for acts such as: Origin, Malevolent Creation, Goatwhore, Exodus, Cryptopsy, Six Feet Under, Deeds of Flesh, Decrepit Birth, Vile, Incantation, Cattle Decapitation. At the height of their popularity, difficulties came with the loss of a few members and the band took a break off touring to start fresh. They are currently in the process of writing new material for their upcoming self-produced album.
