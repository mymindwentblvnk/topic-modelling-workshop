Walk Away Alpha was formed in 2004 by Donovan Spellacy and Trent Odneal. From 2005 to 2008 Walk Away Alpha enjoyed some local success with their guitar intensive brand of progressive rock. The band was able to record a demo independently, get local radio play, and eventually won a "battle of the bands" style donation drive with Reno radio station KRZQ. By late 2009, Donovan and Trent independently wrote, recorded, mixed, and mastered a 5 song metal demo. Once Walk Away Alpha's new, heavier, and more technical material was distributed locally they began to audition for new members. Walk Away Alpha eventually welcomed Josh Mathis as their new drummer. As a three-piece instrumental metal band, the made their way to Mayhemness Recording Studio in Sacramento CA to record a professional six track demo in late 2010. By this time the band was determined to find a singer. Matt McCue’s vocals were recorded and added to the demo and Walk Away Alpha had a successful CD release show at The Reno Knitting Factory on July 12th 2011. The venue reported a 400+ person turn out. In the past year, Walk Away Alpha has created their own website (walkawayalpha.com), made their music available on all major online music resources (iTunes, Zune, Amazon, etc.), and has ventured outside of Reno, playing several shows in Tahoe, Sacramento, and Long Beach. The band has managed to play events with All Shall Perish, Carnifex, Conducting From The Grave, Scale The Summit, Warbringer, Arsonists Get All The Girls, Jamie’s Elsewhere and many more. Walk Away Alpha is currently looking forward recording their first full-length album with Jamie King at The Basement recording studio in NC by late Summer 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Walk+Away+Alpha">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
