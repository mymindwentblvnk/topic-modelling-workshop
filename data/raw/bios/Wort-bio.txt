WORT is a sludge/doom band from Huddersfield. They formed in 2012 from the ashes of previous Huddersfield band Poison Dwarf after some member and slight style refinements.
In 2012 they recorded and released demo EP 'Wort's N'All!". 
After playing gigs with many of their peers and influences, they recorded and released their follow up EP 'Not Your Cup Of Tea'. 
Now working on a split release with peers Nomad to be released in the summer of 2015.
