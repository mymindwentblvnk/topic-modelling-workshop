The Eastern Fashion - 2002

The songs are more agressive than ever, influenced by death metal
and hardcore, but the melodic, progressive parts remained.


Finding Deaf Ears - 2001

The first album. Probably more complex than the songs of Athletitca Devla,
and all the lyrics in English. 


Athletica Devla - 1999

The first studio material of Varso.The music is contains the main elements of today's Varso-style.
