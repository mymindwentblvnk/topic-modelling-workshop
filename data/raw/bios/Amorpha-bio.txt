Amorpha were a band formed in 2000 - 2001 with members Gus Rogers - Founder/Drummer, Barry Meacham - Guitars/ bAcking Vocals, Paul the Priest - Bass, Gavin 'John Cusack' Williams - Vocals. We toured the South Wales Vlleys for one glourious summer and then University stole Cusack away.
They tried to get other singers. 3 came and went but never stuck. Cusack came back and did a few reunion shows but the band split late 2001. They released 3 demos and a live album which was sold in hitman newport. They were also on Tv apparently. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/AmorphA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
