Jadallys, born in 2000, is a true curiosity in the new french rock scene. The band, very exuberant on stage, has been seen opening for After Forever in Paris, for the first Vibes in Paris Fest or in the main french gothic event of 2004 : the Erebe's Festival in La Locomotive. They also are travelling everywhere in France. 

Jadallys is a cocktail of punchy and dark (hard ?) rock with mystical poetry as lyrics, sung in french, surrounded by a main theatrical scenic attitude. 

After a change of line-up, Jadallys is actually recording the second part of its second album, in LB Lab, with Stephane Buriez (Loudblast, Black Bomb A...). This will probably be released at the end of 2006. 

In March 2006, Tibo integrate the Jada-Team, becoming our new smashing engine ! 

Jadallys had already play with bands such as: Lycosia, After Forever, Nightmare, The Old Dead Tree, Leave's Eyes, Magica, Violet Stigmata, Zeroscape and many others.
