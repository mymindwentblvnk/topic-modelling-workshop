Fragore is a heavy, thrash, death metal band from Torino (Italy). Its debut, although short, dates back to 2001, in one year and a half Fragore recorded two demos, a short film soundtrack and had several live performances before the band broke up to born again in 2007 led by the only survivor, leader and founder Davide Nunziante (vocals and guitar).

Despite further line-up changes until 2011 the band succeeds in recording two self-produced albums: "The Dark Side Of Ambition" (2009) and "The keeper" (2011) that draw the attention of dedicated press (Rock Hard, Metal Maniac, Metal Hammer).
During this period Fragore keeps going on with live activity and finally finds the balance with the current drummer Alessandro Baronetto (at Davideâ€™s side since 2007) and the new entry, the young bass player Andrea Lorenti (class of 1994).

Under the expert guidance and production at The Metal House Studio by Ettore Rigotti (Disarmonia Mundi, Destrage, Slowmotion Apocalypse) Fragore records the first professional EP "Armored" released in digital download on 21 December 2012 via Murdered Music. "Armored" has been promoted in Italy (Rock Hard, Metal Maniac, webzines) and abroad (Decibel and Terrorizer). The artwork and the new logo of the band are designed by Rhett Podersoo (Stephen King, My Dying Bride).

In 2013 Fragore appears on the Rock Hard Italy's Metal Yearbook.

At the moment Fragore has completed the recording of the new album "The Reckoning" out on 3 May 2014 in digipak limited edition.
