Folkstone is an Italian folk rock/metal band from Bergamo (Bérghem). The idea was born from Lore, Ferro and Forese, who wanted to bring back to life ancient melodies and mix them with a metal/rock key. At the beginning Lore and his tumbler friend Teo started to play Baghèt, the tipical Bergamo’s bagpipe, and after a few month the medieval bagpipe. Folkstone find their inspiration in the mittelalter rock scene and bands like In Extremo, Corvus Corax, Schelmish and other transalpine folk music bands. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Folkstone">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
