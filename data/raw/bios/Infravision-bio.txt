INFRAVISION is Kendal & Pablo Bozzi. Hailing from Toulouse, southwest France, and both inspired by 80s and 90s sounds, they recently separately released four highly acclaimed solo EPs: Manifesto (Moustache Records) and Inferno (Dischi Autunno) by Kendal, and Walk on Wire (Bite) and Last Moscow Mule (Dischi Autunno) by Pablo Bozzi. Their collaboration started in 2019 with Corpo Meccanico, released on Kendal first EP Manifesto , a Blade Runner-inspired admixture of their mutual, primary inspirations: Italo disco, EBM and early trance. INFRAVISION was born from a desire to push this hybrid sound further, to the format of an album, in order to fully execute their shared vision.

The INFRAVISION universe is set in a dystopian but believable future inspired by the science fiction and anticipation films of the 80s and 90s and our disturbing era. Their debut LP Illegal Future will be released May, 31, 2021, on Zanias' label Fleisch Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Infravision">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
