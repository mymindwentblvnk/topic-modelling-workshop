It lasted when Novian(Vox) and his ex-schoolmates Yudha(Drum) want to make a band.
Then we met a guitarist, Putu. A month later Ryan joined us.
In the middle of 2008 Yudha invited Zent to play bass.
This formation had a lot of problem because of Ryan. He was not serious to complete this band.
So, we decided to replace him with other.
We were still searching a guitarist until on July 2008. After having hard days to find the new guitarist, finally we met Kukuh and invited him to fill guitar position.
We not only found the guitarist but also new tech sound, Yent who can make our music sounds better.
This is our band formation, we don't want it change again!!!
Novi(Voc)^Putu(Guitar)^Kukuh(Guitar)
Zent(Bass)^Yudha(Drum)^Yent(Tech Sound)
