Battlezone was NWOBHM-band formed by ex-Iron Maiden vocalist Paul Di’Anno in 1986 after the break up of his self-titled band, Di’Anno. The band’s initial line-up comprised Di’Anno, guitarists Hurley and Darren Aldridge, bassist Laurence Kessler and Adam Parsons on drums. They recorded their first album, Fighting Back, in 1986. The second album to be released was entitled “Children of Madness” and achieved considerable commercial success. Drugs and infighting again put a strain on the band. Towards the end of the final tour, most members had quit leaving Di’Anno to complete the tour with a backing band in order to fulfill his contract. Battlezone was disbanded in 1987, after which Di’Anno formed Killers, releasing four albums. In 1998 Battlezone was reformed and has been active since.
