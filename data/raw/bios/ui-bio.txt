Ui (pronounced ooo-eee) was an American post-rock band based in New York City, which started in 1990 and split up mid-2000s. They played their first show in about 5 years earlier this year and will be touring and releasing some new material.

The group was started by Sasha Frere-Jones and Clem Waldmann, with Wilbo Wright joining the group in 1993. What set Ui apart from other post-rock groups was their emphasis on bass instead of guitar (Ui had two bass players). But besides their emphasis on bass, Ui also expanded their sound with supporting instruments; such as banjo, synthesizers, tuba and timpani (the group also had a high reliance on samplers and other studio equipment to flesh out their sound further).

Sasha Frere-Jones is also a pop music columnist for the New Yorker. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ui">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
