Groinchurn was a Johannesburg, South Africa mince grindcore band and one of the first to obtain a record contract overseas, in this case with Germany's Morbid Records. The name was given to the band by a friend of Groinchurn's drummer Christina. The band was formed in 1993 with the trio issuing the demos Human Filth and Every Dog Has Its Decay in 1994. The band further released a split 7" EP with Captain 3 Leg and a live 7" EP.
For Sixtimesnine the band travelled to Europe and toured with Krabathor and Sanity's Dawn. The favour was soon returned with Krabathor trekking across South Africa with the Brutal Truth-influenced grinders. The band released an Agathocles tribute CD in 1998 through its own Marbil Entertainment. Whoami was released in April of 2000 in South Africa and, with long delays, in autumn of the same year by Morbid Records elsewhere. The release gave the band the opportunity to tour the USA alongside Total Fucking Destruction. The album proved to be the last CD for the band.
