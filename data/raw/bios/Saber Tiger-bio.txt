There are various artists that go by the name of Saber Tiger.

However, Kinoshita worked around this and signed a major label contract with Tokuma Japan Communications. Saber Tiger's 1997 major debut album, 'Project One', thrust the band to the front of the flourishing Japanese metal scene. The album is essentially a solo album from Kinoshita, with famous guest musicians; vocalist Ron Keel (ex-Steeler and Keel), bassist Naoto Shibata (Anthem) and drummer Hirotsugu Honma (ex-Ezo and Loudness). They have at least 12 studio releases to date.

2) The other Saber Tiger (from Yokosuka) recorded only one 8" EP, some demo tapes and appeared on a couple omnibus albums back in 80s.
