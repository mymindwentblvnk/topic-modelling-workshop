It was early in 2008 when Somesha (guitars) and Ajay(vocals,guitars) decided to culminate a few ideas they had, into the song that was to be the band’s first titled ‘Yuddhabhumi’. The duo’s keen interest in medieval Indian warfare, history, mythology and ancient Indian rituals/magick is what they wanted to portray through their style of death metal and decided to name the band Dhwesha meaning hatred/revenge in their local language. They wanted to give Dhwesha an identity of its own to rise above the paradigm of generic death metal bands and with Ajay’s mastery at being able to write lyrics in their native language Kannada, the duo decided to take the direction that no death metal band from the country ever took. 
In terms of their sound, the band always wanted to preserve the true essence of Death/Black metal which they think has been lost in the course of time. Drawing influences primarily from the likes of Bolt Thrower, Caducity, Unleashed, Destroyer 666 and numerous acts of 80s and early 90s death metal. The band crafted a sound of their own by amalgamating all their influences and upholding the true spirit of the old, whilst concentrating on conveying a message through each of their songs. Dhwesha's music is all about straight forward old school death metal, characterized by staccato riffing, combined with aggression and melody in lethal doses.
In 2011, the band was joined by Tushar on drums which gave complete form to the band and they have been playing live ever since in their city, Bangalore. By January 2012 they released a six track demo tape titled “Yuddhabhumi” through the polish extreme metal label/zine ‘Till You Fukkin Bleed’. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dhwesha">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
