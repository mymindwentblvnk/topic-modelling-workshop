Kairi was a funeral doom metal band from Wales, United Kingdom, created in 2002 as a solo dark ambient project by Kairi Parker-Shikari.
Later on doom metal elements were experimented with and some additional friends brought in to help and the demo "Kairi" was born. "All of My Dreams" expanded on the doom metal elements, and "My Light, My Flesh" expanded on the ambient elements.

Each album focuses around a different concept, musically and ideologically, and so will reflect a different side of Kairi and feature different instrumentation, and 'session members'. 
Kairi chooses often to not use any lyrics for most tracks, instead going for a 'word painting' technique of gibberish or a made up language, with more emphasis on texture and music.

Kairi has decided to continue making music and new information can be found at https://www.facebook.com/kairiofficial <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kairi">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
