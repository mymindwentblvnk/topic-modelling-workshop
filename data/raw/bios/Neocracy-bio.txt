What is "Neocracy?" A new world order? No. The most revolutionary metal band since Metallica? Not exactly...so then, what it is?

Try five of the most metal dudes on the planet. Seriously. If you talk to any member, it's easy to recognize the genuine passion for all things heavy. Not to mention, this band has more hair than any Viking tribe in history.

But besides the nearly constant headbanging, brutal guitar swings, harmonized solo's, and blistering rolls around a gigantic drumkit is the only thing that takes precidence over metal is their love for Jesus Christ.

If you're unfamiliar with the merging of such two seemingly unrelated topics, the answer is simple: they love Jesus, and they love metal. By living out their faith, they extend their ministry to even the darkest, most menacing of places.

At first glance, they are sword-carrying, dungeon and dragon slaying metal heads, and let's be serious, these dudes are tough. But they are the nicest metal heads around.

Add some diehard fans, impressively heavy music, touring and a serious drive to succeed and you've got one of Pennsylvania's most valuable bands.

So come on out, bring a sword, grow your hair, and have fun. And learn how to headbang...that will save you from being the odd one out in the crowd.
