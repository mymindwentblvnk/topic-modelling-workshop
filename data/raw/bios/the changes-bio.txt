The Changes are Darren (Singer/guitar,) Dave (guitar / vocals / songwriter) Rob (bass) and Jonny (drums) & they all man the keys. In combination they make up four of Chicago's favorite sons. The quartet self-produced their forthcoming debut long player entitled Today Is Tonight which will properly introduce The Changes to the world care of Drama Club Records in the US and Kitchenware in the UK and Europe.

The Changes were the only unsigned band on 2005's Lollapalooza, and as a band's band, have played with the likes of Stephen Malkmus, Kaiser Chiefs, Ted Leo, The Futureheads, The Walkmen and more. The Changes have garnered raves and accolades in a slew of the most discriminating music magazines', critics' and blogs' pick lists and radio programs, including Billboard, Time Out Chicago, The New York Times, Brooklyn Vegan (blog), USA Today (blog), featured segments on NPR & KEXP, and even landed in a full page feature in the NME appropriately entitled "The Buzz". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Changes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
