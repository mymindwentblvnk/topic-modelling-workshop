 MORGON was early a black metal band from Alps, formed in 2006 with only two members  Fryderyk-Rod and Nattesheren any two multi-instrumentalists.

 In 2006, they released a demo (dark past) on K7, then in 2008 he went out a second demo (Trve CD-R \-Demo album Do It Yourself)
 In 2010 MORGON adopts new form by the integration of  a drummer and their new demo taking the titles of the demo of 2008 with a much worked version .
 This Third demo is more representative of those plays now and is More insight from their album "Eschon al` Hjerta del valh ".
 Unfortunately this Album is released but still not pressed for lack of money ...

 In 2012,Morgon released the demo  "Greasy vomits from the catacombs."
 Its a new way for the group. MORGON played Trve Black-Metal, now MORGON plays Death-metal, a Old-school, occult and brutal Death-Metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Morgon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
