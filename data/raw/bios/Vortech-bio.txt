Vortech was founded in Finland in 2000 by Juha Untinen and Tero Konola. The style is Industrial Death Metal, combining the speed and technicality of Death Metal with the haunting melodies and futuristic sounds of Industrial. The primary comparisons could be drawn to Fear Factory, The Amenta and Sonic Mayhem. The band has released 7 full length albums to date, with the latest being ...Of What Remains (Sep 2015).

The current line-up is Juha Untinen (guitars, bass, programming), Ville Miinala (drums), and Mikko Nikula (vocals).
