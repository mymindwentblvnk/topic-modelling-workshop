Pripjat was found 2011 in Cologne, Germany. Two Band Members (Kirill and Eugene) actually come from Kiev, Ukraine. That explains the Band Name (Pripjat is the ghost town near to the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant). 

The Band plays a fresh version of the good old thrash - everything goes, as long as it kicks ass. And it does.
