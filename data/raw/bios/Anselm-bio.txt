Czech melodic death metal band from Ostrava, a city in Silesia, Czechia. Some of the lyrics are poems by Petr Bezruc, a poet born at the end of 19th century. Those, along with other lyrics are mostly centered around mine industry because Ostrava used to be a bastion of coal mining. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Anselm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
