Antarctigo Vespucci is an indie rock duo composed of Chris Farren (Fake Problems) and Jeff Rosenstock (The Arrogant Sons of Bitches, Bomb the Music Industry! & Kudrow). Farren and Rosenstock began recording as a band in early 2014 with their debut EP Soulmate Stuff, with Benny Horowitz of The Gaslight Anthem on drums. They released their first full-length album, Leavin' La Vida Loca, in 2015. The band explains their name as a joke: "Amerigo Vespucci is the guy who discovered America so it stands to reason that Antarctigo Vespucci would be the guy who discovered Antarctica." On August 22, 2018, it was announced that the band had signed to Polyvinyl Record Co. On October 26, 2018, they released their second full-length album, Love in the Time of E-Mail. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Antarctigo+Vespucci">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
