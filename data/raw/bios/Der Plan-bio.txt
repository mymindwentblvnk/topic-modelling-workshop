German experimental band from DÃ¼sseldorf.
Started of with very experimental music, but evolved to more 'accessible' music when Pyrolator joined the band. They formed their own label Ata Tak and released something like 10 records, the last one dating from 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Der+Plan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
