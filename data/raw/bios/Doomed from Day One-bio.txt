Rapidly climbing the ranks of the UK metal scene, the extremely tight unit known as “Doomed From Day One” have quickly built momentum with their savage live shows and impeccable musicianship. Cunningly merging the key elements of Prog, Tech and Death Metal, DFDO have created a fiery hybrid that truly engages these components to create their own ferocious package. The fall of 2011 saw the band’s first EP be well received by all of the UK’s well respected publications, also receiving recognition in the States. Their intense touring schedule and dynamic drive has seen them perform at an impressive number of shows all over the UK and in other parts of Europe. The past couple of years have brought the band to share stages with likes of The Black Dahlia Murder, Sylosis, Bleed From Within and Thy Art Is Murder. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Doomed+From+Day+One">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
