Desolate Void was formed in 2003 by Asinine Solution guitarist Pat Sova along with Tim Smith and Andy H. from Invicticus. A bassist was later added as was Matt McNallie as the second guitarist. Changes started happening in 2004 when the bass player went AWOL. After a few months McNallie relocated to the Twin Cities to attend school. The 3 core members still wanted to remain a 5 piece, so Nick Carroll, former bassist for Legion of Doom and CAH Records boss, came on board to provide the low end rumble. Around the same time Invicticus bassist, Brent K, was getting the urge to play guitar again. The current line up started rehearsing in the summer of 2005 and geared up for recording and gigging.
In November 2006, Pat was in a terrible accident which has left him disabled. Long time friend of the band, Mark Stolp, was asked to play guitar in Pat's absence. The band raged and wrote the material that you can hear on their newest release No Sign of Better Times that was recorded in the summer of 2008. Although one may think by looking at the album art that this disk is some sort of social-political commentary on the current state of the world, it is not. The lyrical and album art themes deal with personal hardships and anguish that never seem to let up. No Sign of Better Times is also available through www.cahrecords.com and at www.cahdownloads.com for those of you who no longer wish to have a physical copy. Look for an up coming 3 way split CD with South Carolina's The Last VanZandt and Appleton Wisconsin's The Parish. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Desolate+Void">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
