Tread the Blood are a 5 piece death metal / black metal band spewing from the abyssal rectum known as Evesham, UK. We're writing a new set at the moment and are planning on returning to the studio to nail the new bastards down before the end of the year. We attempt to gain new fans everywhere play and so far I hope we've achieved that. Yes, we like a good old beatdown, but we rarely play them. Too many bands are getting low and dancing around on stage, we pride ourselves on playing as fast and as tightly as we can. So far the new material is quite varied; the first of them is a fast and technical song called "tech death" ;], the second being a black metal influenced track (the taster above) entitled "Embellishment", the third in progress is another technical song but more old school, along the lines of architects and knights of the abyss, another song I have in the writing is a Beneath the Massacre style song which should be fun. Either one of those'll be recorded later this year, until then, come check us out to hear 'em live. I hope you shit your pants to 'em.
