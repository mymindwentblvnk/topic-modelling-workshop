Two bands with this name:

1. Black Juju is a stoner/doom metal band, the natural continuation of the band in vain, that was active in Larissa, Greece from 2001 to 2011 when the name was changed. The band is consisted of pioneers of metal in the area and has its first record out containing old In Vain material.

2. Black JuJu formed as a D.I.Y. southern rock/hardcore band. Their existence as a band is compiled frustration and heartache and we feel that our music and lyrics embraces and projects a message of that 10x over. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+JuJu">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
