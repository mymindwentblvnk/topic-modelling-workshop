For a little over two years now A Red Dawn has been slaying the metal scene in Adelaide like it was their own. Building a reputation as “…one of the most powerful acts on the Adelaide scene” like other Adelaide bands I Killed The Prom Queen, Truth Corroded and The Rivalry have done before them. Perhaps the reason for their fast rise out of obscurity is due to the bands relentless work ethic and fun loving attitude. “Being desperately hooked on music” is the way drummer, Adam, describes their commitment to the band “and desperation is a strong adjective”. It may just be that ‘desperation’ that is helping A Red Dawn to stand out above other bands. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Red+Dawn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
