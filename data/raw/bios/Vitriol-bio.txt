There are six projects sharing the name Vitriol.

1) Vitriol is a very private, inward-looking project from Godflesh's Ben Green. It's the result of a year Green spent in a remote cottage in Wales's Cambrian Mountains, where he lived in isolation, listening to emotional sounds from within and the elemental sounds of nature. His Vitriol release, made only with an eight-track, a guitar, and a few microphones, is a record of the experience. 

2) Vitriol is the name of a swiss-based electro project consisting of Angelo d'Antonio, Giuseppe Cottone and Enzo di Caprio. Check them out on MySpace.

3) Vitriol is a 4-piece metal band from Atlanta, GA. Its members are Jason Sokolic, Chris Linck, Joe Kushnick, and Ryan Brown. They recently released their self-titled EP, and can be found on Myspace.

4) Vitriol is a (currently) three-piece death metal band from Portland, Oregon. They were previously known as Those Who Lie Beneath, but following member changes and a change in musical style they have renamed the band Vitriol. Kyle Rasmussen is the vocalist and guitarist, while Simon Dorfman is the drummer and Adam Roethlisberger is the bassist.

5) Vitriol is a Heavy Metal band from Montpellier, France. They released three demos and one full-length album in 1986. See also: Vitriol
