Sam Kazerooni started recording his own guitar-based compositions at age 15. His inspirations at the time were mainly 80's metal bands, influences such as Annihilator, Black Sabbath, Megadeth, Iron Maiden and a host of solo guitarists; Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Yngwie Malmsteen to name a few of many.

In 1997 Sam decided to further his career options in Dubai and met Rob Storm, ex-Verve producer who eventually helped him record his first album, Vision, comprising of 16 instrumental rock tracks. Two years later the album was complete, and in early 2000 was finally signed to a local record-label, SIDI, then a licensee of BMG (now BMG Middle East North Africa).

In March of 2003 Sam was introduced to Canadian producer Paul Herspiegel. Along with Abhorred death-metal drummer Pravin Mukhi, and roughly eight months later, Angry Planet was born, a 16 track tour de force of instrumental heavy-metal.

In 2006 along with Kiran and Tarun Sequeira work started on Delve, his latest offering at the time comprising of a barrage of progressive rock tracks and ballads. Delve was released in 2007.

Sam Kazerooni has received numerous mention in Middle East based magazines and articles and has seen several positive reviews on North American and European webzines. He is a member of SOCAN (Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada) and is currently signed to an indie American label, Fossil Records, based in Godfrey, Illinois.

Sam is currently living in Vancouver, Canada and just made his new album, Light It Up, released late 2010.
