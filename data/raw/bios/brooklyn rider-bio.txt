The multi-faceted string quartet Brooklyn Rider is becoming increasingly known for its creative programming and exciting collaborations which serve to illuminate music in new ways and invite audiences into a shared experience. Uniquely able to address a wide and inclusive range of music, they are as willing to explore the world of Haydn as they are in the music of our time and have performed in venues as varied as Joe's Pub in NYC, Todai-ji Temple in Nara Japan and the Petronas Towers in Malaysia.  Born out of a desire to use the rich medium of the string quartet as a vehicle for borderless communication, all of the musicians have enjoyed diverse careers in music that have intersected with each other over many years. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brooklyn+Rider">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
