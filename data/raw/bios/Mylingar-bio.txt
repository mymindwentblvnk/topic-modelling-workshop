‘Mylingar’ is a Swedish word that is the plural of ‘myling’. It’s a Scandinavian legend that speaks about ghosts/spirits of unbaptized and/or unnamed children that have been forced to roam the earth until they could force someone to name and/or bury them, in fact ‘killing’ them for real so they can finally rest. In a way, they haunt people in order to get killed/buried. They haunt lone wanderers in the woods, jump on people’s backs and demand to be carried to a graveyard. They are very aggressive and become heavier as you come closer to the graveyard, so that you might sink into the ground carrying them there. If you don’t do as they ask you, they might kill you in a rage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mylingar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
