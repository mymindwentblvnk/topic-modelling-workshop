Pandora is a heavy metal rock band formed in Maringá, Brazil in 2000.

Initially called Wind Of Fate, it was started by a group of friends from Maringá, Brazil.  The group underwent several lineup changes until Natália Ferlin joined in 2001.

It was not until two years later when they found a permanent bassist, Jhovanny. Panndora absorbed in classic heavy metal influences, but when creating original songs, their style is more power.

In 2003 Panndora was ready to record their first demo, “Choose Your Side”, which appeared in October containing two songs, “Choose your Side” and “Other Life”, selling over a thousand copies.

Following the good response the band decided to record their first album, but amid the process Jhovanny and Natália left the band and everything was delayed. It was not until 2007 that Aline Rizzato, Camila and Taise entered joined Panndora, and resumed the recording of “Panndora”, the Rio band’s debut album.

Even so, the original recordings also appear on the album, which are sung by Natália Ferlin (“Nightmare of my Essence”, “Wild Battle,” “My Heretic Lips”, “Killing Yourself”, “Choose your Side “and “Other Life”) and Aline Rizatto (“Black Sky”).
