Italian Midryasi was born in the winter of 2002 with the idea of creating a heavy sound inspired by doom and psychedelic rock. The name Midryasi comes from the dilation of pupils in hallucinative, emotional or death state and it reflects both the heavy dark and the psychedelic side of the band. Midryasi sounds like Black Sabbath, Hawkwind and Pentagram but at the same time it manages not to sound like them at all. Their mix of doomy, psychedelic and extreme influences has a strong personal appearance which makes them at the same time familiar sounding, yet still very original. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Midryasi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
