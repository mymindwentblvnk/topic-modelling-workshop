Karbo is a metal band from Groningen (the Netherlands) and started playing around 2000. During the early years Karbo released 3 EP’s which received good reviews and the band played well over a hundred shows and festivals like Eurosonic, Noordschok and the Booch festival with bands such as Born From Pain and Dillinger Escape Plan. 

Around 2006 Karbo decided to take their songwriting as well as their sound to another level. Therefore the band asked Marc to join in as their second guitarist. 
Recently Karbo has written 12 songs which will appear on the band’s first full-length CD Crossing Borders.
