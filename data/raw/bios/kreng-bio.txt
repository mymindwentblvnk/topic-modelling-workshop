Kreng is a Belgium based project formed by Pepijn Caudron. Started out as a strictly sample-based project, incorporating sounds from various sources: dark jazz, new electronic generated sounds, classical modernism and vintage geographical recordings. The project became a very cinematic, theatrical device that has been used by various directors.
Kreng has now scored more than 15 theatre and dance productions, most of them produced by Abattoir Fermé's director Stef Lernous and free-lance man Piet Arfeuille. Kreng has been involved in some collaborative projects with various members of Belgian musical underground. Among them Sakuran and drummer Eric Thielemans.
Kreng released "L'autopsie phénoménale de Dieu" in 2009 and "Grimoire" in 2011, both on the excellent Miasmah label (artistic co-ordination by Erik Skodvin, aka Svarte Greiner / Deaf Center).
