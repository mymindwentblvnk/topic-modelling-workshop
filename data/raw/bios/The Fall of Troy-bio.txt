The Fall of Troy is a post-hardcore trio formed in 2002 in Mukilteo, Washington, United States. The lineup consists of Thomas Erak (guitar, vocals), Tim Ward (bass, vocals), and Andrew Forsman (drums). Tim Ward left the band in 2007 and was replaced by Frank Ene.

On February 26, 2010, Thomas announced that the band were parting ways following their upcoming "The Marked Men of 2010" tour. Between 2010 and 2013, he formed Just Like Vinyl and joined Chiodos. Andrew Forsman also joined The Monday Mornings, and Frank Black joined Chineke.

The original lineup of The Fall of Troy reunited for three nights in December 2013 in Austin, Texas. Each night, the band performed one of its first three albums (The Fall of Troy, Doppelgänger and Manipulator) in its entirety. During the VIP reunion show, the band announced they would continue making music in 2014 by releasing a free album.

The new album, titled OK, was self-released on April 20th, 2016 (three weeks after its formal announcement) through the band's website for a pay what you want model, in addition to a vinyl release. 

As a followup, on May 20th, 2016, the band released an alternate mix of OK simply titled OK #2, which bears more resemblance to their earlier material and production sound. "OK#2 represents a different version of us; the raw fury you hear at our shows and our earlier albums." The band later released instrumental versions of both mixes, entitled OK #3.1 and OK #3.2
