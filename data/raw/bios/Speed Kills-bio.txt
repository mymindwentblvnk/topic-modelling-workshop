Speed Kills has began in the beginning of 2009, as a project to play like the English, Brazilian and Scandinavian so loved bands: a mangel, fast and furious d-beat, inspired mainly for Mob 47, Discharge, Shitlickers, the "Pick Your King" ep by Poison idea, Ratos de Por√£o (and the legendary Brazilian compilation "Sub") and so on. With members from Discarga, BUSH and Alarme - involved on the punk scene and colectives since a while - and after furious shows with a singular atmosphere, including from dark primitive images to post-apocalyptic noises, there's an outcoming 7" and a debut 12"LP being planned. A sweet revival of mangel crust from scandinavia mixed with brazilian 80's anger. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Speed+Kills">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
