Ras Algethi was an Italian doom metal band, formed in 1993 in Milan. They are one of the pioneers of the funeral doom genre. Prevalent elements are lurching, abysmal rhythms, church organs and dense, immersive atmosphere.

The band released two recordings; the 1993 demo "Oblita Divinitas", and a full length in 1995, "Oneiricon - The White Hypnotic". They disbanded soon afterwards. Key members went on to form the band Canaan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ras+Algethi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
