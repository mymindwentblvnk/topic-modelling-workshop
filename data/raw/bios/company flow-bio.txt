Company flow was a New York based hip hop group, consisted of El-P, Bigg Jus and DJ Mr. Len. Their 1997 debut album Funcrusher Plus is often cited as the catalyst for the new type of underground hip-hop scene that emerged in the late nineties. A Co Flow collaboration with Juggaknots and J-Treds appeared in 1998 under the name Indelible MC's and was featured on the Lyricist Lounge comp. 
The group disbanded in 2000 after Bigg Jus had left in 1999. As a duo, El-P and Mr. Len released another instrumental album called Little Johnny From the Hospitul, after which each of the elements pursued their solo projects, El-P expanding the roster of his label Definitive Jux and Mr. Len giving life to Dummy Smacks Records.
Bigg Jus started up the label Sub Verse Music which temporarily became a distributing point of conscious, independent hip hop. Currently Jus is living in Atlanta, having released several solo and collabo records.

In 2007, the two Co Flow lyricists temporarily re-joined on stage at the CMJ Music Festival in New York. The 10 year anniversary re-issue of Funcrusher Plus, to appear on Def Jux (and for which Co Flow were supposed to be recording new material) has been delayed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Company+Flow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
