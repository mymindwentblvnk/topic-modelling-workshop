KJELD was found & forged around 2003/2004 in the outmost northern parts of the Netherlands called Frisia.
Once only ment to be a mere side project, who would only write and release music without doing any live rituals the whole project slumbered untill 2008. 

In the winter of 2009/2010 KJELD recorded the debut EP "De Tiid Hâldt Gjin Skoft", this was released in februari the same year.
The debut EP received many positive feedback from the international underground scene & this resulted in some live rituals played alongside some of the most respected international black metal acts that same year on various occult festivals!

In 2011 Asega, at that point the vocalist, leaves the band and the band resides in slumber again, in the meanwhile writing and finishing it's first full length album.
In May 2012 the recordings for the new KJELD album started and this new death ritual is set to release on mankind in 2013!
