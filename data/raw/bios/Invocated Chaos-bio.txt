INVOCATED CHAOS stands for multi-layered Death-Metal 
since 2003. The five guys from Witten offer not only 
heavy guitar-riffs and groovy growls but also 
earcutting hooklines and screaming soli.

Since 2004 they have released their first Demo and
rock over several stages in and around Witten(GER).
2006 the first Longplayer "First Arise" came out. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Invocated+Chaos">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
