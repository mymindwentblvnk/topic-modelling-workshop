Shane Yates born in Melbourne Australia some time in the 80's 
became obsessed with computers & music at an early age & started to tinker in his bedroom, creating sounds then arranging them into every type of musical genre from symphonic arrangements comprising the sounds of a full orchestra through to easy listening pop. With no formal training in music & with incredible talent Shane compiled a massive library of original material of outstanding quality by the age of 14. To this day Shane is an under rated talent, a sleeping giant in electronic music production. Hailed a genius by the likes of Christian Smith, Cisco from the Advent & many other in the dance music scene, Shane continues to create & release his works on obscure electronic music labels across the globe. A true talent, a sleeping giant. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alpharisc">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
