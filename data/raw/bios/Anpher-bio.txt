Band was formed in Rīga, Latvia in late summer of year 2004 when Miks and Andrejs decided to spend their time to create sound they like - death metal.

Soon enough Anpher found bass player Reinis who helped them to continue their work with new ideas. They were not so lucky while searching a drummer. Probably it's a problem for almost all new bands out there but, after months of trying and searching, Uldis had joined Anpher. So Anpher decided to play some shows and the first thing they were sure about – Anpher needed a second guitar player.

Until winter of year 2005 Anpher were playing with one guitar, when Kaspars then joined Anpher.

In January 2006 Anpher all together recorded the 4 song demonstration material at studio Fēnikss (Rīga, Latvia). In April 2006 the band played their first show abroad in Šiauliai, Lithuania in festival "Tvaikas III". In August 2006 Anpher parted with their bass player Reinis due to him being busy with his education and not much time left for the band. A month after the new bass player Kristaps, which is also playing bass in band Navela, joined the band.

Anpher split up in year 2007 - most of members are still continuing their musical activities.

Andrejs Koļesovs - vocals (currently 9horizon);
Miķelis Folkmanis - guitar;
Kaspars Ižiks - guitar;
