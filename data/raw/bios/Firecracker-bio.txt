There are 2 artists with the name Firecracker.
1.)
The band Firecracker started some years ago and is the brainchild of Stefan Lindholm (Vindictiv). Before Vindictiv was formed Stefan contacted keyboard maestro Pontus Larsson and they started to work on some of the songs he had laid down. With bass player Fredrik Folkare (Unleached) and Hasse Worzel on drums the band took shape. Vocalist Tommy Karevik (Seventh Wonder) took care of the vocal duties and the basis of Firecracker came to a reality.

Musically the band is everything you would expect and more from Sweden.
