doom metal of four women from Switzerland - with an angry and evil sound...
slowly squealing, stormy, black and deeper than the ground...
sister death and white sky: be warned
that's shEver.
Their line-up is fixed since February 2004, except the drums (since 2007)
In the same year, the 3-track demo "The Mirror" has been recorded.
After that, shEver gave concerts on numerous Swiss stages (for example Dachstock, Bern/Abart, Zürich/Sommercasino/Basel, Bikini Test/La-Chaux-de-Fonds) and also abroad (in France and Austria), together with some interviews and (live-)reviews.
The first full length album "Ocean of Illusions" has been recorded in summer 2006 at Basel City Studios with Dave Ponzio (DPP Production) and has been released at the end of summer 2007.

In 2008, shEver toured a lot, 2 concerts with My Lament (Belgium) in Belgium (@ The Factory, Liège and @Negasonic, Aalst), 2 concerts in Austria  with Saturnus (DK) and Mar de Grises (Chile), some concerts in Germany and mini-tour with Esoteric (UK) through Germany/Switzerland.

In January 2009, a new EP (4 songs) called "A Dialogue with the Dimensions" has been recorded by Mario Hahn (My Shameful) which will be released in spring 2009.
