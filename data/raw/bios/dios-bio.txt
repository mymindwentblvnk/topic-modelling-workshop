There are multiple artists using this name:

1.  Dios was a band from Argentina that started to play in 1992, their name comes from the Spanish word for "God". They finally released an album in 2001 with 19 songs. The group split up a few months after the release of this first and last album.

During their existence the group gained the status of a cult band. The lack of a guitar gave Dios a very claustrophobic sound that exalted the hypnotic sound of the drums and the bass. The music critics have tried to classify Dios sometimes as punk, sometimes as darkwave, sometimes as no wave, sometimes as trip-hop.

Their music was probably influenced by the very early sound of Swans, Suicide and Joy Division. The lyrics of Dios were often very close in style to the poetry of Tango and its Lunfardo, offering a romantic and yet critic ode to the low life of Buenos Aires.

2. Dios is a Japanese band consisting of Tanaka also known as Boku no Lyric no Bouyomi, Ichika Nito and Sasanomaly.
