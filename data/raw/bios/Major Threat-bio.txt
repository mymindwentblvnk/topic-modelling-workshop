1. Major Threat is a post-band project formed by strung-out degenerates from Orlando, Florida, United States. It was founded in December 2013 by the rightful heir of Ian Mackaye, the self-proclaimed “Pamthrax” (vocals, mind manipulation, blasphemy) and her music partner Alberto Balsalm (other devices of mass corruption). The duo describes their lack of sound as a hybrid of many genres, but the fans refer to their work as “post-music.” The live performances are known to be extremely violent because of the aggressive vocalist. The band writes and performs original material, but they also play doom metal / sludge covers of Minor Threat, Fugazi, and RuPaul.

The non-music is influenced by the music tastes of the non-band members. This includes industrial, glam rock, punk rock, hardcore punk, post-hardcore, extreme metal, sludge, electronic, ambient, post-punk, gothic rock, psychedelic rock, noise rock, post-rock, shoegaze, and alternative rock.
