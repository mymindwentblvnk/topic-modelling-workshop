After 8 years away from the death metal scene, guitarist Robert Sennebäck (one of the founding members of Dismember and Unleashed) felt a strong eager to return and start creating music again. A lot of old written material was found, too valuable to be unheard, gave the inspiration to build up a new band from scratch.

The vision of the band is of course to be old school, the way the music sounded from the beginning, back in the late 80s. To create such music, Souldevourer only consist of already well known people that have the right experience of the death metal scene and its development from the old days and have the right attitude and strong passion for the filthy early sound.

There will be no demos or pre-productions released officially, so interested record companies are welcome to contact the band through the band's website to discuss a possible agreement. Magazines and Fanzines are also welcome to book or send interviews to the same address.

The current line-up is:

Robert Sennebäck - Guitar & Vocals
Joakim Sterner - Drums
Ola Lindgren - Guitar
Daniel Ekeroth - Bass <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Souldevourer">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
