Phobic was a group of four friends from Massachusetts who released their one and only album to friends and fans in their area in 2002.

The band consisted of four members:

Pat Kenna (Vocals, Guitar, Violin)
Andy Loven (Bass, Vocals)
Pat Powers (Guitars)
Jon McCormack (Drums)

Phobic played gigs around their area for some time before eventually disbanding when the members left for college. The band faded into obscurity before they could gain any fame besides that among friends and the few gigs they played for. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Phobic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
