Contamino (Spanish for "I pollute") is a Swedish Black Metal band.

Contamino formed in 2000 as a two-piece band featuring Per Ahre (ex-Stabwound) on bass, guitars and drums and Komm. Richard on vocals. A session drummer called Viktor also recorded with the band.

Apart from a single demo in 2001, Contamino's only recorded output was a split release with Arckanum in 2003. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Contamino">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
