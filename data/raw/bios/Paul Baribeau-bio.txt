Paul Baribeau's warm, witty sounds and gnarly beard bring something truly unique and interesting to the folk-punk table. The South Central Michigan native collaborates often with friends such as Matty Pop Chart and Kimya Dawson, but has two self-released ("25" and "Unbearable") and two Plan-It-X released ("Paul Baribeau" and "Grand Ledge") solo albums, plus a very interesting Bruce Springsteen covers album.
