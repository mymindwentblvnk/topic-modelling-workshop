There are two bands called Eisenhower.
1) A Dutch rock band
2) A Swedish band

1) In 2008 4 friends decided to combine their love love for rock music and started the band Eisenhower. With this band they try to cross the bridge between the classic rock gods and rock music nowadays. They have won Rode Oortjes and stood in the final of the Pop Talent awards. They just released their debut album Enough.

2) Resides on the west coast of Sweden in a quiet and cosy little town called Halmstad. We think music always should be nice. Nice songs, nice vocals, nice guitars and nice drummachines. That's what we bring to you! We sing about sunshine and celebrate the coming of spring (all year around). Thats the main purpose of music! At this moment 5 CD-Rs are released, one compilation CD-R and a contribution on the Heavenly Pop Hits compilation CD "Hit Music Only". Six live gigs are accomplished. Best remembered are the "Mitt BÃ¤sta Liv"-festival, Starke Adolf Popklubb and Delicious Goldfish Brunchpop.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eisenhower">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
