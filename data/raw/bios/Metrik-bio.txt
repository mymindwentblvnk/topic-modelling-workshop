Tom Mundell a.k.a Metrik is a London based DJ / producer who has been blowing the scene to pieces with his euphoric, rave-inspired productions. Already clocking up a sizeable back catalogue of releases on labels such as Viper Recordings, Spearhead and Shogun Audio, he signed exclusively to Hospital Records in October 2012.

Known for impressing crowds across the UK, Europe and across the world with his peaktime dancefloor tunes featuring big hooks and catchy melodies, Metrik has certainly captured the imagination of many fans already and will undoubtedly continue to do so in the coming months and years. With diverse tastes ranging from Eric Prydz to Incubus, Pink Floyd to The Prodigy, Metrik’s love of music doesn’t stop there. An avid fan of 80s synth music, film music as well as dance music across the board, his influences span house, techno, trance, rock, soul and classical.

Metrik’s first big break was in 2008, when he debuted with Your World (Instrinsic) which became an overnight liquid funk anthem although it wasn’t until the next release that he was catapulted into the spotlight when his track “Technicolour” gained Radio One support from Annie Mac and Zane Lowe and was also used as a sound bed for Barack Obama’s victory speech on Radio One! Following this came a slew of singles and EPs with notable releases including the sci-fi inspired “Between Worlds EP” (Viper, 2011) and most recently the smash hit “Freefall” (Viper, 2012) as well as remixes of Prydz, John B, Camo & Krooked, Ayah Marar, Rockwell, DJ Fresh, Dirtyphonics and many more.

With his recent signing to Hospital, we are all very excited about the future for Metrik. Stay tuned.
