Detralate are a five piece melodic death metal band from Redditch, West Midlands. One reviewer described Detralate as 'fast, furious, melodic death metal with a distinctly Egyptian/Middle Eastern vibe'. 

"Where Detralate manage to stand out is by blending the technical wizardry and furious pacing of Nile’s more brutal moments (and believe me, the technical ability of the musicians is beyond reproach – some of the soloing throughout this EP made me want to give up playing) with a more accessible, melodic edge reminiscent of 90s Swedish melodic death metal like early In Flames and Dark Tranquillity."
