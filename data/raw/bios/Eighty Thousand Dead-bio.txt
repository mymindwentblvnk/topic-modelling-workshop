In early 2007, Eighty Thousand Dead formed with the idea of creating unique and pulverizing Death Metal that respectively represented the old school (i.e. Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation, Deicide) while utilizing a new, more technical, style (i.e. Origin, Necrophagist, Defeated Sanity). 

Beginning with guitarists Lee Mullis and Justin Nemeth, Eighty Thousand Dead’s original lineup quickly began playing as many shows as their High School scheduling would allow. After graduating in the middle of Midwestern Amish country (Middlebury, Indiana), and recording a locally spread EP, shortly followed by a two song demo, changes were soon made to accommodate their matured ideas. With a new solid lineup; including a new vocalist and drummer, Eighty Thousand Dead recorded a third demo release and has been continuously writing, playing shows, and touring. 

With an unrelenting drive, Eighty Thousand Dead’s mindset has always been to push until their musical demands are met and exceeded. Having experienced the restless life of the road, the dedication to unified ambitions has grown even stronger. Looking forward to the completion of a full length and a constant tour schedule, 2010 is shaping up to be an eventful year for the band and its following.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eighty+Thousand+Dead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
