Murderous Instinct is a Scottish death metal band from Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire. Formed in 2010, the group was founded by Ian Brown & Mark Cross. The band consists of four members: (Vocals), James Buchan (Drums), Pedro Arsenio (Guitars) and Mark Cross (Bass).
 
Murderous Instinct roots are in Fraserburgh, around January 2007 when guitarist Pedro Arsenio started a band named Ammonia. The lineup was made up of friends Rui Silva and Sidonio Brissos who shared ideas via the internet. Pedro Arsenio met Mark Cross through the local music scene and not long after they met, Mark Cross invited Pedro Arsenio (guitars) and Ian Brown (vocals) to start a new line up which included the drummer Cameron Shearer "Ted" bringing their lineup to four members. Due to health problems, in August 2011 Ian Brown decided to leave the band opening the slot to their new vocalist.
 
All Murderous Instinct members are experienced musicians from bands such as  Sculpture (formerly "Before The Rain" now) and Walking Wounded. Murderous Instinct are known by their brutal and deep sound, aggressive music style and their energetic live shows. On November 2010, the band self-recorded and self-released their debut 3 songs EP "Gringa".
Murderous Instinct received a small amount of airplay on radio stations off the back of the demo which led to the interest of the record label Xatanica to distribute the EP.
 
The band will return to the studio in November 2011 to work on the debut album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Murderous+Instinct">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
