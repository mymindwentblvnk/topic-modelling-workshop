There appear to be at least two artists named Loftus:
1. Loftus was a Chicago-based experimental alt-country post-rock band featuring members of Califone, Red Red Meat, Rex, and Pullman.

2. Loftus is a band that started in Souther California and let the five members on a tour of some of the United States and much of Europe. Loftus brings you a blend of noise and harmony that can only be described as organized chaos. For fans of Daughters (ever wonder where Daughters got their sound?  look no further...), The Locust and Converge. On the 10-track Hugs + Drugs, piledriven riffs and unrelenting screams are commonplace, yet when woven inside the heavy melodies found on "Bottoms Up" and "Gimme Greens", unleashed are the lethal forms of aural violence that heavy music fans have grown fond of. Unfortunately the band is no more, with even worse news of the passing of the beautiful and always amazing singer. RIP
