KAER MORHEN, the band came into being on August 1st, 1994. The first line-up consisted of Maciej "Strzelba" Strzeliński (electric guitar), Łukasz "Peter" Pietras (drums), Dawid "Świnas" Szczygłowski (vocals) and Marcin "Kuciapa" Sutkiewicz (bass guitar). It all started in the common room of the local garden plots. After about a month, we ended up in the Community Centre in Chodzież. Our way wasn't all roses, we've had many problems with ourselves and people around us. We've learned, what it means to be at the mercy of somebody and we know how bitter does swallowed pride taste like. Our line-up changed every month. So many people have come and go through Kaer Morhen, that there is no way to name them all - we don't remember all the names, but it made about fifty people altogether. We've had our highs and lows, but the band never ceased to exist. There were times that the band consisted of one person only. But the past ten years gave us all an amazing, rock'n'roll ride - it was fun and full of exciting adventures. It gave us a capital of experience and acquaintances that still keeps on paying dividends.

- We were into heavy metal since 1994, but it took quite a while before the music that we were playing, started resembling this noble genre. (Świnas)

- With Świnas, we understood each other almost instantly. We like the same things. I remember that unemployment was the thing that actually made us play together again. It's amazing, what a man can come up with when he's bored. (Strzelba) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kaer+Morhen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
