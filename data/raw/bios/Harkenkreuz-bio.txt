Mysterious thrash metal act from Japan. There's not much information about this band available, except the fact that Hisayoshi from Rosenfeld was involved and that they were linked to his label, named Skull Crusher Records. Harkenkreuz recorded the "Horstwessel" demo tape in August 1994, which got re-released with proper mastering by Skull Crusher Records. In September that year, the band appeared on the "Black Box - Peel Sessions" VHS with two songs: "Flag of the Red Death" and "Horstwessel". Harkenkreuz then appeared on the "Emergency Express 1995 - The Strange Boutique" omnibus album, released in 1995, with the track "SS Psycho". Although some band members wore nazi outfits during live performances, they actually did this for extra shock value, just like Rommel, Rosenfeld, etc. According to some sources, Harkenkreuz changed their name later to Grudge Curse and released an album named "Insanity Brain" in 1996 on Skull Crusher Records. Their current status is unknown. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Harkenkreuz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
