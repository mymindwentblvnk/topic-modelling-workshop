KlubiKirves was formed in early autumn 2006 when Leo and Juho started to play music together. They played hockey in the same team and noted that they are both interested in playing metal music. At the beginning Leo and Juho played covers together, but quickly they started to write their own songs and invented the name: KlubiKirves. November 2006 Juho and Leo realized that a rockband without a bass player is not a real rockband at all. Then Leo asked his younger brother Kalle to join the band. Kalle hesitated for a while, but finally joined KlubiKirves. He has been happy for his decision since that and the current line-up of KlubiKirves was born. After Juho, Leo and Kalle had played together for some six months they were ready for their first gig. June 1st 2007 at Torpparinmäki youth center KlubiKirves played their first show. Soon after that KlubiKirves made their fist demo. The demo got name ‘’KK Under You’’ and that is why KlubiKirves is often called the KK. Late 2007 KlubiKirves got a note about the Emergenza Festival 2008. The band got excited about the festival and signed in. The first round was at the Semifinal club. Because that was a 18+ club, KK had to leave the club right after the gig. Few hours later Leo..s and Kalle..s father called and told that KlubiKirves will take part in the 2nd round at Gloria. Right after that Juho and the brothers realized that they have a good chance to get to the finals at Nosturi. At Gloria they played a cool gig and late that night Björn -the host of Emergenza Finland - came to the stage and told that KK will show up at the final. Finally the final show came and every possible fan was present. After all performances late at night it was time to publish the three best bands. After a long wait Björn announced that KlubiKirves was placed 2nd in Emergenza Finland! Since that day every teenager in northern Helsinki has known what is KlubiKirves! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/KlubiKirves">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
