Moonlore is s newly created project and collaborative spiritual effort based in the mountains of Appalachia.
After years of travel, inspiration, planning, and circumstantial tempests, these sounds have finally broken free from a womb of sorts, after having endured a long process of growth.

The very nature of Moonlore is composed of diverse themes, filtered through a strict, ideological musical vessel. It features the voices of instruments native to the region, as well as those more exotic in nature. The paradigms of time and borders are of no consequence to the sounds conveyed. The grandiose and bombastic messages given to us by our surroundings and our thoughts, and our convictions are our 'raison d'etre' - our collective nagging subconscious being a surrogate parent, of sorts, to the sounds we eventually conceive.

'Reprisal of Streamwatcher' is to act as the d√©but appearance of this project on the radar; its message is personal in nature, and its sound is unrefined. Whether or not more is added or subtracted to this passage is uncertain, yet it is of no matter. Let this song be indicative of our message and what have come to do.
