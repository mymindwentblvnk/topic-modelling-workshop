The Copenhagen four piece Electric Hellride delivers groovy and direct metal with elements of thrash, death, sludge and traditional heavy metal.

The bands history goes back to 2008 and includes several intense concerts which in 2012 resulted in the band being chosen to represent Denmark at Wacken Open Air in the international finals of the Metal Battle.

After the critically acclaimed EP “Charged” from 2010 the band recorded a debut full length album in the autumn of 2011. The result is ten groovy tracks.

The album is called “Hate.Control.Manipulate” and was engineered, mixed and mastered by Jacob Bredahl (Hatesphere, The Kandidate) in Dead Rat Studio. The outcome is a dirty, ferocious and unpolished sound which still appears crisp and detailed. The energy and attitude the band delivers in concert is preserved on the equally energetic 47 minute album.

In August 2012 the band signed a deal with MIGHTY MUSIC and the label releases the album the November 26, 2012. Have a listen to a track from the album here: http://soundcloud.com/electric-hellride/hatred-propaganda or listen to it all on Spotify, Wimp or other streaming sources.

Artwork for the upcoming album was by Mircea Eftemie (Mnemic) who has worked for Soilwork, ALooP and The Haunted as well.
