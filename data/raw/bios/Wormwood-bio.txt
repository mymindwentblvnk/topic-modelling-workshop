Wormwood is a Melodic Black Metal from Stockholm, Sweden. They released their first EP in March 2015 categorized by a combination of abrasive vocals and harmonic backing vocals with an emphasis on Rock n Roll riffs and melody, but have since transitioned to an atmospheric and cinematic melodic black metal style. Their first album, Ghostlands (2017) was a mix of Folk, Black, Melodic, and Atmospheric black 'n' roll, leaning heavily into the folk elements. Since then, they have allowed the folk elements to take a step into the background, and have developed a sound that incorporates all of their influences, and adding some Blue influences in their guitarwork. Culminating in the fan favourite Nattarvet in 2019, and their most recent release, Arkivet in 2021. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wormwood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
