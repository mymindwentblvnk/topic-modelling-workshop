Seydr was born in the Landes (south west of france) in 2009. It originated from a desire to create a world in which powerful riffs of death metal and synthetic tones of the industrial could meet intense melodies.
The first EP from the band « Every cloud has a silver lining » is the best example, it depicts a cold and hostile world where hope is looming on the horizon. It is the fruit of much work out of stage which has lead to the recording and the mixing of the song at the BUD RECORDS studio with Mathieu PASCAL (GOROD) in Bordeaux.
Since the release of « Every cloud has a silver lining » (free download available at www.seydr.bandcamp.com ) at the beginning of 2011, the group has been going from concert to concert to share its music live.
