Adrenaline Mob is a band featuring former Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy, Symphony X frontman Russell Allen, guitar virtuoso Mike Orlando (Sonic Stomp), bassist Paul DiLeo and Stuck Mojo/Fozzy axeman Rich Ward. The Hit The Wall Songfacts reports that Adrenaline Mob's first live performance was on June 24, 2011 at the Hiro Ballroom in New York City and they released a YouTube video of a cover version of Black Sabbath 's "The Mob Rules " three days later. Their self-titled and self-produced debut EP was released on August 9, 2011. The band  has posted audio samples from its upcoming debut album on their Facebook page. John Moyer (Disturbed) joined the band in 2012 as the new bassist after DiLeo and Ward left.

In a March 2011 interview, Russell described ADRENALINE MOB as "a straight-up rock band with just rock songs — kind of like an edgy, modern kind of sound. It's not progressive or trying to be too metal or anything — it's just good, old crunchy rock stuff." He added, "I think it will be really well received by people who like to hear that kind of stuff. This is a new thing for Portnoy and myself, too. I've always done kind of done stuff with AYREON, but that's more of a vintage-y vibe, but nothing like this, which is kind of modern-sounding, almost like ROB ZOMBIE meets BLACK LABEL SOCIETY meets DISTURBED, [but] with [Ronnie James] Dio singing. It's all this kind of craziness. So it's definitely different and it's cool." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Adrenaline+Mob">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
