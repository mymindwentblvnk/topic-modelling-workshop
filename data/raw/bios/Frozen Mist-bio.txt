Frozen Mist was born in in February 2004 after I, Darkj, was outside smoking a cigarette in the cold, grim, snowy weather. Frozen Mist started as a solo project and has then evolved thru the years, changing styles with different varying and unique dark metal attributes. To this day, Frozen Mist remains as the ONLY extreme metal band in Lycoming County, PA.
