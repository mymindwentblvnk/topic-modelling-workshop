Soulthorn is a Hungarian black metal project, formed in 2007. Their themes are heavily influenced by the paranormal, the matter of death and the issues of human life. Musically, the initial intentions were to play old school black metal, in the vein of the legends of the genre, such as Mayhem, Tormentor and Darkthrone.

Soulthorn had worked as a one-man band for three years. In April 2010, Vorst joined as the vocalist. They have released their first demo in September 2010 with the title 'Embertörmelék'.
