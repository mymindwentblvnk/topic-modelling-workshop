CARNEIA is an experimental band that combines thoughtful riffs, dynamical playing, a variety of rhythmic styles, instrumental improvisation and powerful vocal lines. All of that creates an intense and eclectic sound that incorporates several musical genres going from alternative rock to progressive metal. 

In september 2008 their first Full length, ‘White Coma Light’, was released on "Offerandum Records" and received unanimously positive reviews from national and international music critics: 

'...These Belgians are simply bursting with alternative metal potential!...' (lordsofmetal.nl)

'...Gute Mischung und weltklasse Prog-Metal Songs – die bewegen... “White Coma Light” hört sich wie ein Best-Of von bei-Tool-verschwunden-Songs an... Ganz große Scheibe, mit sagenhafter Tiefe und atmosphärischen Parts die sich hören lassen können...' (burntobealive.de)

'...A great Debut album from a Upcoming band...' (metallinks.nl)

'...The debut album of the Belgian band Carneia is very close to the old sound of Tool but does it with such good quality that I’ll forgive them for it. The quintet is ridden in dynamical playing and the seven songs have a subdued tension in them...' (asice.net)

'...it’s a good thing we got it before the turning of the year, because otherwize I wouldn’t have been able to insert White Coma Light into that “Best Albums Of 2008”-list of mine.' (Concrete Web)

After teaming up on stage with bands such as Amenra, Cloon, Maudlin, Sardonis, Bulls on Parade, Black Heart Rebellion, Toman, …, Carneia decided to lock themselves up in their rehearsal room and to write new songs. The result is a worthy successor, the second full length “All Tongues of Babel”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carneia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
