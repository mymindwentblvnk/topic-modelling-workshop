“We always knew this was a special record, but the fans’ connection with its message and meaning has given it a life of its own in many ways. It really is a record that refuses to go away.” Above & Beyond’s Tony McGuinness
Propelled by two of the biggest DJs in global dance music, Above & Beyond and Gareth Emery pres. OceanLab ‘On A Good Day (Metropolis)’ is a people’s record in the truest sense of the phrase.

With over 2.5 million views on YouTube and mainstream support from Radio 1’s Scott Mills, the euphoric club track even inspired a singalong more in keeping with a U2 concert than a club set at this year’s Global Gathering festival: http://bit.ly/9tlqY9.
OceanLab’s ‘On A Good Day’ originally featured on the 2008 LP ‘Sirens Of The Sea’, an album that reached #1 in the US iTunes dance chart, and was lauded in respected publications such as Mixmag and DJ Magazine.

‘On A Good Day’ remained a firm favourite in the sets of Above & Beyond – eventually receiving another lease of life when its vocals were married with Gareth Emery’s ‘Metropolis’ as a DJ bootleg by Hungarian duo Myon & Shane 54.

After picking up mainstream radio support from Radio 1, ‘On A Good Day (Metropolis)’ is now being released alongside a drum & bass rework from scene stalwarts J Majik and Wickaman (known for their uplifting, club-smashing remix of Deadmau5’s chart hit ‘I Remember’), which has already been hammered by Andy C, Chrissy Chris (1 Xtra), Radio 1’s Grooverider, Hype, Judge Jules and Adam F. A previously unreleased acoustic version will feature as iTunes exclusive track.

Tapping into the vocal’s narrative of triumph over adversity, the official music video centres on the story of Detroit’s Georgia Street Community Collective, and their drive to regenerate the derelict buildings and industrial graveyards of Detroit and transform them into urban farms and community gardens. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Above+&+Beyond+&+Gareth+Emery+pres.+OceanLab">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
