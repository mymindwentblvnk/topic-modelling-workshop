Since the 1990 release of their debut Toxic Wasteland, DOFKA has generated what might be described as a cult following, particularly among metal guitar aficionados. The guitar acrobatics of Jim Dofka became a major part of the bandâ€™s signature sound. After several lineup changes and several long hiatuses while other projects came to the fore, DOFKA is back with a fresh lineup, a new CD and a fierce attitude.

2010 has seen the release of Humanity Bleak, a new full length offering that focuses less on balls-out guitar shredding more on musical craftsmanship, intelligent songwriting and lyrical depth. Framed in a pristinely produced backdrop, the album is a masterful showing of old school influence carried into the realm of modern metal. Humanity Bleak promises to stand on its own as an important contribution to the metal community. True Metal.
