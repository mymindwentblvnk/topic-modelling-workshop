Calgary DOOM Infinite Grievance. A band that started out as just a name has evolved into what you hear today. After many trials and failures to get the project going and keep it afloat, the official incarnation of Infinite Grievance has come to be.

We had noticed that there was an unsettling lack of DOOM metal bands in the city and province. We have made it a point to change that and bring the sonic assault and skull crushing ways of DOOM to the metal loving public.

With lyrics spanning hatred, depression, loneliness, disgust in humanity, religion and greed, among other subjects, Infinite Grievance has next to no borders to be kept isolated within. Our only rule is to keep it HEAVY.

We plan to follow through with that until the end, whenever that may be.

If you enjoyed our music, feel free to add us!
