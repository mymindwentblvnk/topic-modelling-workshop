SBTRKT is Aaron Jerome, a producer based in London. He performs behind a mask every time he plays out.  

5 things about SBTRKT:
1) His live show includes his main collaborator Sampha on vocals and keyboards.
2) The name came about to create a musical identity separate from any single person.
3) Much of the music being played is electronic based but some recent material is live.
4) First gig was at fabric in Room 1 at Get Familiar.
5) SBTRKT is pronouced 'Subtract'.

Having wrapped up remixes for Basement Jaxx (‘Scars’) and Franz Ferdinand (‘Send Him Away’), he’s got the airwaves in a stir with Benji B, Mary Anne Hobbs and Gilles Peterson singing his praises. With releases on the equally anonymous Brainmath label, Ramp and the ever fun Young Turks[i/].
