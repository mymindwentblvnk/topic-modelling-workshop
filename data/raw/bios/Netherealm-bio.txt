Formed in 2007 in Wodonga, Victoria. A primarily thrash metal band but music explores various elements of rock, hardcore, death and black metal. All members are of vast playing experience and deliver a solid, energetic , fast-paced and fun live set. Songs are to-the-point and structured, and contain many flavours and elements – lots of harmonized guitar, thrash riffs and beats, death-metal blast beats, “punch the air” rock grooves, guitar solos and a thundering bass sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Netherealm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
