Multiple Artists exist with the name Loona:

1) LOONA, stylized as LOOΠΔ (Hangul: 이달의 소녀; lit. Girl of the Month) is a 12-member South Korean girl group under BlockBerryCreative, a subsidiary of Polaris Entertainment.

Each individual member released a single album up until the group's official debut. A new member was introduced each month. Prior to debuting, the members also promoted in sub-units, each with their own defined concept.

On August 7, 2018, after an eighteen-month-long project to introduce the individual members, BlockBerryCreative released "favOriTe" as a pre-release to their upcoming debut album. A week later, on August 15, the tracklist for the album was released and the album was scheduled for August 20. The album was released as [+ +] and the title track chosen for the mini was "Hi High". The mini was positively received, selling over 50,000 copies, the second-best-selling album by a debuting girl group that year, and debuting at #2 on the Gaon Album Chart.
