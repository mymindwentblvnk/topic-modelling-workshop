Licorea was founded in 2002. The basic line-up crystallized in 2004. It is a band of outcasts from well-known Warsaw bands, i.e. Rootwater and Indukti. They have one thing in common: though they thought themselves the mainstay of their former bands, it was only after expelling them mentioned bands did set out on the road to progress, fame and commercial success. They are old, bitter and unpleasant, playing bitter and unpleasant music, with an overtone of longing for the days past. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Licorea">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
