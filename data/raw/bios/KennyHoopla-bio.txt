Kenneth La’ron, known professionally as KennyHoopla, is an American recording artist and songwriter. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, he grew up absorbing a diverse spread of music and art—The Drums, Funeral Suits, Common and Teen Suicide are credited as some of his greatest influences. His catalog is intimate, thoughtful, and self-labeled ‘new wave nostalgia,’ his songs soaked in both the warmths and the darknesses of life and love.

He’s performed alongside Injury Reserve, Jack Harlow, Omar Apollo, Trapo, Yung Gravy and Alex Wiley, and toured with Yoshi Flower in February 2019. “Lost Cause” is Kenny’s breakout single, which has been listed on Spotify’s “Fresh Finds”, “Alternative R&B”and “Anti-Pop” playlists. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/kennyhoopla">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
