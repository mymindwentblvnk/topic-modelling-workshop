New jersey based deathcore

Formed in 2006, having undergone several lineup changes over the years. The band still holds its 3 original members Marco Carrasco, Mike Newman and Jimmy Allan. Current Releases: their first EP titled "to document the deceased" and there follow up 2008 demo. Influenced by a variety of heavy and technical death metal bands, At Rest pushes for a unique and heavy sound of their own. Straying far from overdone palm-muted breakdowns and boring sweeping patterns, At Rest brings real solos, creative breakdowns and catchy riffs. The band is now back together.
