'Eno' is a name used by at least three musical performers:

1. "Eno was the original stage-name of experimental musician Brian Eno prior to the release of the Discreet Music album. Eno studied at art school, taking inspiration from minimalist painting, but he had little musical education or playing experience when he joined the band Roxy Music as their keyboards and synthesisers player in the early 1970s. Roxy Music's success in the glam rock scene came quickly, but Eno soon tired of touring, and he left the group after the release of For Your Pleasure (1973), beginning his solo career with Here Come the Warm Jets (1973) and Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) (1974). Eno extended his reach into more experimental musical styles with (No Pussyfooting) (1973), a collaboration with Robert Fripp, Another Green World (1975) and Before and after Science (1977). 

2. Eno is a duo from Switzerland] consisting of drummer Ivo Münger and guitarist Christian Mikolasek, and for just a duo they make a whole lot of music at the same point of time!

Inspired by bands like MONO, Gregor Samsa and Mogwai, these two Swiss guys decided to start a journey into wider soundscapes. As the duo uses loopstations and samples and guitars, the emotional and cleverly structured songs, all of them instrumental, sound like a whole orchestra.

3. "Eno is an artist and musician operating out of New York City. Somehow, he has managed to blend alternative, electronica, new-age, and indie in to a single, poingantly-direct package. Nature Vs Industry (remastered by Endless Field Studios’ own Arthur Zdrinc) is nothing short of magic. Full of guest musicians, artists, and songwriters it’s the perfect companion on a rainy day in the park or wandering the lighted streets of our innumerable cities." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eno">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
