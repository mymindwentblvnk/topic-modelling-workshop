RSS Disco is a three-piece electronic music and DJ collective from Hamburg, Germany.

The trio, who learned to dance to electronic music in Hamburg, stand for synthesizer disco, acid-dripping house and psychedelic techno like few other electronic musicians. They now play big indie festivals as well as Ibiza, dark clubs as well as small dusty dancefloors by lakes. They release mixes for Dublab Radio in Los Angeles, ARTE Concert, or The Lot Radio from New York. Their live recordings or remixes for Tomemitsu, Keshavara, Rupa or Fotos have hundreds of thousands of clicks. 

Off the dance floor they also keep busy, running their Label Mireia Records with releases by artists like Johannes Klingebiel, Tomemitsu, Das Komplex, Johannes Klingebiel, Jacques Bon, Zombies in Miami, Casino Times or Lauer and Erobique. The label’s aesthetic is grounded in DIY design principles: vinyl records are mostly screen printed, stamped and often become sought after limited editions.

RSS Disco's début album, Mooncake, came out in September 2022. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/RSS+Disco">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
