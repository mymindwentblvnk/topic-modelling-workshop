Three Times Dope (a.k.a. 3XDope) is a hip-hop trio from Philadelphia consisting of EST (Robert Waller), Walter Griggs and Duerwood Beale. Their debut LP, Original Stylin was well-received, though the follow-up was a comparative failure (Live from Acknikulous Land, 1990). Their third album, Da Sequel, was released in 1998. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Three+Times+Dope">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
