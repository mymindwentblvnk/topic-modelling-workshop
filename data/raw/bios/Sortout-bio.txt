"ARISE. SORT OUT. OVERCOME.​
Sortout. Creating moments. Defining live music." 
The band’s name stands for the ups and downs they have gone through and never to stop before you sorted everything out.

There was a time of farewells, retreats and new beginnings. Line-up changes became a part of the progress of the band. Most of this now belongs to history, but the memories made with great shows and bands such as Machine Head, Trivium, Bullet for my Valentine, Amon Amarth, etc. are going to stay forever. Since 2018 a lot has changed.

With Michael Geuze (Guitars) and André Hammerer (Drums) the new musical basis, and with founding member Benjamin Herter the new lyrical basis has been found. With Aaron Schedler (Guitars) and Günter Meusburger (Bass) another two creative minds joined. Together they are now specifying ideas, structures and arrangements and keep on constantly working for their ideas to become reality.

Music is passion - passion is to live in the moment. Sortout creates moments.

Their musical style could be roughly described as metalcore, but the sound has a lot more different aspects in it. It is the result of various musical backgrounds of each of the members which is defining Sortout today. With marching drums, knife-edged guitar riffs, forceful shouts and catchy clean vocals, they create their very own, exceptional and unmistakable sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sortout">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
