Blackland is the main project of Michael Balch. (some tracks were also co-written by a Tom Ferris). Since Michael never got a satisfying offer for a record deal, Blackland have only released some songs on compilations. Blackland so far have only done a full length album (Unification) and an EP (Relevance), with the songs spread out on various releases. These 2 "Releases" were done in the time around 1992-95. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blackland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
