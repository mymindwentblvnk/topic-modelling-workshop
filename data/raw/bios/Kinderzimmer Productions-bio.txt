Kinderzimmer Productions is a German hip hop band from Ulm (in the jargon of the band "U-Stadt"), a town not normally known for hip hop. They consisted of Quasi Modo (Sascha Klammt as DJ) and Textor (Henrik von Holtum as MC). They released their first album in 1994. Their name is both a tribute to early hip hop group Boogie Down Productions and a reference to the child's play room (German Kinderzimmer) in the parental house of Henrik von Holtum, in which the first two albums were recorded. The group officially announced their split in 2008. The duo reformed in 2019 and released their comeback album "Todesverachtung to go" on January 17th, 2020.

Kinderzimmer Productions is distinguished by a highly individual style. More than with most German-language hip hop, the tracks are shaped by a dynamic combination of samples (often jazzy or funky, frequently quoting well-known hip hop classics), which creates a constant change of mood. Textor's sing-speak is marked by high speed, complicated sentence constructions and the occasional use of foreign words and technical terms, which can sometimes make his message seem self-confident and obscure, although the content is of secondary importance to the sophisticated wordplay. In "Back" Textor sings: "Wie ich schon sagte, ich schreib meine Zeilen mal widerlich schnell, mal fettig und langsam, mal sinnvoll, mal sinnlos" ("Like I said, sometimes I write my lines obscenely fast, sometimes slow and flabby, sometimes meaningful, sometimes meaningless"). This mixture of sampling and sing-speak can be psychedelic in effect.

As a special feature on their homepage, users can make their own hip hop tape with words spoken by Textor.
