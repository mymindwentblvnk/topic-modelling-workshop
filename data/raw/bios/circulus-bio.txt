Circulus are a psychedelic folk/progressive rock band from South London, England, put together by vocalist and songwriter Michael Tyack. Circulus believe that high-life is actually medieval life. This is reflected in their varied work, which they describe as "hurtful to people's ears."

The band uses a mix of modern and medieval instruments, such as the lute, bongos and the modern bass and electric guitars. They claim to believe in fairies and pixies.
