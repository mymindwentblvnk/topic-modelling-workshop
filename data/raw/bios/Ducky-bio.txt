Ducky is a west coast native in a current New York state of mind; she is currently a student of the Clive Davis Program at NYUâ€™s Tisch, where she is majoring in recorded music. Her career started at 14 when she released her first album, Low Frequency Days (available on iTunes), and continued with two more albums (The Automobile, The Dreamland Series) and an EP (Weekdays EP), live performances, and a foray into DJing that proved successful in the San Francisco scene, as her alter-ego DJ Fidget. Today Ducky lives as a student, contradicting the lazy artist duck aesthetic as she commits every waking moment to both her studies and her music career. You may find her strolling through Washington Square park, eating cheap in the lower east side, or paddling and preening her feathers in the local pond. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ducky">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
