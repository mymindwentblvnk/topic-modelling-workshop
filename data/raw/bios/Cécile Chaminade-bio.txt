Cécile Louise Stéphanie Chaminade (1857-1944). "Chaminade was only eight years old when Bizet declared that she was 'destined for a brilliant career.' She soon started performing her own compositions in her native Paris, and her exceptional piano skills won acclaim from both critics and public alike. She started to make regular tours abroad, residing permanently in her home in Monte Carlo. Though a gifted and versatile composer, Chaminade is perhaps best remembered for her short piano pieces, which, if lacking in depth, still have a charm that is elegantly conveyed - it is salon music at its best." Chaminade has also composed for the flute and piano.
