Oberhofer started in 2008 as the recording project of Brad Oberhofer. After moving from his native Tacoma, Washington to New York City, Oberhofer attended New York University to study music composition.[1] In the style of Jon Bon Jovi, the young singer adopted his own name as the title of the project. Although the band has since gone through various lineup formations, the name has remained the same because Oberhofer writes and records all the music himself.[2]
In 2010, Oberhofer self-released his first single o0Oo0O0o and was soon asked to go on tour with bands like Sleigh Bells, Neon Indian, and The Morning Benders.[1] After hitting the road for a year, Oberhofer released Away Frm U and I Could Go in 2011. The two singles brought the attention of independent label White Iris Records who released the band's next single Gotta Go/Mahwun in the summer of 2011. Soon after, Oberhofer signed with Glassnote Records to release their debut album.[3] Stereogum ranked the band as the No. 39 most anticipated album of 2012.[4]
Brad began work on Time Capsules II in the studio with Grammy Award winning producer Steve Lillywhite in November 2011, recording vocals and most instrumental tracks himself, and pulling in bandmates and other instrumentalists to complete certain tracks. Glassnote released Time Capsules II on in the United States on March 27, 2012.[5] In anticipation for the release, the band performed "Away Frm U" on the Late Show with David Letterman.[6]
Oberhofer performed widely in clubs and on the festival circuit in support of Time Capsules II. Recent notable performances include in the Mojave Tent at the 2012 edition of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.[7] and the Budweiser stage at Lollapalooza in Chicago on August 5, 2012,.[8] They are scheduled to perform at the Austin City Limits Music Festival on October 13.[9]
