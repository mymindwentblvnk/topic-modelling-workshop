Sea of Nectar is a progressive metal band (often described as depressive dark metal) originally from Caracas, Vzla. Their music strictly focuses on a old-school death metal sound blended with melodic and progressive music all the while keeping its dark elements. Their lyrics reflect diverse moods that go from dark emotive themes all the way to empathy and melancholy.

Sea of Nectar includes members of several bands including Spellforest, Hiedra, Dismal Dawn, Leaves, Distrust, Sleepless and Mojo Pojo subsequently. The band recorded their first self-produced album “Paramounts” at S.O.D. and AudioLine Studios and it was mixed by Fepo Gruber in 2002 and therefore released by Melomaniac Productions/Ad Astra during the following year.

The band’s official website is still under construction.
