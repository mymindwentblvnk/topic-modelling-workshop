(Note: If you're looking for the 1960's R&B band featuring Duane Allman, you need The Hour Glass)

The truth is that THE HOURGLASS has never been a band. We didn’t have concerts or singles. I used to play with Bahij (drums) in our practice place from time to time in Homs and the songs were mixture between covers and originals. 

 

Then in late 2002, I decided to write lyrics after I gave up for the idea of having someone to help me in that. And it worked! Actually I discovered talents that I thought I didn’t have at all. I used to write short stories but lyrics? Never!

 

Musically at that time I had like tons of riffs and solos in my head and on tapes I worked on the songs till the end of the year and started searching for a vocalist to sing them after they were nearly complete.

 

That was a big big problem for me. Our style is 80’s traditional Metal and the songs are like MAIDEN and SAVATAGE a lot. I know that Basem has a voice and singing style like Bruce but I never knew him in person at that time. I used to know a guy called Gary he sings with a Lebanese band called DILEMMA, I called him and invited him to test our songs. He is a very good vocalist but his voice is more suitable for Power Metal, STRATOVARIUS and HAMMERFALL style, so I asked him to introduce me to Basem. We played with Basem and the main members of the band are formed.

 

The bass guitar problem was saved by Salim from SOLITAIRE (Lebanon), we used to play a long time ago together in a cover band called NEO BLOOD in Lebanon.

Because of time variable, I recorded a lot of the bass on the album.

The keyboard was played by Nareg of a cover band in Aleppo called JUST PAIN, he is brilliant, we recorded them in half a day, I like his solos at the end on “The Land Of The Free”, they are magical.
