For Today was a metalcore band from Sioux City, Iowa, United States, active from 2005 to 2016. For Today will stop at nothing until the name of Christ is proclaimed to the entire world. "Unrelenting" is a word to describe the music: hardcore-influenced metal that combines melodic sweeps with breakdowns.

Their third full length was announced on May 26, 2010, via their official MySpace blog. Breaker was released on August 31, 2010, and was their most successful album to date. It was recorded in New Jersey with Will Putney and includes guest vocals by Drew Dijorio (Stray From The Path), Shane Raymond (Close Your Eyes) and Jay Pepito (Reign Supreme).
