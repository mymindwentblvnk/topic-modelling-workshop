Spinvis is Erik de Jong, a Dutchman living in the suburban jungle of Nieuwegein, The Netherlands. A veteran of the Utrecht punk and indie scenes, he started recording as Spinvis in 2001. 2002 saw the release of his eponymous d√©but album, Spinvis, recorded in his attic with computers, samplers, musical instruments and other objects laying around. Most remarkable are his poetic lyrics, that are at times nonsensical and non-consecutive. 

His third album, Dagen van Gras, Dagen van Stro (Days of Grass, Days of Straw) was released in 2005. In August 2007 Goochelaars en geesten (Magicians and Ghosts) a collection of earlier work including B-sides, unpublished tracks and songs produced under assignment was released. 

In 2006 Spinvis teamed up with Simon Vinkenoog. Together they have released a new album, titled Spinvis Combo / Ja! (Yes!). In 2007 they  joined their performances in a festival act called Noga. 

The Popprijs 2006 was awarded to Spinvis at the Noorderslag Festival in Groningen, an award for artists who have made an important contribution to Dutch pop music.

In 2011, his new album Tot Ziens, Justine Keller came out, being well received by the audience. 2017 saw the release of Trein Vuur Dageraad and the 'Best of' album Omnibus, followed by a new studio album entitled 7.6.9.6. in 2020. In several interviews following the release of the album, De Jong announced a change of his musical course, the relatively abstract 2021 EP Sunon being the first example of it.
