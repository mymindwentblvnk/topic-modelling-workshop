"The Suicider" band was found at the beginning of 2005 in Korolev city (Moscow region), but the staff of the band, repertory and the style was formed only in winter 2006, when the band joined Kniaz Toshnotvor (vocals and guitar of "Stramoslyabs"). Sometimes the band calls itself the "Consort of suicidal-depressive-slacky-cynical metal". On the opinion of the vocalist, Suicider plays "suicide metal", but in general, it's more like a heavy gothic metal with a little tendency to the melodic death from time to time. The music of the group is a some sort of a tribute to a reposed band Sentenced, as evident from the name of the band. Plenty of fast riffs get mixed with accoustic parts, pure main vocal is rich of screams and growls, English-speaking texts are about the death and suicide, also strong sarcasm towards the suicide - and not only that is a Sucider! The music works of the band were inspired by such collectives: Sentenced, Amorphis, Children of Bodom, Norther, Paradise Lost, Katatonia and the others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Suicider">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
