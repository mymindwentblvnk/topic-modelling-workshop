Wortmord is a new, rising Thrash Metal band from Essen/Germany which was founded in March 2007 by Grave Violator (Peppi or just Josef Dominik), Chris and Menny. Grave Violator was infected by music again while recording Sodoms "The Final Sign of Evil". In 1984 he was the guitar player for Thrash legend Sodom.

Now the rest of the band had to be recruited. The singer of ANTON-B Paco was asked to be singer in the band. Out of the good work with the producer of Sodom's "The Final Sign Of Evil" -  Thorsten "Toto" Hain - who is also a very good guitar player the idea of working together in a band was born.

In late summer 2008 the band was thrown back: The singer Paco who got ill with multiple sclerosis had to give up singing in the band.

A new singer had to be found because the band didn't want to give up. Toto met an old friend again. On the 3rd January 2009 everything became clear after the first rehearsal with Uli Mentzel. He was the new singer of the band!

Wortmord were up for new actions again. Eine of the first live actions was the succesful gig on the "Chris Witchhunter tribute festival". During this gig the video recordings for the first clip "Willkommen im Club der lebenden Leichen" were shot.

The band has just finished the recordings of their first album "Wortgeburt" which will be released in September/October 2010 by Sunny Bastards Records.

In June 2010 Chris(toph Boltz) leaves the band and is replace by Ralf Schieritz (Die Knappen, Black Aces).

The band:
Uli Mentzel - Vocals
Grave Violator - Rhythym Guitar
Thorsten "Toto" Hain - Lead Guitar
Ralf Schieritz - Bass
Menny - Drums
