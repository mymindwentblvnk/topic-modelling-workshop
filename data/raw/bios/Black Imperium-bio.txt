Black Imperium started in October 13,2008 with the name "Lord Arknum". It was created as a one man project by Alex,until Esteroth joined as a vocalist in the beginning of 2010,then they changed their name to Black Imperium.  On February of 2010 they released their first song called "Ashes" which has a very raw riff.  On March of 2010 Esteroth was kicked out of the band due to not being responsible and not being hardworking,so they joined Dark Angel as the vocalist in which they released "A New World Order".  Ricarcass from the horror goregrind band Piel De Cadaver participated as the guest vocalist on "Infernal Saw",which was made with the same instrumental version as "Ashes".  On February of 2011,Alex decided to leave the band to take care of his personal life,so Esteroth is the owner now.  On that day they released the Demo which has their 3 first releases featuring;Alex,Esteroth,Dark Angel and Ricarcass. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Imperium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
