Founded in the Fall of 2005 in Kosice/Slovakia, Killchain are able to build up the new generation of death metal. They are young,talented, full of energy ande very enthusiasm by doing their work: celebrate excellent death metal in the spirit of bands such as Six Feet Under,Bolt Thrower,Vomitory and many others also done before. There also will be no doubt that these guys means it honest!!! On their One More Victim titled debut album, recorded and produced at the end of the year 2006 in Poprad, the four â€“ piece demonstrate that it is possible to celebrate death metal, in the classic sense, without being antiquated, frumpy or in worst case boring. One More Victim is wonderfully fresh and its playfulness is infectious and varied, without leaving the way in strange styles and genres. With this album the guys will build a solid base for their future an show potential for more!!! The album released in june 2007 by the german label Maintain Records. In 2007 Killchain played a lot of show with bands like Vader,Misery Index and European tour with Dementor (2008)... also a few bigger shows and festival in and around Slovakia. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Killchain">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
