Sauroctonos is a post-black metal band from Ukraine, formed in 2005.

After recording their unreleased album "All Turns To Ashes" in 2009 the band distinctly changes its style by experimenting with sound and adding elements of post-metal, acoustic guitars and electronics to their music.

The new album named "Our Cold Days Are Still Here When The Lights Are Out" appears to be the first official release of Sauroctonos, showing a new phase of the band and carrying the atmosphere of melancholy and nostalgie in itself. Its main ideological idea is expressing the indifference as the only right attitude to reality.

Album is out now in digital music stores.
CD release is scheduled for autumn 2012, by Arx Productions.

Line-up:

Nick Kushnir - guitars, vocals
Alexandr Mazurenko - bass guitar
Yuriy Kononov - drums
