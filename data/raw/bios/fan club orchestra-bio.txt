Laurent and Nicolas Baudoux have expanded the Scratch Pet Land project and given it a new name: the Fan Club Orchestra . In 1999, The Brothers Baudoux assembled ten friends and had them improvise on Game Boys, samplers, flutes, harmonicas, turntables, mouth harps, and god only knows what else, all under the direction of Laurent, who gave detailed instructions to the Orchestra via overhead projector. The music is improvised and edited down afterwards using the jam sessions as source material for the end product. There is also a Fan Club Orchestra Japan, started by an early participant in the Belgium chapter. He brought the communal noisemaking format back to his homeland, and FCOJ released a record of its own.
They released Sun Papi and the Fan Club Orchestra Vol. 1 & Vol. 2 and CD Is Future on Sonig.
