DJ Boring is the moniker of an Australian-born, London-based house producer who achieved viral success (and a degree of infamy) with his 2016 track "Winona." Characterized by its atmospheric synth pads, slightly jarring bass swoops, and most of all, a poignant sample of Winona Ryder recalling a casting director telling her she wasn't attractive enough to be an actress, the track was uploaded to YouTube in late September of that year, and quickly racked up hundreds of thousands of views. It probably didn't hurt that the Ryder-starring sci-fi/horror series Stranger Things had just become a major pop culture phenomenon that summer. All of a sudden, several journalists questioned the intentions of this unheard-of producer, as well as other ironically named, '90s-loving artists such as Ross from Friends and DJ Seinfeld, and lumped them together as part of a "lo-fi house" craze. Despite its detractors, the song gained an enthusiastic following, and was released on vinyl by E-Beamz at the close of the year. In 2017, Boring toured across the globe and released Sunday Avenue (LPH White) and Different Dates (Lost Palms). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Boring">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
