Sean Christopher is a lead singer of  Moonpilot - a band from Den Haag (Netherlands). 

Sean studied drums on the Royal Conservatory in the Netherlands. It was that period that he got inspired to actually write music, not only playing it. Sean, decided to give up his studies and focus on composing music.

His composition "Everything" was used in an Audi commercial and the amount of requests for the full song was so high that Sean created a long version. He released singles "Everything" and "Wasteland" and album "Transcendence" (feat. Andrew Sords)
