Mortuum - black metal band from Belgium. It all started back in July 2005. Sargathanas and Azaroth decided to start a new project after they've abandoned their other band "Excavate". Their search for other musicians was an easy task as Savnock, a bass player and another guitarplayer were found. The first rehearsals went very good and soon, in August  2005, their first songs were completed. The bassplayer and the second guitarplayer soon left the band because they didn't had the same ideas regarding Mortuum and the style of music. A new guiterplayer was found in Malphas in December 2005, the search for a bassplayer wasn't necessary. New songs were made and soon they were ready to terrorise the stages. In July 2006 they gave their first performance wich was a huge succes. Mantorok finaly joined the forces in August 2006, giving their music a new dimension, making it all more agressively. More songs were completed and more gigs were done.

In April 2007, Malphas was forced to leave the band. He didn't had the commitment anymore like he used to. Mortuum also started the recordings of their first full CD. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mortuum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
