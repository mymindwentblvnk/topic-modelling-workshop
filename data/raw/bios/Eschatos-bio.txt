Eschatos is a Latvian progressive black metal band from Rīga, Latvia, formed in 2012, known for their haunting live performances and unconventional approach to the genre. The lineup is composed of themselves proven musicians who have previously worked together in bands as Ocularis Infernum, Grondh, and Velna Krusti.

The band's debut album, Hierophanies, released in 2013, garnered significant critical acclaim for its unique sound. It was followed in 2015 by The Grand Noir.

"To truly understand what Eschatos is, look inside your own abyss. Look inside those things that make you feel condemned, uncomfortable and wary, things that make you raging mad and rabid, things that make you feel hateful. This is the fuel that burns the black flame of art that is Eschatos - untamed, lawless, pure and destructive."
