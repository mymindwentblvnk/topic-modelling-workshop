LION TWIN is a German metal-pop duo which was established in the early summer of 2011 by Li (vocals) and Jan (guitar). LION TWIN meld real metal with rock pop. Their Nashville album builds on the sound of 80s metal and weaves in today’s musical taste in the genre. Two big names from the rock scene add fire to the mix: Udo Dirkschneider (Accept and U.D.O.) sings a duet with Li on one song, and Michael Wagener (Alice Cooper, Megadeth, Accept, Mötley Crüe, Raven, Metallica, Janet Jackson, Queen, Ozzy Osbourne) mixed and mastered this debut album in his WireWorld Studio in Nashville. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lion+Twin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
