There are two bands with the name HB.

1) One is a Christian band from Forssa, Finland. Formed in 2002, they started playing rock but have since developed a more massive, heavy metal sound, with orchestral/symphonic backgrounds, and have always had a female lead vocalist. HB has grown to be one of the most popular Christian groups in Finland, and with their first English album Frozen Inside released in 2008, they've also had some attention from abroad.

Current line-up:
Johanna Aaltonen - vocals
Antti Niskala - keys, vocals
Samuel MÃ¤ki-Kerttula - drums
Tuomas Kannisto- bass
Sofia Ylinen - guitar
Bob - guitar

3) The other band called HB (Hard Black) is a Japanese instrumental post-rock band that was formed in December 2004 in Tokyo. They have released one mini-album called Hard Black on the 8th August 2007 with Zankyo records. 

The bands consists of three members (all female):
Maki999 - drums & glockenspiel
Muupy - didgeridoo, percussion & glockenspiel
Tucchie - upright bass

Their music features complex rhythm with bass and glockenspiel loops on top of 'polyrhythm' constructed by drums and percussion. Their live performance has been attracting a great deal of attention with a jam-based development fusing electronica, dub and minimalism, which is always thrilling and spontaneous. Their attempt to 'rhythm' never stops!!
