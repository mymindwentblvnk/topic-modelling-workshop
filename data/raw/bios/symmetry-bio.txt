Symmetry, an integral piece of the record label Italians Do It Better, is an instrumental electronic duo formed in 2010 by Johnny Jewel and Nat Walker, who are also members of the groups and . The duo’s synth-driven, atmospheric instrumentals rely on a classic, analogue aesthetic that sets their work apart from today's more software-driven composition style. Jewel and Walker kicked off their project with a pair of two lauded albums in 2011 — the then-limited run "The Messenger" and the two-hour "Themes For An Immaginary Film" both of which received high praise from fans and critics alike. Themes for an Imaginary Film was ranked as Gorilla Vs. Bear's 19th best album of 2012 (album was released in mid-December of 2011).

Songs from both albums have been featured in many films and television shows. Their hit song "The Hunt” is used as the main theme song for A&E’s television series "Those Who Kill", starring Chloe Sevigny. The series also prominently features several other Symmetry tracks.

The duo, along with other Italians Do It Better acts, is featured on the soundtrack to Ryan Gosling’s 2015 directorial debut, Lost River Original Motion Picture Score, which Jewel scored. Symmetry music has appeared in several films. In addition, the duo have performed live internationally at events for fashion brands such as Gucci, Armani, and Chanel. Symmetry is currently in the studio working on their much-anticipated album, Still Life. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Symmetry">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
