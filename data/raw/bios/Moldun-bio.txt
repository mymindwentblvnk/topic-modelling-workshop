MOLDUN was formed in 2009. In early 2010 the band went through some minor line-up changes and since then the current line-up has remained the same.

All members have been active in the Icelandic music scene for years and have gained both recognition and respect with their former bands.

In 2010 Moldun did a short tour in Denmark, and in 2011 they participated in the “Icelandic Invasion” tour in France, supporting bands such as L´esprit du Clan, Tagada Jones and Loudblast.

And now as they are getting ready to release their debut album, their top priority is world domination. And to get groupies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/moldun">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
