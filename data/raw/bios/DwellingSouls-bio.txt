DwellingSouls was started as a project in 2002 by ex-Einherjer and Thundra bassist Stein Sund. 
He soon got Thundra guitarist/vocalist Thor Erik Helgesen to do the vocals and guitars.
In 2003 they recorded a 3 track demo "The Embrace & The Awakening"

Thor Erik left the project to consentrate on his other two bands.
After this DwellingSouls was put on hold.In 2006 Stein Sund decided to reactivate DwellingSouls
He got a Thommy Fredriksen to do the vocals.
