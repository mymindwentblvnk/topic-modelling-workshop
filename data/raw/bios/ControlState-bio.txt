Controlstate is a metalcore band formed in Ypres, Belgium in 2007. The band originally consisted of Bram Vervisch, ex-singer of First Alliance and Blood Redemption (vocals), Servaas Dejaegher (guitar, vocals), Nicolas Herregat (guitar), Miguel Bouttry (bass) and Pieter Verholle (drums). 

In 2011, Miguel had to leave the bad due to starting his own company. He was temporarily replaced by Nick Vyvey (Rafflesia, ex-Blood Redemption). In 2012, Lucas Aerbeydt joined the band as the new bass player.

They have a 2-song demo running and one full length album called 'The Powerhouse', which is downloadable for free on their website. In 2013, they released a new 3-song promo in preparation of a new full length release in 2014.
