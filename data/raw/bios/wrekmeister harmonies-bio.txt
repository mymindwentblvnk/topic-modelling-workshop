Wrekmeister Harmonies, led by musician and composer JR Robinson, is an experimental music collective based in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Named after the BÃ©la Tarr movie Werckmeister Harmonies, it combines elements of drone music, serialism, post-rock, and heavy metal. Wrekmeister Harmonies typically performs a single composition, often almost an hour in length, beginning with a slow build, shifting into a cathartic middle section, concluding with either a peaceful or disquieting resolution.

In 2013, Wrekmeister Harmonies was signed to independent label Thrill Jockey, toured internationally with Grails and headlined in Europe. Wrekmeister Harmonies' albums have been featured in year-end lists of major publications and were praised by music critics. Andy Gensler of the Village Voice listed Recordings Made in Public Spaces as one of the top 10 Pazz and Jop albums of 2009. Spin selected You've Always Meant So Much to Me as one of the 20 Best Metal Albums of 2013, and Grayson Currin of Pitchfork rated the album as 7.9/10.
