Kayleth were born in the winter of 2005 in the east side of Verona aimed at founding a stoner band inspired to groups such as Kyuss, Orange goblin and 7zuma7.  A continuous soundâ€™s evolution generated self-produced demos and CDs: Not Yet (2006), In the Womb of Time (2008), Rusty Gold (2010) and The Survivor (2012).

Kayleth gigs drew a crowd with their rough psychedelic sounds and doom breaks so their fascinating power led them to support celebrated bands such as OJM and Deville and attend various festivals where they shared the stage among others with Bud Spencer Blues Explosion, Verdena, Naam, Spiral Arms and Scorpion Child.

At the beginning of 2012, they were able to get into the famous compilation "Desert Sound" (Vol. IV) with the song "The Survivor". This is a stoner rock compilation downloadable by Perkele.it, commonly approved and clapped by the huge world of stoner music.

In 2013, a new member with his synths started the Kayleth to explore new opportunities getting them close to the space/psych rock and launch new songs and a new forthcoming CD.
