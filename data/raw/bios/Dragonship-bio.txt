4 bad muthas sent on a mission from God to rock any and all faces they encounter.

In the Summer of 2004 guitarists Cole and Lyon got together and started on a quest to form Dragonship. Drummer Doe would join the band a few months later, and then in 2005, bass player Flex Bacontrim signed on. Unable to find a singer that fit the bands sound, Cole would soon take on lead vocal duties. After only limited rehearsal time with the whole line up, Dragonship then began playing shows around the Richmond area.

In the Spring of 2006 Dragonship recorded its first demo, a four song collection titled 'Set the Sails'. After a few shows in support of its release the band would lose drummer Doe due to a geographical change. Viper was selected in February of 2007 to fill the position.

Influenced by bands such as Iron Maiden, Yngwie J. Malmsteen's Rising Force, Dream Evil, and Rhapsody, Dragonship's sound is guitar driven melodic metal. Without fail the band will soon resume touring in support of 'Set the Sails' bringing their metal to all along the Atlantic shores. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dragonship">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
