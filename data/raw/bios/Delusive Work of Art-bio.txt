The Delusive Work Of Art was a gothic metal act in Singapore, whose 2005 EP "When Delusions Erupt" garned critics' praise for its avant-garde, dark experimental approach into the genre.

Unfortunately in June 2007, the band split apart, citing personal and creative issues. James Agony of the band is however, currently still involved in his solo project Choir of Agony. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Delusive+Work+Of+Art">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
