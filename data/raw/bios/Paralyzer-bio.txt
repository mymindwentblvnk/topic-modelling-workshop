There appear to be 2 artists named Paralyzer.

The first is a straight-edge hardcore band from Cincinnati, Ohio.  Brandon Hickle (bass), Robby Wright (guitar) and Carter Gilliss (drums) are all current members of Black Dove.  Matt Reed (ex-Youth Empowerment Project) is on vocals.  Brandon, Robby, and Matt were formerly in File & Claw together.  Lyrics focus upon hope, taking action and anti-establishment/anti-government themes.  Riffs are heavily influenced by Terror, but with lots of breakneck feel changes and split-second mosh parts.  They released a 5-song Demo.  A full-length on Solar Funeral is forthcoming.

From their site: "Paralyzer was formed by Brandon, Robby, and Matt after the collapse of their previous band, File & Claw, by adding badass Cincinnati drummer, Carter, to the mix.  Paralyzer started destroying America one poorly attended hardcore show at a time in the spring of 2007." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paralyzer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
