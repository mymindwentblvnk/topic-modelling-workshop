There is more than one band named Buzzard

1)  Buzzard from Victoria, BC
Stoner Rock with a touch of psych

As of 2013, three years in the going. Always looking for new adventures in tones and song writing. We do what ever feels right to us. Not conforming to anything. After a few member changes Buzzard has found it's current line up the best. Tune em low, tone it low and turning em up, is what we do.
