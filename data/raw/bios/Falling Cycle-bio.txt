Falling Cycle started in the summer of 1999, they just wanted to do something that was fun and heavy. As their tastes in music changed so did their style. Falling Cycle originally set out to be an old school hardcore band, but they ended up playing metal, because they couldn't escape their 80's metal roots.
 
Playing with bands like Point of Recognition, No Innocent Victim allowed them to make friends and get alot of outside attention. After playing 3 national US tours and lots of shows with bands like Hatebreed, NIV, Terror, Bleeding Through, Evergreen Terrace, Bloodlet and many many others Falling Cycle have recorded their first full length "The Conflict" which was released by Guideline Records in Europe.
 
With that debut record this brutal five piece from Riverside (Southern California) got many great reviews in the musicpress worldwide. Falling Cycle play a style which could be described by a mix of European (especially Scandinavian) metal, blistering hardcore, with amazingly structured breakdowns, that come together to form a sound comparable to bands like Darkest Hour, In Flames, ZAO or Throwdown. It's Metalchaos and it's Hardcorepower.
