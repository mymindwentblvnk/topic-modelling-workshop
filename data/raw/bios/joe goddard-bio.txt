Joe Goddard (aka Ulysses), has been a somewhat inescapable figure of the past few years. As vocalist, percussionist and synth-wizard in Hot Chip, he's seduced listeners from both rock and dance spheres over the course of three albums, melding live instrumentation and electronics with an irresistibly twee aesthetic. The group have always been interested in the dance floor, as proven by their remarkably diverse additions to the Bugged Out! and DJ Kicks catalogue, mountain of remixes and hectic DJing schedule, with Goddard spinning records either solo or alongside his Hot Chip companions.
