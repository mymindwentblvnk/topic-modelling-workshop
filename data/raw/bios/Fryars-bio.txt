Fryars is the London based project of Benjamin Garrett.

His first commercial release 'the ides', dates back to 2007. A year later frYarcorp was formed and in 2009, the debut album 'Dark Young Hearts' arrived. The record was co-produced with the help of Luke Smith (Clor, Foals), Paul Butler and Stephen Hague. It spawned the singles Visitors (with Dave Gahan on backing vocals) and Olive Eyes.

Love So Cold and In my arms, were released by Warner in 2013. A year later Cool like me and Radio PWR were released through Fiction Records/ Polydor.

Work on 'Power' commenced in 2010. Issues with his former label 679 and a merger between parent company Warner and Access Industries led to a massive delay in its release. Warner took the unprecedented step of freeing Garrett from his contract and returning the 'Power' album to him, with a final release date in November 2014.

The album was produced by Luke Smith and Rodaidh McDonald (The xx, How To Dress Well, Savages), mixed by Jimmy Douglass and includes Prettiest Ones Fly Highest and The Power. The album’s sixteen tracks are linked together by a script, written specifically for the record.

The singer-songwriter also penned two tracks for Lily Allen's 2014 album 'Sheezus’ and it features on Rae Morris' single Cold (feat. Fryars).
