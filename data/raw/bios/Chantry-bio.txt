Chantry is a Goth/Rock One-man-band founded in 2004 by the guitarist Alessandro Monopoli.

Chantry tries to unite the gothic atmospheres with the standard guitar music, using almost instrumental songs.

An LP is going to be released, with 40 minutes of completely original songs, with the singed song "Shine".
The album will be called "The Emancipation of Elizabeth" and will be available on September.

By now it's possible to buy the EP "July->Snow(Code)" on iTunes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chantry">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
