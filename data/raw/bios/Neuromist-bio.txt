Neuromist is a progressive death metal band from Moldova. Formed in 2004, the band went through a lot of lineup changes and played a number of shows both in Moldova and outside of it. The very first recording came in the form of the home-recorded demo entitled "Age of Human Errors" released in 2006. Then the band went on to compose and record its first full-length album "Move of Thought", which was released in 2010. Dealing with ongoing lineup changes Neuromist did little to promote the album live, yet had the opportunity to have a short tour through Poland and Czech Republic in 2011, which marked the band's first live appearance in the EU. Currently the band is working on a follow-up to their debut album, which is likely to be released some time during 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Neuromist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
