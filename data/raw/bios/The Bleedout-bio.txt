The Bleedout is a young finnish metal band with four members, all of them under the 20's. The band was formed in 2004. They only use a single guitarplayer. It has been much debated as of how The Bleedout's music should be defined as, many rank them as metalcore, some as alternative metal. The Bleedout takes elements from many genres of metal and mixes them into their output, which is very "new school" in a way.

In 2006 they released their first demo that contained two songs. 2007 the band released another demo, titled Let It Bleed. The demo gained some pretty good reviews and was sold out. The demo took The Bleedout's music in a heavier, more aggressive and straight forward direction, adding more death metalish tones and some hardcore attitude in the mix.

In 2008 their only guitarist left the band and the band needed to fill the hole as soon as possible. 
Instead of just one guitarist they hired two for the job and since then TBO has been a 5-piece.  

They're heading up to UK tour in June 2009.
The band is releasing a EP in 2009, and it is yet to be seen, what the new year holds in store for this band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Bleedout">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
