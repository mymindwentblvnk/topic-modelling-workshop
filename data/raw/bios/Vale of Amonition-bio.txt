Vale Of Amonition came into existence in Kampala, Uganda in 2009 drawing on blues-rock influences like Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix. They managed to get down only one song from that period, a pseudo-Deep Purple, blues-of-the-gut pastiche titled "Downtown Blues". Quickly moving on from that, they decided to play music they were actually good at; HEAVY METAL! A stable line up came together, maintaining Vickonomy at the helm on vocals and guitar and new members Japh Horns on bass and Jon Xarg on drums drawing strictly from Doom influences. They made "Black Cathedral", a loose but awesome traditional stomping heavy metal epic in three parts and then proceeded to formulate their most ambitious work "When Philosophy Turns Dark".
