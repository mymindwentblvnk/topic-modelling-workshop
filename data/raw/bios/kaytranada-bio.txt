Kaytranada, the Montreal-raised producer, arrived during the early 2010s with ear-perking remixes and an array of sounds that veered from J Dilla-inspired hip-hop beats to distinctly woozy house grooves. Numerous commissioned works and short-form solo releases led to his debut album, 99.9%—which went on to win the 2016 Polaris Music Prize and the 2017 Juno Award for Electronic Album of the Year. Since signing to major-label RCA, the Haitian-Canadian has released his sophomore album, Bubba.   

Kaytranada has worked with a wide array of artists including Anderson .Paak, Kendrick Lamar, Chance the Rapper, Robert Glasper, Lauren Faith, Mick Jenkins, GoldLink, Snopp Dogg, Freddie Gibbs, and Alicia Keys. His 2016 debut album, 99.9% features guest appearances from Phonte, Craig David, Vic Mensa, Little Dragon, and more. Bubba, his second album, was released the following December with Pharrell, Kali Uchis, and Masego among the contributors—and has won the young producer 2 Grammys at the 2021 Grammy Awards. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kaytranada">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
