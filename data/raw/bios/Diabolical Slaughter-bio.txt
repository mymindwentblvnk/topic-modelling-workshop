Diabolical Slaughter is a Brutal Death Metal band from San Diego, California. DS started out around 2005 and has gone through line-up changes since then but we are here and still killing, and we have hit a few bumps along the way, but thats what makes the band stronger. We are here to get our name out and play what we love to play and that is heavy, fast, sick fucking Death Metal. The local scene has treated us well, and has shown their support and we have wait to see how many DS fans there are out there in the world. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diabolical+Slaughter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
