Hailing from Denmark, Causa Sui consists of Jakob Skøtt, Jonas Munk, Rasmus Rasmussen and Jess Kahr, and have released seven albums since 2005 – most notably the trilogy set Summer Sessions that saw the band move away from the heavy-psych of their two first albums to more abstract, instrumental sounds that owes as much to electric Miles Davis or Can as to american stoner-rock. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Causa+Sui">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
