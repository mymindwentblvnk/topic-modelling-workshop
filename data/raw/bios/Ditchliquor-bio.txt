Ditchliquor is a diverse band from Portland, Oregon who combine classic metal with doom, stonerrock, psychadelic, crust, punk and indie rock. Formed in late 2003, the band was formed by Joe Wickstrom (bass, vocals), Shawn Davis (drums, vocals), and Evan Enge (guitar, vocals). In 2004, the group brought in Matt Blair to take over the vocal responsibilities, but that same year they returned to their original power-trio form.  They played shows alongside bands such as Rwake, Brant Bjork, YOB, Valis, Priestess, Biblical Proof of UFOs, Napalm Beach, the Unsane, Big Business, and High on Fire. In early 2005, Evan Enge left the group to return to New York City, where he initially hailed, and they brought in Jim Taylor (Poison Idea, BAST) as his replacement. They continued until 2006, at which point they disbanded. The group released one EP with Matt Blair and one full-length as a trio. The follow up album, recorded with Jim Taylor, was never released.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ditchliquor">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
