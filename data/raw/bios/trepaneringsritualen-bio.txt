Trepaneringsritualen (abbreviated as T × R × P) explores themes of religion, magick and the occult realms of consciousness, taking its musical cues from the old school of ritual ambient & death industrial. Rhythmic and seething at times, and oozing forward with a creeping sense of desolation, T × R × P conjures forth bleak but mesmerizing visions of the end-times. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trepaneringsritualen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
