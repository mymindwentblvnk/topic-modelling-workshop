SCEPTOCRYPT Press Release, Nov 2014, London

The original Sceptocrypt formed on the island of Malta in 1992.

A band from the smallest European nation yet with big intentions – to forge a sound distinctively its own, an extreme metal (at a time where the tag was not yet penned to define bands cross-bordering doom, death, black metal and more) looking out of its own box (including non-metal styles, but without loosing its abrasive edge!), its members ardently into the 90s underground scene running Rancid Soup zine & radio show and music scholars alike, always keen for original sounds, as inspirations and as their own.

Releasing only a demo & a rehearsal tape in its timespan to 1999, Sceptocrypt's idea was received warmly, with worldwide reviews as “demo of the month”, “one of the best demos of 1996”, “ALL labels interested in progressive extreme metal please check in with Sceptocrypt”, “not your everyday kind of metal”, “a hell of a musical masterpiece, “one of the most brilliant demotapes I have heard in years”, “don’t know where to put this band in, maybe a big positive plus-point for them”, “recommended for a zine editor with 5000 bands yet no-one sounding like Sceptocrypt”, “such different and sophisticated music”, “Sceptocrypt have good solutions for their music, something that the majority of underground bands have not” by the leading press of the time like Aardschock (NL), Fight Amnesia (DE), Ill Literature (USA), Koito (IT), MorticiaNumskull (NL), Dusk Woerot (Colombia), Death Bite (Lith), Fanfare (BE), Brutalism.com (NL), Eternal Darkness (USA), etc.

There was also label interest back then. Some, like Holy Records (FR) & Bliss Records (UK) defined Sceptocrypt as “experimental music, very well structured, unbelievable!!!” and “death metal usually does absolutely nothing for me, but this band are more melodic, innovative and original than I was expecting” while others were interested to hear more. 

In fact, the band self-financed and recorded a full-length !26 Hrs 72 mins …. the need to differ) in 1999. Sadly disbanding later that year due to a string of adverse effects (including financial), this CD was never released nor promoted to any label/zine. In fact, apart from some tracks featuring in compilations (Underground Media, Ematofagia, and Mass Metal), only few close contacts have listened to the whole !26 Hrs 72 Mins …. the need to differ).

Now available to all in 2014 at our YouTube, also to co-incide with the return of Sceptocrypt, yes 15 years later, and in a different country, and with yet again a different sound!

Away from Malta and travelling around, Sceptocrypt's founder and main composer Malcolm “Gool” Callus always knew in his heart that at some point he would have to find a place to call home, to put at rest an idea that has never abandoned him – to re-launch Sceptocrypt!

In 2007, he moved to London, becoming prolifically active with an avant-garde world music band EthnaMorte. Yet, as a fan he never stopped following extreme metal (you can here check his post-Sceptocrypt pre-Ethnamorte metal bands) & other forms of extreme music, especially bands with something fresh to offer!

So when drummer Adriano Ferraro – himself an exponent of many a metal style with his works for Eyes Of Solitude (funeral doom), Nebukadnezza (thrash/grind), Cythraul (old school death metal), and Justonefix (groove-laden hardcore/death metal) – asked Malcolm to form an all-encompassing extreme metal band with something new to say, it was agreed that together they shall give birth to a new Sceptocrypt beast.

Rehearsals starting late August 2014, it seemed that Malcolm’s 20 years teaching guitar, bass & music theory in different genres was waiting for Adriano’s ferocity to blast through something extreme! Ideas flowed seamlessly from a myriad of music influences both had been subject to, subsequently put into form of 6 songs (60 mins and counting) in less than 2 months.

With plenty of twisted riffs and unexpected changes at the core of this new sound being tagged as “extreme music research”, 2014 brings Sceptocrypt’s re-incarnation in the heart of good ole Londinium town, England!

Still meant to sound nihilistic & adversary without replicating Sceptocrypt 92-99 (after all, the world has gone through 15 years of new musical discovery), Sceptocrypt look forward to present new music in 2015!
