Arkeisha Antoinette Knight, known professionally as Kash Doll, is an American rapper from Detroit, Michigan. By her early twenties, Knight channeled her life-long love of hip-hop and performance into concentrated efforts to begin a rap career, leaving behind work as an exotic dancer, adopting the Kash Doll moniker, and booking gigs in the Detroit area in 2014. After dropping the well-received single covering AV's "Run Me My Money," Kash Doll released her first mixtape, K.R.E.A.M. Kash Rules Everything Around Me, in early 2015 with production on some tracks from 808 Mafia member Purps. Late the next year she returned with another online mixtape, Keisha vs. Kash Doll. While working toward a proper debut full-length, she released the single "For Everybody" in early 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kash+Doll">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
