Formed mid 2009 by Ross on guitar (Pervertor) and Steve drums (Red Dawn and ex Karnage and Demoniac) with the intent of making a big noise and playing some old school Black metal. Tim (ex Defilogen) soon joined on bass and found his capacity for evil vocals, and thus Bulletbelt was born. May 2010 The Black Army Stands EP is being recorded, with nationwide touring to follow. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bulletbelt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
