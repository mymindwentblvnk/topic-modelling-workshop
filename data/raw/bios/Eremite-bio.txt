Eremite began at the end of 2012 as the creation of Fabio Cuomo.
His need for a compositional independence brought him to write on his own “Of Mist And Fog” (only available online) , a 20 minute doom/sludge-influenced track.

Thrilled with the result, Fabio kept on with this project and on March 2013 he released his first full-length: “Dragonarius”, recorded at Green Fog Studio by Mattia Cominotto and released by Taxi Driver Records (that also released in 2014 the self-titled debut album of his other band, Mope).

“Dragonarius” received rave reviews from the beginning and Fabio decided he wanted to play his music live. 

Eremite from a one-man project bacame a band: Fabio Cuomo (drums, vocals), Giulia Piras (bass) and Leandro Scotto (guitar, also playing in Synodik) started playing live shows around Italy, sharing the stage with bands like Chelsea Wolfe, Elder, Jex Thoth, Oranssi Pazuzu and Belzebong.

The excellent and newfound compositional alchemy between Fabio and Giulia led them to enter the Green Fog studio again in early 2014 to develop the initial idea of the project, combining their two souls and creating their second album: “All Things Merge Into One” recorded, mixed and mastered by Mattia Cominotto. 

The album is out on October 7th via Taxi Driver Records, in CD and digital format, cover artwork by Jessica Rassi, and is distributed worldwide via Taxi Driver Record Store. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eremite">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
