3 piece stoner/grove band emanating from guernsey (ci) 

You'll definitely feel the full force of this new Guernsey trio. The absence of a vocalist draws plenty of attention to their hypnotic experimental music which ebbs and flows like a strong swamp tide.The music is lead by classic stoner rock riffs, dripping with thick overdrive to create a sludgy fuzzy bluesy sound backed by the solid doom drums/bass grooves of the Mariess brothers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brunt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
