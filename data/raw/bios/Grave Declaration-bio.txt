"Grave Declaration started out as a project where I wanted to make worship songs in the metal genre. Through the years I have hardly ever found a church that played music I felt comfortable with, so I figured I would try to write some myself. I believe that when the church uses music as a tool for worshiping God, it's a much more powerful tool when you can associate to the music. When it comes to the lyrics, I've gone in some of the same direction as David does with the psalms in the bible. In a lot of the psalms, he describes his circumstances, how bad everything is, how he feels like he's dying, or people want him killed, but through it all, God is still worthy of praise, and in God, he finds hope and comfort." - Thor
