Madsword is a Progressive Metal/Rock band from Italy which was founded in 1987 by guitarist Gianni GUERRA. Today's incarnation of MADSWORD consists of Walter POD (drums), Andrea "Bedo" BEDIN (vocals), Lorenzo CASTELLARIN (keyboards) and Simon ROSANI (bass guitar). The emphasis on the melodies is very noticeable. The music ranges from heavy to mellow, and everything in between, which makes it all the more pleasurable listening to keep a listener intrigued from start to finish. Fans of DREAM THEATER, FATES WARNING and older QUEENSRYCHE will really appreciate their discs. For prog metal/rock fans, this band is a must. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MadSword">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
