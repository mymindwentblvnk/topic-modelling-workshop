Night Terror began back in late 2002 as a Slayer and Metallica cover band. A couple months after in mid 2003, the main concentration of the band turned to creating our own music. Trying to combine our old thrash influences where our roots laid, with new bands that are making a big impact in todays metal scene such as: The Black Dahlia Murder, Behemoth, Dimmu Borgir, and many others.

Today Nigh Terror is preparing to release our new relentless attack of new music upon to the metal masses.
