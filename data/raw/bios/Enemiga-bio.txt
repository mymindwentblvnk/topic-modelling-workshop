Enemiga is a Hungarian progressive metal band from Budapest with hardcore influences. Formed in the fall of 2006, the group had originally five members (with separate bassist and singer), but in the beginning of year 2007 bassist Utry Gyula left the band. The others decided to go on and now Kovács "Béci" István handles both bass and vocals. In the spring of the same year, four songs were recorded, but they are no longer available anywhere due to personal reasons (the band didn't find that these songs reflect the true combination raw, agressive, complex and melodic atmosphere of their music). During summer they played cuople of times live, but their most important goal was to practice their songs in the loneliness of the rehearsing room, waiting for the fall to record their songs in a little place called "SP. Studio". The session turned out to be rather good, four songs are now available on their official homepage (Shot To The Head, Lost In Existence, May The Insane Be Unknown and a cover track Rose Of Sharyn). According to the guys, it's only the beginning, or as they call it, "pre-demo",  beacuse there will be more songs available in the future in better quality. Stay tuned for more!
