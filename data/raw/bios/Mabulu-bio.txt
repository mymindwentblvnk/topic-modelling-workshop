Maputo-based multi-generational collective Mabulu are one of a number of nu-generation African bands balancing dance music, traditional roots sounds, and the verbal acrobatics and conscious social lyrics of rap and hip-hop.

Mabulu was brought together by East German Roland Hohberg, who was living in Maputo. He brought together the best of several different musical genres and generations for this project. They are part of the burgeoning musical scene in Mozambique, and have toured successfully throughout Europe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mabulu">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
