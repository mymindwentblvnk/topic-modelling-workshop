Formed in Tampa, Florida by guitarist Buddy Richardson, a veteran of the late-60s and early-70s Florida scene (The Outsiders, Soul Trippers, Noah's Ark), White Witch played an eclectic mix of psychedelia, prog, power pop, heavy Southern rock and glam rock, with painted faces, powerful vocals and some strange lyrics. They developed a devoted live following around the southeast, and their  two albums (on Capricorn Records) are highly rated by some, ignored by others. Flashy vocalist Ronn Goedert was renowned for his histrionics; he sounded like a more glam Robert Plant. Some say he influenced Axel Rose, but that's debatable. Goedert passed away in 2000, as did keys man Buddy Pendergrass in 2003. Remaining members have played sporadically over the years. Highlights include "Home Grown Girl" from the first LP. "Showdown", "Class of 2000", and "Walk On" from 'Spiritual Greeting'.
