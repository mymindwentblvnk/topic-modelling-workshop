DJ Jean spun his records literally all over the world, more than 20 countries, in every club, every festival, and on every occasion you can think of.

This includes the incredible dutch ID&T parties Sensation , 
Innercity, Mysteryland and Dance Valley by UDC, all parties that host crowds of more than 40.000 people. Festivals this size he also played in Australia, Poland, U.S.A., Russia, Germany, U.K., South Africa, etc. etc.! 

DJ Jean's career started out as the Dutch mix and scratch champion back in the late eighties. Since then he won 6 BEST DJ AWARDS at several elections in The Netherlands and around the globe, and was more than 15 times nominated on occasions such as the silver star dance awards in the UK, TMF awards, Basic Groove Dutch dance awards, etc.. 

His productions also gained worldwide fame with legendary anthem "The Launch" on top, selling over 1.000.000 copies worldwide! His power and popularity is mainly caused by his technical skills and his ability to play very groovy and pumpin' club as well as trance and hardstyle. 

These days he is more active then ever with several club residencies all over the country, a very successful radio show every Friday night at the Dutch radio station Radio 538, and more bookings nationally and internationally than he can handle.

DJ Jean is always one with his audience, and is a party animal himself, often to be found between the people who are partying when  he is finished playing!
