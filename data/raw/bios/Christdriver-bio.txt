The band formed in Seattle, USA, from the ashes of Subvert sometime in 1991, but rather than the hardcore/punk style that Subvert explored, Christdriver was much more of a cold, industrial metal act: think bleak dissonance, pulsing slow to mid-paced tempos, plenty of samples, hypnotic repetition, and long songs that average around seven minutes each.

They made their recorded debut in 1995 with the ""Your Vision Leaves Me Blind" 7" and followed that up in 1996 with the 70+ minute "Everything Burns". Shortly thereafter they split-up and some of the members joined Black Noise Cannon.

According to their MySpace they reformed in 2011 for at least one live show in Seattle. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Christdriver">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
