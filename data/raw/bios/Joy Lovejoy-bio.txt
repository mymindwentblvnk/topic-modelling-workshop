Nothing is known of "Joy Lovejoy", and her identity is open to speculation. The singer produced only one song, In Orbit, released in the US on Checker Records in 1967 and in the UK on Chess in 1972. Included in "The Northern Soul Top 500", In Orbit has seen a second press on Chess and a re-issue on Argo Records due to its increasing popularity on the Northern Soul scene.

The rumours and theories surrounding Lovejoy's identity include that she was a session singer allowed her moment in the sun, or a Chess/Checker star performing under a pseudonym, or a star from a different label assuming a name to evade licensing issues. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joy+Lovejoy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
