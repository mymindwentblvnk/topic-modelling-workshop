Bloomsday was a 1989-90 project featuring vocalist Chris Thompson (The Bathers, Friends Again), and Neil Clark and Stephen Irvine (both from Lloyd Cole's band The Commotions). Musically, the project is often more rock-oriented than Thompson's Bathers project. But several tracks fortell the style Thompson would susequently pursue in The Bathers. In particular, "Forever Through Traps and Lies" could easily have been a Bathers track. The Bloomsday album and single are well worth seeking out for fans of Thompson's other projects. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bloomsday">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
