BIO
The project started in 2006 when A. Dettori, M. Virdis, E. Ottani, A. "Wube" Baroni and N. Degli Angeli joined and the band reached the first known line-up. 
Soon, thanx to their experience in other bands from the Modena's extreme metal scene (Hatred, Morphing Primals, Absence of Light, Incineritor), the Unbirth project toke off.
.
In 2008 a 4-track split-cd with Modena's grinders Recreant was out.
.
Unfortunately, due to personal problems, IN 2008 A. Dettori left the band. After some months to this replacement also N. Degli Angeli left the band.
.
From 2008 to 2010 the band's pigsty vocals was performed by A. "Babu" Malfatto - RIP - (also in Hobnailed, Discordance).
We will never forget those days with him and his amazing work with us surely will not get lost in time.
.
In autumn 2010 A. Dettori is back on vocals and Marcello Tavernari (HIP, ex-Murder Therapy) has taken the bass player slot.
.
In 2011 a 3 track Promo is out, you can download for free here! http://www.deathmetalinvasion.com/2011/08/unbirth-promo-2011.html
