Diablerie is a Finnish band that mixes industrial and black metal sounds in their music. Their debut, "Astro", came out in 1999. Not content with it, Diablerie added to their depth a variety of synth sounds on "Seraphyde", their second release from 2001. As already shown by their demo cd "Astro", Diablerie still likes to do it wild and fast.
Line-up consists of H.J. Villberg (vocals), E. Lund√©n (guitar), K. Tukiainen (guitar), A. Ahokas (bass), A. Ruokoladrums, and J. Suorsa (keys and electronics). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diablerie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
