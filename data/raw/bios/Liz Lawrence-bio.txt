Liz Lawrence is an English singer-songwriter and guitarist, known for her solo work and for being half of electro-pop duo Cash+David. 

Ever since Liz Lawrence discovered the guitar she was determined to make acoustic music an exciting, fresh and honest genre. Playing in punk and ska bands as a guitarist in her early teens, she finally managed to take the mic and found herself entranced and engaged in a full blown love affair with live performance. Liz's punk history may not be obvious on first impressions but once she starts to march on the stage her fiery and precocious nature cannot be suppressed.
