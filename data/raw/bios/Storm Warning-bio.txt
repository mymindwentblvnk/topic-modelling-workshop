Storm Warning is a band of five diverse influences that happens to make distinctive, exciting music. The blues are the heart of the sound, but the blues is a form that changes its shape and character to suit whoever is playing it.

The blues harmonica of Son Maxwell shares the lead with the rock and jazz influenced guitar of Bob Moore, with the classic Hammond and piano sounds of Ian Salisbury adding an additional blues-based dimension. 

Drummer Roger Willis, formerly with Capability Brown and Krazy Kat, and bassist Derek White complete the line-up, forming what The Blues Band bass man Gary Fletcher described as “an ace rhythm section.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Storm+Warning">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
