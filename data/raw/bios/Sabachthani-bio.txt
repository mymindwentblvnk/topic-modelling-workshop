Sabachthani started out in 2002 with the intention of playing goth-oriented rock music. Over the years our style has evolved and adapted into a much more epic and grandiose form of doom or/and gothic metal.
Mellow and slow of pace, our often progressive approach to music and vivid, storytelling lyrics is guaranteed to satisfy most fans of the darker side of metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sabachthani">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
