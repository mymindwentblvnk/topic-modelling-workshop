Uncompromising, ruthless and sanguinary pack from Poland. The band started in cold night in 2012, when four death cultists fueled by unholy spirits of such cult acts like Morbid Angel, Bathory, Watain and Destroyer 666 decided to play their version of death metal with influences of black metal scene. Poland always was the motherland of extreme metal, and this time her next child MORTHUS is ready to spread chaos and blasphemy worldwide.
