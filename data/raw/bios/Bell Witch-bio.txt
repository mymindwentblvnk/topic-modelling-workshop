Bell Witch was formed in Seattle in 2010 by drummer Adrian Guerra (also of Sod Hauler and Lethe), and bassist Dylan Desmond (also of Samothrace). The duo released two albums, Longing in 2012 and Four Phantoms in 2015, before Guerra left the band due to health reasons. He later died in 2016. 
In 2017, with new drummer Jesse Shreibman, Bell Witch released Mirror Reaper, a single 83 minute long song, to critical acclaim. It was dedicated to the memory of Guerra. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bell+Witch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
