Alias of R.M. Hall/Moby (1 release).

â€¢

Matt a.k.a. Mindstorm first became interested in DrumnBass at the age of 12 after listening to the album "New Forms" from Roni Size & Reprazent. Being a bassplayer heavily influenced by jazz music, the basslines on the track "Brown Paper Bag" matched with the drums served as the perfect introduction to this fast-paced and exciting genre of music. Now at age 22, with almost 9 years of experience as a producer, he strive's to bring his own unique sound to the DrumnBass arena with every new release. Matt takes an entirely analog/acoustic driven approach to his music-making putting endless work into creating new and original sounds on every track he produces. His frequent use of acoustic instruments allows him to incorporate his knowledge of the piano, guitar, and drums which he picked up at a younger age, and still continue developing his love for the bass guitar in the process. 

With over 70 original tracks already under his belt you can be sure to see Mindstorm in more and more places as time goes on. Being a true perfectionist at heart he sometimes spends hours on just a 10-15 second part believing in the saying "quality over quantity" and always applying it to the music he produces. Mindstorm's other projects include recording and producing a wide-range of music for other artist's albums. He also contributes music for various commercials and tv spots. His newly launched record label Mindstorm Records promises to be an outlet for new and exciting DrumnBass in the years to come.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mindstorm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
