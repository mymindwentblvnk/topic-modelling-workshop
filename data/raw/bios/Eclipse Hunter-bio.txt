Eclipse Hunter is a Russian power progressive metal band formed in 2004 by keyboardist/songwriter Andre Osokin. The band has performed live since 2006, when the first line-up was totally complete. One of their most notable shows was support act for Royal Hunt in 2008. Eclipse Hunter released a digital demo EP entitled Lost Symphony in February 2007 and started recording a full-length album the same year. The production was complete in May 2009 and a few months later, their debut album One was released by an independent label NewRock. The music on One cannot be described by a single rock subgenre. It contains elements of melodic, power, progressive and symphonic rock/metal.
The band went thru a few lineup changes before they started recording their new album entitled Unlimited Edition, which also features a guest appearance by Andr√© Andersen. First single off the new album - Heartbreaker was released in September 2011, while the album release was set for 11.11.11.

The band decided to go on a hiatus after a series of farewell concerts in the end of 2013.
