Kiasmos is made up of Icelandic BAFTA-winning composer Ólafur Arnalds, known for his unique blend of minimal piano and string compositions with electronic sounds, and Janus Rasmussen from the Faroe Islands, known as the mastermind of the electro-pop outfit Bloodgroup. Based in Reykjavík, Arnalds used to work as a sound engineer, often for Rasmussen's other projects, where the two musicians discovered their common love for minimal, experimental music. They eventually became best friends, often hanging out in their studio, exploring electronic sounds.

Erased Tapes records released the duo first tracks ‘65’ and ‘Walled' on March 30, 2009. As huge fans of label colleague Ryan Lee West alias RIVAL CONSOLES, Arnalds and Rasmussen shared the split 12”/Download release ‘65/Milo’. It was followed by the 'Thrown EP' in September 2012, which contains the title track 'Thrown', 'Wrecked' plus a remix for each track.
 
'Looped', a track from their eponymous album, surfaced on-line in December 2013. 'Burnt', was promo-ed in August 2014, with the 'Kiasmos' album release details (October 27, 2014).
