Brutally honest, creative and constantly evolving, Croatian based Infernal Tenebra withstood the test of time in the metal underground. Originating with pure black metal in 1999, adding a death metal foundation in the following years, with two self-released albums „Beneath the Twilight“ and „The Essence of Chaos“, the band is heading to a new chapter with the upcoming album „New Formed Revelations“, mixed and mastered by Jens Bogren (Kreator, Paradise Lost, Amon Amarth etc.) at Fascination Street Studios, released by Massacre Records. Infernal Tenebra shared the stage with a vast number of metal icons including Kreator, Vader, Symphony X, Exodus, Blind Guardian, Agathodaimon, Pro-pain and Grave Digger and played festivals like Bloodstock Open Air, Metalcamp and Metalfest. With rock solid rhythms, dynamic and technical solos, powerful vocals and the will to concentrate on their music and compositions rather than only perfomance, Infernal Tenebra is the true representative of the Croatian extreme metal music.
