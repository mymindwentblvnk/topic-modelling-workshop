DISAFFECTED were formed in '91 in Portugal by drummer Joaquim Aires and Sergio Paulo (Guitar/Vocals), as a Death/thrash metal band. Later adding Zakk (Guitar) and Sergio Monteiro on bass, the band released "...After..." demo in '92, and later that same year they were included in "The Birth of a Tragedy" (MTM '92), a vinyl compilation of portuguese metal bands with the song "Echoes Remain". In '93 line-up changes ensued as they recruited bass player Antonio Giao, vocalist Gon√ßalo Cunha and guest vocalist Nuno Loureiro (Exiled) and performed a lot of shows with this line-up.
Later their music had become more progressive and complex, and in '94 keyboard player Fatima Geronimo and vocalist Jose Costa (Sacred Sin) joined the band and they got signed by Skyfall Records (Portugal) and released "Vast" full-length album in 1995. This album was recorded at Namouche Studios (Lisbon) and produced by Marsten Bailey. Disaffected's "Vast", which includes "Thou Art Lord" (Acheron cover), is an important reference in the progressive metal scene, as one of the best metal productions ever done in Portugal. A videoclip for the song "Vast - The Long Tomorrow" was recorded to promote the album "Vast", and they've also covered "Seasons in the Abyss" for the Slayer tribute album "Slatanic Slaughter II" (Black Sun Records '96).
In '97 the band stop activity due to internal problems. No more shows were performed since then. Until now the band is in sleep mode, not dead yet... 

...and its coming back to live! Keyboard player Bianca and drummer O joined the band and the reunion happens!
