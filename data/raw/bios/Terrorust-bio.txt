Terrorust was born from the womb of carnage. A pure malevolent lust of extreme musical chaos. In late 2005, good mates, Matt Sanders and Fanza O'Grady, began writing the groundwork that would become their debut release 'Post Mortal Archives'. After 6 months of intensive writing and recording, the songs were completed and were taken into 3 Phase Studios. With Dav Byrne joining on Bass, the result was a brutally cohesive and original release,'Post Mortal Archives'.

After their debut gig with International metal acts, Nevermore and Skinless, Terrorust began gaining ground. In late 2006, Andrew Gillan (ABOMINATOR, BESTIAL WARLUST, CEMETERY URN) joined the fold on guitar and completed the lineup. Terrorust then finished of the year with a tour supporting American Death Metal kings 'Deicide' with great success.

Early 2007 saw a lineup change, with James Ludbrook leaving and Terrorust enlisting the vocal talents of Matt Storma (TORSORGY/CAVITY MAGGOT). With the lineup now solid the band has focused on performing a large number of shows and the re-recording of their underground debut 'Post Mortal Archives'.

With a busy year ahead, Terrorust hope to find time to demo new material and prepare to record their 2nd release.
