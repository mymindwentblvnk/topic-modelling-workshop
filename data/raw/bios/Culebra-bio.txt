Culebra is also the name of a band which was active in the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1980s, performing a repertoire of many genres of original Caribbean and Latin dance music.  Named after the small island off the coast of Puerto Rico by the same name, the group was one of the leading groups playing at clubs, festivals such as the Haight Street Fair and, in particular, the San Francisco Carnaval during the golden age of the SF Carnaval in the early 80s when the Carnaval parade in San Francisco went from 26th Street in the Mission all the way downtown to the heart of Civic Center. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Culebra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
