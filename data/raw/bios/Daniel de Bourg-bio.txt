Daniel DeBourg (born 13 April 1981, Chelmsford, Essex) is an English pop singer, songwriter, former dancer and model. In 2007, he was a finalist on the fourth UK series of the TV talent show, The X Factor.

Although dedicated to dance, DeBourg also had an early interest in singing and was vocalist for several bands during his adolescence. After a knee injury ended his dance career, DeBourg turned his hand to songwriting; recorded by R&B songstress Jamelia in 2000, his song "Money" reached #5 on the UK Singles Chart. DeBourg was encouraged by a friend to create several demos of his own singing. These attracted the interest of Dreamworks scout Robbie Robertson. DeBourg was introduced to then in house producers Tim & Bob and subsequently signed to the label and the duo produced his debut album, Tell the World. The high-production album, released in 2002, launched the single "I Need an Angel", which hit #30 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.

In 2007, DeBourg auditioned for the fourth series of The X Factor and reached the final twelve acts to sing in the live rounds of the competition. He was mentored by Louis Walsh, but was eliminated by the public and judges on 27 October 2007.

In 2008, UK artist DJ Ironik presented DeBourg on his new album, No Point In Wasting Tears. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+de+Bourg">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
