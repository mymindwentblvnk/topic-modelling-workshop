Pervencer is a very technical Death Metal from the city of Sorocaba (SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil). They'd started out as a very underground outift recording a low bugdet demo called Labyrinth of Death in 2009. Two years later they recorded an EP called Extermination Is Right with a much better production. Although in 2019 they've just released their great produced album called Apocalyptic Suffering digitally. It contains elements of jazz and other uncommon traits for Brazilian bands. For fans of Cryptopsy, Origin, Atheist, Death and the likes. Available mainly on Youtube. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pervencer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
