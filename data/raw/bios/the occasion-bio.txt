The Occasion (now split up) was a New York-based band that began working together in 2000 and disbanded in 2006. In that time, they evolved into a line-up as puzzling and involved as their sound. Lead and backing vocals switch between acoustic/electric pianist Brent Cordero, guitarist Jordi Wheeler and drummer Charles Burst, also included were Marlon Sporer, bass guitar and Sara Shaw, tape loops & percussion. The Occasion was a unique and innovative part of the Brooklyn music collective, inspiring a number of subsequent bands that now make up the Brooklyn music scene. The combination of accomplished musicianship, well-composed songs and mesmerizing sound, its no wonder the group developed a following and critical attention.
Critically praised, they caught the ear of James Endeacott, formally of Rough Trade Records, who’s accredited with signing The Strokes and The Libertines. Endeacott chose The Occasion as the premier group for his new company, 1965 Records in 2005. Unfortunately, the group disbanded the following year - The Occasion’s material can be found on four labels: Say Hey Records (US), Ernest Jenning Records -Gatefold album (US), 1965 Records (UK), Smash Records (AU).
