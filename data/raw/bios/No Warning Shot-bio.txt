No Warning Shot was started in mid 2002 by Toby (Guitar/vVcals) and Merv (Vocals) with no real intention of taking the project any further than Toby's 8 track.

Fed up with the current state of pretty boy "core" bands and easy scene bullshit, the duo released a 6 track mini album which they circulated for free. Among the many listeners bleeding from the ears were the fine organisers of the infamous "Uxfest" who approached Toby to enquire about the possibilities of No Warning Shot performing . Within a week Toby and Merv had assembled a band of "borrowed" members and the band embarked on their first live shows with the outcome of many new fans.....

After this unexpected yet sucessful hype and due to other priorities, No Warning Shot became dormant. Two years down the line, 2005 saw the rebirth of a spanking new line-up, all with the same drive, dedication and determination to bringing the old skool thrash sounds to the hair conditioned, fring queens of the "new skool".

The self released album "Here To Settle The Score" is out now and with an ever growing following the band continue to cause complete mayhem in every city they pass through. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/No+Warning+Shot">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
