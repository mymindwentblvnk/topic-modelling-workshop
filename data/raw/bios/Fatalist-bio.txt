There is more than one artist with this name:

1. This American band was originally thought of as an all swedish death metal cover band called Stockholm Syndrome. After it was known that some of the members were not going to actually commit to doing it, the band was put on hold for a while.

In the spring of 2006, Wes Caley (Uphill Battle, Exhumed) decided that he would like to make a version of the band that did original songs instead of cover songs but in the same style as Entombed, Nihilist, Grave, Dismember, and Unleashed. He contacted Neil Burkdoll (Dirty Dead, Stump) after hearing his POOR project that he did that was similar to what Wes had in mind for his Swedish style band.

Just as Wes made contact with Neil, he found out that Neil was actually moving out to California in the near future. They decided it was time to get together create FATALIST. Eventually Fatalist enlisted Tyler Castro and Art Hayes (ex-Butchery) to complete the line-up on drums and bass.

In late summer of 2007, the band recorded a 7 song demo cd called "Loss" and started looking for shows to play in California.

In Feb 2008, Fatalist signed to Ibex Moon Records!!!

In The Depths Of Inhumanity was released in November of 2009 by Ibex Moon records. 

Wes Caley left the band soon after and has now rejoined Exhumed full time.  He was replaced by guitarist Matt Drexler and lead vocalist Mike Pinkerton.  This line up recorded a cover of Beyond The Unholy Grave by Death for the movie sound track of The After Party Massacre.  

After a 3 year hiatus, Neil and Wes decided to make another album.  This time signed to FDA Rekotz from Germany, the second album will be out September 2016, and is called The Bitter End.

2. Black metal/hardcore from Leeds, England, UK
