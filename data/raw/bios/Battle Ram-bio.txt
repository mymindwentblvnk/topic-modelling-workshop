Battle Ram started playing together at the end of the summer 2001 in Ascoli Piceno, Italy as a cover band; in the beginning it was just for the fun of playing their favourite songs: mainingly U.S. Metal, NWOBHM and cult epic stuff, then they started writing their own material. On the 22th of October 2002 they were the opening band for the one and only Manilla Road show in Italy and the first Doomsword show ever, then thanks to some greek friends who were at that show and liked it so much, they had the wonderful opportunity to play in Athens as guest for their friends  Doomsword in March 2003, just few days before they had released their first demo cd. The self titled 5 tracks demo contains 4 Battle Ram songs and a Cirith Ungol’s “Join The Legion” coversong. The demo got really good reviews in Italy, Germany and Greece and now Battle Ram are writing new material for their first album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Battle+Ram">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
