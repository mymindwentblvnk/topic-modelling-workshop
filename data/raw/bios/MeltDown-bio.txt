Meltdown could refer to one of several bands:
1) Meltdown is a Hardcore/Thrash Metal band with members  based in both Rhode Island and Massachusetts. They have released two eps and a 7" with the most recent being "Demolition", released in the summer of 2007 on Malfunction records. The band often play shows with Shipwreck and other MVHC related bands.
2) Short-lived project of former/present members of Crainium, Crom-Tech, All Scars, Emergency, and Metamatics, circa 1996. They released 2 recordings, SENIOR YEAR WAS BEST (45), produced by Guy Picciotto of Fugazi (available on Slowdime and Dischord Records) and THE MAP (12" in 1997 on the Portland, Oregon based label Archigramophone Records.).  Meltdown was four teenage girls, Amy Heneveld, Sonia Brenner, Fiona Griffin and Raquel Vogl, got together in Washington D.C. in the mid 90â€™s and made some tough sounds.
3) Meltdown from Pittsburgh, PA is a radical mix of 85-89 era Megadeth and Slayer of the Reign in Blood period. The band relocated from their native Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Los Angeles, California in the fall of 2007. The band changed its name to Mantic Ritual in September 2008 to avoid confusion with other bands called Meltdown. They are re-recording their debut album for release on Nuclear Blast early in 2009 under the new moniker, however in late 2008 they moved back to their hometown of Pittsburgh.
