Saint DX is the epitome of the contemporary crooner. A French singer, songwriter and producer, his style reveals an obsession for love and an exacerbated sensitivity.

Raised in the Buddhist spirituality of his parents and rocked by the soundtrack of The Big Blue, Aurélien Hamm tells us about the fragility but also the beauty of our love stories, and the reincarnation of our wounds in the repetition of our days.

Oscillating between English and French, swaying bass and ethereal layers, auto-tune and nakedness of the voice, he cites Sade as well as Mylène Farmer, Better Person, Kanye West or Prince among his influences.

Since 2018, he has released 3 singles (Regrets, First Fantasy and I Still Care), accompanied Charlotte Gainsbourg on stage and played a number of her opening acts. He has just put the finishing touches to SDX, a 9-track EP available on Cracki Records and Because Music. He will be in concert in Paris at Point Éphémère on 12 December 2019. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Saint+DX">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
