Speedy Ortiz is an American indie rock band from Northampton, Massachusetts.

The band originated in 2011 as Sadie Dupuis' solo project while she was teaching songwriting at a summer camp, recording her own material using her laptop.

"Resurrects the floppy-stringed guitar dissonance of old-school Boston bands like Kudgel and Swirlies, or Rob Crow from Pinback's predecessor Thingy, who forged similar anti-anthems out of the grimiest chords." - Boston Globe. TL;DR. DTF. 10" EP, 'Sports,' out on Exploding in Sound Records. 'Major Arcana' out on Carpark Records; 'Real Hair' EP followed in February 2014.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Speedy+Ortiz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
