Lumbar is an American metal supergroup formed by Mike Scheidt (YOB, VHOL), Tad Doyle (Tad, Hog Molly, Brothers of the Sonic Cloth) and Aaron Edge (Himsa, Iamthethorn, They Shall Take Up Serpents, Rote Hexe, Brothers of the Sonic Cloth). They got together at various points between May and July of 2013 at Tad Doyle's co-owned Witch Ape Studio at Seattle, USA to put together the debut release, "The First and Last Days of Unwelcome", which is due out November, 2013 on Southern Lord records, for whom Aaron was the Art Director for a number of years. The record was mastered by Brad Boatright of Portland’s Audiosiege.
The project is the brainchild of Aaron Edge and it’s genesis and essence is in his struggle with multiple sclerosis with which he was diagnosed in the beginning of 2013. He wrote all of the music and lyrics, Mike Scheidt helped with arranging and also contributed vocals, and Tad Doyle also did vocals and mixed the album. The artwork on the cover and booklet of the debut record is done by Daniel P. Carter. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lumbar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
