This is the only available info on Undimensional, from the letter to UHR accompanying their demo:

Hails!

Enclosed is the demo from the Entity known only as Undimensional, We
play astral black metal exclusively: inspired by the music of
avatars of the Other side of existence such as Darkspace; Rev. Kriss Hades,
Tenebrous; and Crimson Moon...~ WE CREATE GATES INTO OTHER WORLDS THROUGH
THE CRYPTIC TECHNOLOGY OF THE / NINE ANGLES \ ! There is nothing else We
require to communicate Our desires and to open the door to things NOT OF
this world of Horrors! We utter these TRUTHS ExclusiveLy in the inspired
YUGGOTHIC TONGUE that accompanied the Original communication of the NINE
ANGLES. We eschew ~trivialities~ like pseudonymns, UNINFORMED and
pretentious track titles, trite band logos, worthless web sites. It
is of NO CONCERN who
We are, where
We are from, or how
We *choose* to appear! All that
matters is that WE have a suitably underground way of spreading Our
ONYX PLANE OF DESTRUCTIVE ART to those worthy of the experience, and
that FOR THEIR OWN safety the worthless aspects of humanity are not
"allowed" to endure / IT \.

There is a HIDDEN KEY here for those who would understand. This notice
CANNOT BE ALTERED if posted to explain the ENTITY OF THE UNDIMENSIONAL.
