Rotting Mutilation is comprised of Mördaren Jon, as well as Jagaren Ed.  Composed solely by Mördaren, the music is heavy and may take a few listens to fully soak in because of the speed of a few of the audio passages.  With lyrics covering many different topics, this is not your typical goremetal, nor is it composed of chuggy breakdowns.  This is the future of metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rotting+Mutilation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
