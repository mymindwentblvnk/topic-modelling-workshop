Leah Chisholm aka LP Giobbi is a producer-DJ-music director-synth warrior goddess born in Oregon and based in LA.

When she’s not collaborating or touring with the likes of Sofi Tukker, Jax Jones, Hotel Garuda or Autograf, she’s co-founding burgeoning publishing companies and touring parties (Animal Talk Collective; Sofi Tukker's label), heading up a thriving non-profit organization to address the lack of representation and equity in electronic music (FEMME HOUSE; with her friend & co-manager Lauren A. Spalding), acting as North American Music Director for W Hotels, and running her namesake apparel business (GIOBBI). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/LP+Giobbi">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
