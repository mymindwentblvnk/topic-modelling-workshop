Orphan Project was conceived in November of 2001 in Abingdon, MD, when vocalist Shane Lankford approached John Wenger with an idea to create a concept album on physical and spiritual adoption. Thus, the process began to create a soundscape that could handle the lyrical depth of trying to find an identity that Lankford, himself being an orphan, was searching for. With influences such as Kansas, Yes, Peter Gabriel, Dream Theater, and U2, they released their debut album entitled "Orphan Found" in June of 2003, with production being handled by keyboardist Tony Correlli, and a live string ensemble arranged by Wenger. With the addition of several live musicians, they would also go on to play shows regionally including an opening slot for Spock's Beard. "Orphan Found", went on to move 3,000 units without the support of a record company

Between 2003 and 2005, the band was to go on hiatus, with Lankford lending his vocal talents to Trinity Records founder Rob Perez's band Visual Cliff, and himself and current Orphan Project bassist Bill Yost working on another project entitled "Fall of Echoes". In 2008, Orphan Project would reform and return to the studio to create a 19 minute EP entitled Orphan Project II, which would be a 4 song EP featuring three brand new originals, as well as a Pink Floyd cover.

In the summer of 2008, NePlusUltra would take interest in and sign the band on to release a new full length, which would be "Spooning Out The Sea".

Orphan Project's material incorporates elements that fans of hard rock, progressive rock, metal, and even adult contemporary will be able to appreciate. Current band members consist of vocalist Shane Lankford, bassist Bill Yost, guitarist Scott Spivey, and drummer Tim Kehring. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Orphan+Project">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
