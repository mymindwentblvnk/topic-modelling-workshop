Suicide Attack is the new thrash metal sensation from The Netherlands!

Riding the waves of the North Sea Area thrash metal phenomenon that has taken the lowlands by storm during the last decade, this furious four-piece will compel you to mosh, bang and party like it's 1989!

While Suicide Attack only saw the light in 2013, its members have been shredding the stage extensively with previous or current ensembles, including 2011 Wacken Metal Battle finalist X-tinxion, Stigma, Chaos and Bestial Devastation.
