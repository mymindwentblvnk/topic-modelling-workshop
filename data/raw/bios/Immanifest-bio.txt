Taking their name from the absolute, pure, & formless ground of being from which creation and manifestation arise. IMMANIFEST. Emanated out of Tampa, FL in 2008. Influenced by their home town's rich history of metal, IMMANIFEST formed to fuse together their own vision of 21st century extreme music. Combining huge sounding orchestral/synth arrangements, heavy and melodic guitars together with intense "Death Metal" style vocals, and devastatingly fast paced and precise drumming. IMMANIFEST presents their own unique style of Symphonic Black/Death Metal. The six seasoned musicians of IMMANIFEST  plan to lead the way for a Floridian Symphonic Black Metal revolution, revealing themselves as an up and coming force to be reckoned with to even their great Scandinavian predecessors.

In the fall of 2009, IMMANIFEST entered the famous Morrisound Studios to finalize their debut EP "Qliphotic" and in their very young career as a band, they've shared the stage with acts such as Maylen & The Sons of Disaster, Deicide, Tyr, Korpiklaani, Order of Enead, & Kult ov Azazel. Transmigrating the soul of Black/Death Metal and Orchestral/Soundtrack quality music, "Qliphotic" presents itself as the first and promising emanation from
the black womb of creation that is...IMMANIFEST.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Immanifest">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
