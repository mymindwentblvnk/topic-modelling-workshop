There are multiple acts with this name:

1) Salem (sometimes stylized in all caps or as S4LEM) is an American band from Traverse City, Michigan. Considered to be one of the pioneering acts in the witch house genre, Salem's sound contains elements of electronic, chopped and screwed, dark ambient, hip-hop, shoegaze, trap, and crunk. The band was formed in 2008 by Jack Donoghue, John Holland, and Heather Marlatt. They remained active up until 2012; releasing several mixtapes, EPs, singles, and remixes, as well as their debut studio album, King Night in 2010. 

They briefly returned in 2016 on Wolfgang Tillmans' "Make It Up As You Go Along - Salem Remix", before another 4-year period of inactivity. In May 2020, Salem returned once again with another mixtape, Stay Down, and released their second studio album, Fires in Heaven in October that same year, 10 years after their debut. 

A few weeks prior to the release of Stay Down, Marlatt posted a photo to her Instagram page, alleging that the other 2 members of the band were "attempting to force her out". She has not been featured on any of Salem's output since 2012.
