Murat Nasyrov was a Kazakh-Russian pop singer. He was born in Alma-Aty, Kazakhstan and later moved to Moscow, Russia where has started his musical career.

He was the fifth child in a musician's family and didn't plan on becoming a singer.

He won his first award in Yalta (Crimea) in 1991. He won the competition but it didn't mean much deal of popularity. He started working in a restaurant as a singer, there he met A-Studio - the famous Russian-Kazakh pop-group. The band helped Murat meet important people and in 1997 he released his first album "Kto-to prostit" (rus. Кто-то простит, "Someone would forgive"). The album included his most popular hits, "Malchik hochet v Tambov" (rus. Мальчик хочет в Тамбов, "The Boy Wants to Go to Tambov") - a Russian cover of "Tic tic tac" by Brazilian band Carrapicho).

Altogether Murat released five albums. He might have made more, but fate had other plans: he died on January 19, 2007, after falling from the balcony of his fifth-floor apartment. He was 37 years old and left behind a wife and two children, along with his old kind songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/%D0%9C%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82+%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%8B%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
