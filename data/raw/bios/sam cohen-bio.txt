Sam Cohen (born Samuel Benjamin Cohen) is an American rock vocalist, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, artist, and producer based in Brooklyn, New York.

After Apollo Sunshine called it quits in 2009, it looked like Yellowbirds would become Cohenâ€™s solo outlet. But after that project became a real band and then similarly dispersed last year, Cohen decided to release music under his given name for the first time. Though he plays just about all the instruments on Cool It, the sound is right in line with those two Yellowbirds releases. Gone are vestiges of the rootsiness Apollo Sunshine incorporated in early albums and the kitchen-sink aesthetic the band explored on parting shot Shall Noise Upon. With Yellowbirds and now this solo release, Cohen has settled comfortably into vintage, sunny psychedelia. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sam+Cohen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
