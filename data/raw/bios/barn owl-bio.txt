Barn Owl is an experimental/psychedelic drone band from San Francisco, California, USA, formed by Evan Caminiti and Jon Porras (of Elm) in 2006. Critics have noted the influences of Alice Coltrane, Keiji Haino, Black Sabbath, Pandit Pran Nath, and Tony Conrad on the duo's music.

Porras and Caminiti, both guitarists, who met while attending San Francisco State University in 2005 and recorded music at home while working on other musical endeavors, began releasing music in 2007. In 2010, they signed with Thrill Jockey, and released the first of three albums for the label. That year, they also founded their own boutique record label, Electric Totem.
