OOIOO (pronounced "oh-oh-eye-oh-oh") is perhaps the best known side project of Japanese rockers Boredoms. An all-female group based in Japan and founded in 1995 by Boredoms drummer (and sometimes trumpeter and vocalist) Yoshimi P-We, OOIOO shares much of the musical style of the better-known Boredoms. OOIOO are more accessible than Boredoms and tend to lean towards the more melodic space rock sound characteristic of Boredoms' later works.
