Take Heed! Negator are back with a vengeance!

Black Metal is dead – long live Negator! Hailing from the halls of eternal frost, Negator forge their relentless Black Metal in Germany’s eternal Metal-City: Hamburg. In times, when Black Metal is dominated by mediocrity and bands, which celebrate their stylistic und musical deadlock, Negator return after almost five years more passionate than ever. True to their deathless credo “Lined up to create values – made to be indispensable!” (From ‘Eisen Wider Siechtum’ of DIE EISERNEN VERSE, 2005) this Black Metal-armada has brought in an album which is second to none. In order to meet the essence of “big is better“, Negator once again chose sound expert Eike Freese (Dark Age, Callejon amongst others) and entered his EiKey Studios in Hamburg so as to provide the best and most relentless sound possible. Think of Belphegor’s BONDAGE GOAT ZOMBIE and Behemoth’s EVANGELION. Their third album, which is literally entitled PANZER METAL, comes up with a monster of a sound that is simply top notch. Negator play unique Black Metal which is rooted in the very Nineties, when Black Metal still was not rendered effeminate and construed neatly.  Negator’s quintessence is the spirit of Nineties Black Metal clad in a 21st century sound.
