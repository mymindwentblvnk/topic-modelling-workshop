Led Er Est emerged from a series of jam sessions that core members Shawn O’Sullivan and Sam De La Rosa started having in early 2007, using bass guitar, some cheap drum machines, and synths. They were inspired to record music largely by ’70s synth prog, and ’80s lo-fi electronic and industrial music. They recorded a number of songs at friend Will Burnett’s studio that fall. Their first officially released track was on the Wierd Records compilation, Analogue Electronic Music Vol II. Owen Hutchinson joined the band for their first live show at the Wierd party that December. In January of 2008, they released their first 7-inch, a split with Excepter member Jon Porkchop aka SSPS.

Throughout 2008 and 2009 they self-recorded their first album, Dust on Common, which Wierd Records released in Nov. of 2009. In spring of 2010, they toured Europe with Xeno and Oaklander, playing shows in the UK, Belgium, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Italy. Subsequently they released a 7-inch and then the May EP on Captured Tracks. Led Er Est did a brief west coast run with Soft Moon last fall and just played SXSW. On stage and in the studio Led Er Est create a thick wall of atmospheric soundscapes using vintage analog recording devices, samplers, and synths using sci-fi soundtracks and cold wave as reference points. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Led+Er+Est">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
