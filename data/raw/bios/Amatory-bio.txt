Amatory are a metalcore band from Saint Petersburg, Russia, who formed in 2001. The band won two awards at the Russian Alternative Music Prize in 2005 and has toured across Russia, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Moldova, Belarus, Ukraine, and Finland. Their main discography includes seven albums: Вечно прячется судьба (Fortune on the Run, 2003), Неизбежность (Inevitability, 2004), Книга мёртвых (The Book of the Dead, 2006), VII (Seven, 2008), Инстинкт обречённых (The Instinct of the Doomed, 2010), 6 (Six, 2015) and DOOM (DOOM, 2019).

When you are from the largest country on Earth, how do you tell your fellow citizens that you exist? That may have been the biggest hurdle for AMATORY, hailing from Saint Petersburg, Russia, which covers a mind-blowing 17,000,000 square kilometers. But through dedication and hard work, the band has become a very popular Russian act with fans in the capital, industrial centers, and even provincial towns miles from city life. AMATORY make certain everything about the band, their products, and the presentation are 100% perfect and according to their specifications. Their songs are meticulously recorded and mixed. Their album artwork is tweaked until the band is completely happy. And band members are very particular about how they themselves project the right image that says AMATORY. 

“…The guys from AMATORY are devoted to their craft and focused on work…” – Jacob Hansen, sound-producer of two band’s albums says. “…It is big as hell over there, which feels very weird when you hear nothing at all about them only 2 hours away on a plane” – Tue Madsen, a sound-producer of the band's album «VII», adds. As a proof of AMATORY professionalism, you can ogle a signature guitar designed by guitarist Александр [ALEX] Павлов, manufactured by the ESP Guitar Company – you can be sure that not every band gets asked to create a signature guitar model!

Radio or TV exposure has been the main ingredient for a breakthrough by every new artist, but AMATORY had very little media exposure to gain their devoted fan base of hundreds of thousands of Russian metal fans. All of this is a result of their hard work, playing about 350 concerts to date in Russia and surrounding countries. If you think about how Russia has resisted various conquests, you can't help but be impressed that AMATORY managed to conquer the Russian cultural landscape spread across such an expansive territory. AMATORY are very excited to take their music a step further in 2010 with an appearance at Helsinki Metal Meeting and Tuska Open Air, but even without leaving their home, they've gained many new fans by adding their songs to JamLegend online game platform and having 30,000 plays of their song in English, «Your Life In My Eyes», in first days! Dignity is still missing.
