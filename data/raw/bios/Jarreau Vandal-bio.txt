Born in Maastricht, raised in Amsterdam, Jarreau grew up in a musical family surrounded by cassettetapes full of Jazz, soul & funk. Growing up in the 90’s got him heavily into Hip-Hop, rock and R&B. Artists such as Jamiroquai, A Tribe Called Quest, Red Hot Chili Peppers and many more inspired him to get into making music.

Getting introduced to the drums at a young age gave Jarreau a different view on how music is made. His Grandfather (also a music producer) introduced him to the music production program Logic at just aged 16. Since then Jarreau was hooked and has never stopped producing ever since.

After becoming part of the Amsterdam based clubnight focused on new electronics “Wavefiles” as a resident DJ and promoter, Jarreau met a lot of great artists he admired. One of them ‘IAMNOBODI’ whom, after hearing his tracks and remixes, introduces him to Joe Kay one of the founders of the L.A. based label “Soulection” where he brought out his first ep called “the Jarreau Vandal white label”
