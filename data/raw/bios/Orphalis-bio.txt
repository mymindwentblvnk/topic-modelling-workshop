Orphalis is a Technical Brutal Death Metal band formed in 2010 by Morten (guitar), Danny (bass) and Kai (drums). Jens (vocals & guitars) joined the band a few months later. After a long search for a skillful vocalist the line up was completed with Dennis joining the band.

Orphalis stands for a relentless and technical breed of death metal, which combines creative
songwriting, furious drumming and brutal vocals. The lyrical themes deal with philosophical matter and differ from typical death metal topics.

The first 3-Song EP “Watchmaker Analogy” was recorded in 2011 an received a very positive feedback. The band is currently working on their first full length record, which will be recorded in April 2011 and released trough Show No Mercy Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Orphalis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
