There are multiple artists bearing the name Detonation:

1) Detonation is a melodic death metal and arguably thrash metal influenced band from Zeist, Netherlands, originally formed as Infernal Dream in 1997 by Koen Romeijn (vocals, guitar), Thomas Kalksma (drums) and Mike Ferguson (guitar). They've so far released one EP "Lost Euphoria" (2000), one promo "Promo 2001" (2001) and four full-length albums, "An Epic Defiance" (2002), "Portals to Uphobia" (2005), "Emission Phase" (2007) and most recently "Reprisal" (2011).

In the autumn of 2010, after completing "Reprisal", Otto Schimmelpenninck (bass), Danny Tunker (guitar) and Michiel van der Plicht (drums) left the band due to lack of time.

The band is on hold since November 2011. After long consideration Koen and Mike have decided to take a break from Detonation. Presently (2014) the band rehearses sporadically with Otto back on bass and a new drummer.
