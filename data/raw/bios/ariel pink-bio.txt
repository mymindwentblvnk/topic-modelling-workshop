Ariel Pink (born Ariel Marcus Rosenberg on June 24, 1978) is a musician who is based in Los Angeles. Pink has been recording his music on tape since 1996 but it wasn't until after he passed a CD-R to the New York-based band Animal Collective that his commercial musical career took off. He attended Beverly Hills High School in Beverly Hills, California. Later attending the School of Art at the California Institute of the Arts. 

Married to Alisa Daniels, July 2002 - they divorced in 2005. He lived with Geneva Jacuzzi for seven years until early 2011.

He has since caught the attention of various media sources, especially in the Los Angeles area. As most of his albums are self-made, many of them have never been heard by fans. The only albums which have been commercially released come from his "Haunted Graffiti" series and are thus the best known.

Pink produces and plays almost all of his own music, and is noted for creating drum sounds using primarily his mouth, and sometimes his armpits. His home recording technique gives his music a very lo-fi sound, to the point where new listeners may mistake the era of his music.

Pink cites R. Stevie Moore--friend, mentor, and "father of home recording"--as one of his major influences. He is sometimes associated with the New Weird America movement, and could also be considered an embodiment of 'The New Sincerity'. Pink boasts a cult following and endorsements from more widely known artists such as fellow Paw Tracks artists Animal Collective.

Aside from his music, Pink also makes semi-abstract and surreal grotesque drawings, which can be purchased from his unofficial website, ARIEL PINK haunted house, for a hefty price. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ariel+Pink">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
