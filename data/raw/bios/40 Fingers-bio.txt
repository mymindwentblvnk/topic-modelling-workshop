40 Fingers is an acoustic guitar quartet based in Trieste (Italy) and composed by musicians Matteo Brenci, Emanuele Grafitti, Andrea Vittori, Enrico Maria Milanesi, all coming from different music backgrounds and more than 15 years of experience in live shows.
The original line-up formed in 2017 with guitarist Marco Steff√® lasted until October 2019 when Enrico Maria Milanesi joined the band in his place.
These four guitar players are set on a mission to explore new galaxies of sound with a wide repertoire of original pieces and covers, which they perform in the fingerpicking technique and skillfully arranged for four guitars. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/40+Fingers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
