Ancient Plague was formed in 2007 by Gedaliah, he created this project to embrace his love for dark ambient music. in 2008 he put together a demo which was on the verge of more experimental ambient music. In 2009 Alexis joined Ancient Plague and has taken the band to new levels of music, they now play a combination of orchestral black metal, and ambient dark metal, with 
depressive black metal undertones.

The new style Ancient Plague has taken on will be thought provoking, cleaver and even more dark...
