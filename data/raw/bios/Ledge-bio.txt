There are two artists with this name:

1. Sludge/doom metal from Chicago, Illinois. Ex-Weekend Nachos

Bandcamp

2. Founded in 1999, Ledge is currently composed of Olivier MARTYN & his partner Pol√©rik ROUVIERE. Quickly, the Ledge's sound impose itself as a precursor of a new 80's feeling pop. Catchy voices, heavy synth-bass, electric-guitars, distorted analogue keyboards. This melting pot of influences provide a raw, dirty and dancefloor sound. Ledge have also remixed some of the finest artists like Culture Club, Muttonheads & Dax Riders. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ledge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
