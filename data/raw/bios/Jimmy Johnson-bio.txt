1) Jimmy Johnson (born James Earl Thompson in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on 25 November 1928; died January 2022) was an American blues guitarist and singer.  Born into a musical family (younger brother Syl Johnson became a soul star, while sibling Mack Thompson was Magic Sam's first-call bassist), Thompson moved to Chicago with his family in 1950. He began playing professionally with Slim Willis in 1959, changing his last name to Johnson, as did his brother Syl. As a guitarist he was influenced by Buddy Guy and Otis Rush. He played with Freddie King, Albert King, Magic Sam, Otis Rush, and Eddy Clearwater, among others. 
In the 1960s, he began to focus on soul, working with Otis Clay, Denise LaSalle, and Garland Green. He had his own group from the early 1960s, and by the mid-1960s he had released his first single. By 1974, Johnson had returned to playing blues, working with Jimmy Dawkins and touring Japan with Otis Rush in 1975.
His first solo albums appeared on MCM Records in 1978 and Delmark Records in 1979, when he was fifty years old. 
Tragedy struck on December 2, 1988, when Johnson was driving his band's van when it swerved off the road in downstate Indiana, killing bassist Larry Exum and keyboardist St. James Bryant. Understandably, Johnson, himself injured in the wreck, wasn't too interested in furthering his career for a time after the tragedy. But he was back back in the harness by the mid-'90s, cutting a solid set for Verve in 1994, I'm a Jockey. Every Road Ends, recorded in France and released on Ruf, followed in 1999. A collaboration with his brother Syl appeared in the summer of 2002, the cleverly titled Two Johnsons Are Better Than One. Brothers Live, recorded by Jimmy Johnson and the Chicago Dave Blues Band featuring saxophonist Sam Burckhardt at Switzerland’s Basel Blues Festival in 2002, arrived in 2004.

2) Jimmy Johnson (born James Franklin Johnson in Fordyce, Arkansas, on February 23, 1926; died in Los Angeles on November 25, 2000) was an American blues musician. He wrote the song "Don't Answer the Door", which was recorded by B. B. King. 

3) Jimmy Johnson (born Jimmy Ray Johnson on February 4, 1943, Sheffield, Alabama, USA; died September 5, 2019) was an American session guitarist, songwriter, engineer, and producer.
