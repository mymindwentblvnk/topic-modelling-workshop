Originally founded in 1991 during the peak of the original wave of death metal, Malformity play death metal reflecting the classic Swedish and Florida sounds of that era. This is not the cavernous variety the term denotes today, but actual old-school death metal. Further shaped by influences in grind, thrash, and doom, Malformity create a uniquely brutal and cerebral sound in the Atlanta metal scene. 

Malformity released two crushing demos in 1995 before dissolving indefinitely. The original members and newer recruits remained active in bands such as Regurgitate, General Surgery, Amoebic Dysentery, Dwarfophile, Disillusioned, and Neuroblast among others. In 2014, Malformity resurfaced from the ashes of Atlanta death metal band Lectures On The Apocalypse and released an EP in 2015. 

Playing select shows in the Southeast, Malformity have opened for notable acts such as Deicide, Misery Index, Nordjevel, Imperial Triumphant, Hobbs Angel of Death, Crowbar, and Sadistic Intent. The band has also shared the stage with several up and coming underground regional acts.

In 2021, thirty years after they originally surfaced, Malformity released their first-ever full-length LP, Monumental Ruin. The effort remained an old-school affair that has more to do with the original death metal scene popularized in Florida and doesn't very much rely on any developments from the intervening years since they formed. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malformity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
