Graveborne has been described as playing raw, fast, and even catchy black metal reminiscent of Marduk, Gorgoroth, Impaled Nazarene, early Emperor and Immortal. 2009 and 2010 saw Graveborne morph into a more hideous beast; Raato replaced Raivo on vocal duties, Graveborne performed an assortment of high-intensity live shows including Nummirock 2010, and then started to compose, rehearse and record the material for ‘Pure Negativity’ which was released in 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Graveborne">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
