Chaka Demus & Pliers are Jamaicans John Taylor (Chaka Demus) and Everton Bonner (Pliers) active together since 1992: one of the most successful acts in Jamaican music; the first Jamaican act to place three consecutive singles in the top five of the British music charts.  Both Chaka Demus and Pliers had established successful solo careers prior to combining their efforts. They are best known for their hits "Murder She Wrote" and "Tease Me". They had more commercial success with mainstream pop fans after their collaboration in the early 90s than either ever had in their solo careers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chaka+Demus+&+Pliers">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
