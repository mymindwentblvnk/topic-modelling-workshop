Arje is a Drum and Bass DJ and Producer from Darmstadt, Germany.

It's almost impossible to find words for Arje's still emerging musical life development. He's a sick computer-addicted freak, who started playing french horn at age 6 or 7. When he was 14, he started playing around with trackers under DOS (FT2, IT) - with 16 he bought a pair of turntables and started mixing hard techno styles and a bit of Drum&Bass... It took some years and many techno and acid clubbing sessions until he found out Drum&Bass was his final destination, but when he went to a live DnB session some years after where they dropped some serious hard DnB stuff, things were getting todays shape and he immediately knew what his lifeform was constructed for. Arje loves to hang out in pool and jam session music pubs where it's still allowed to smoke, tho he doesn't smoke anymore... However, he got a passion for TB-303's, good stereos, open source operating systems, sofas and old rusty bikes... It's still hard to really categorize him as an artist or dj as he goes for ups and downs in both, but he tends to start dj sets with some liquid, ending up playing the real hard rapestep shiz, while producing a lot of atmospheric Drum&Bass as well as some technoid repititive 175bpm stuff...
