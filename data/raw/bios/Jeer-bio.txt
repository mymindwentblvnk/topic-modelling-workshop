Jeer is a music project created by Dreamerion in the beginning of the 2011. In July a new member joined the band – MorfeusPuls, who is playing the bass guitar. He is known from a black metal band Morfeus, based in Chełmno, Poland. 24th of December 2011, Black Dominion Production has released the first Jeer's demo called "Burden of Life".

The assumption of this project is not to make a crystal clear sound, but to make a raw (but legible) message, which tells about these mental torments, which are irreversible and leads to only one direction… Jeer’s songs are very differential – once there are acoustic moments with clean vocals and once there are heavier moments, but that all maintain consistency. This project’s music is rather aiming on characteristic melodies and specific atmosphere than on technical performances. Despite fact that Jeer is a black metal project, it’s music is still somehow universal, so it’s going to appeal not only to fans of black metal genre. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/jeer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
