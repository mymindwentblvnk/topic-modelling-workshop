Abril is a band from Brazil. Abril means April. Why Abril? 'Cause april is the fourth month of the year, the month that falls begin. Also because there's four members in the band: Tavares, Kbca, Cassique e Bell. Genre: Alt Rock. All the lyrics is about everything and everyone. The music shows things that we feel in silence. The idea is become silence in music and that appears in compositions of Abril. Until the CD became ready, was six months recording on studio. The disco comes full of hard work with the production by Rodrigo Deltoro (ex Tequila Baby, Acusticos e Valvulados, Fresno) and the tecnique by Glauco Minossi (Daniel Rey, Ian McCulloch, Tequila Baby, Cidadão Quem, Ultramen), and special participation of the tecladist Lucio Dorfman (ex Enghaw), Lucas Silveira - Paraíba (Fresno) and Deltoro.
