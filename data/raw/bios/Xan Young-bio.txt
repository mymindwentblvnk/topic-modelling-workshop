Having spent years embedded in collaborative projects, Xan Young represents one artist’s unadulterated voice, the product of years of maturation in experimental pop and club music.

He makes a bold, heartfelt statement with first single ‘Passion,’ a song about the struggle to maintain balance and poise in the heat and pressure of a raw love situation. Sonically, the track thumps with a driving bassline topped by waves of crystalline soulful vocals and blazing synthesizers. Complete with the uplifting “Worthy” instrumental as a b-side, Young showcases his talent as both a songwriter and producer on this debut release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Xan+Young">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
