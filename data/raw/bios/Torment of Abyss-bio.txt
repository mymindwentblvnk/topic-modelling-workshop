Established under UNHOLY bloody night of the winter of 2005, the stalking of a hellish storm, and dark adaptation influence the honest sound and despicable called BLACK METAL, to appropriate not only musically ideologically, emerges an early proposal made at the old school time by CHAUX (guitars and vocals) and LORD CERNNUNOS (Drums) evoked as "Abyss." The band then inspired by great hell masters such as ENTHRONED, GORGOROTH, INQUISITION, and the true MAYHEM DARKTHRONE, performing compositions influenced by grim chaotic cacophony lyrics full of blasphemy, evil tearing guitars and drums. Later the band decided to join musical and philosophical forces with ASBEL (guitars and vocals), adopting the name "ASBEL" as identifying and generating, a new and hard work of restructuring which could unify the previous issues of two projects, offering a single unholy worship of a trilogy showing our deepest feelings and tendencies: hate, nihilism and misanthropy. Issues to highlight in this work are "THE TEMPLE OF RUIN" and "UNHOLY LAND" which express the contempt and indignation at the lies of a world full of envy that worships a false ... ... "Cried extolling honors for spirits of the infernal abyss reaching high levels of knowledge well hidden with the help of ancestral ancient rites of war and to purge any relationship with Christianity" Mid 2005, after the acquired knowledge and dedication to life, body, mind and soul with a more mature and honest sound, with noises unchristian totally Luciferian, its created new material as SHADOW LORD, SUBLIMINAL SUICIDE and MENTAL MUTILATIONS. After performing a local concert series, alongside bands like CEREMONY, CABRO SATANA, BLACK ANCIENT, OLD BLACK MAJESTIC, ESBBAT, BLACK ANGEL, DARK LEGION, DAIMONION, DAMFEEL and LAMENTOR, in 2006 by a series of musical and personal problems within the band, we decided to cancel performances and compositions trials, ending the work done. The band breaks up and the existence of "ASBEL” as a member is ended. The two original members continue with their individual projects in separate bands (Black devotion) and (Sobibor). By early 2008, CHAUX and CERNNUNOS meet again to continue their musical work. Following on the long road into the path of dismal knowledge, reborn "THE ABYSS”… ... For this alignment was counted with the participation of Miguel (guitars) Jean Pierre (bass), CHAUX (guitar, vocals) and LORD CERNNUNOS (drums). Some time they created new material, in which literary and musical composition was leathering by CHAUX and CERNNUNOS. It was determined to record 4 new songs but musical problems inside the band, recording on disintegrating. According to all the problems and impasses afore mentioned LORD CERNNUNOS, at the end of that year, most dedicated and totally convinced of the non-existence of friendship; just started from zeros and alone his work: “INFERNAL HATE FOR THE HOLY PEST”, picked fruit especially dedicated to the gods of chaos and destruction. Recorded tape format and thought, with the intention of honoring the classic sound "Old School Sudamerican Black Metal," playing homage to an ancient sound, unholy and pagan, full of infernal hate black metal is disclosed. “TORMENT OF ABYSS” deep and abysmal project produced and directed by LORD CERNNUNOS. For this recording we had the participation of LORD FAGGOTT (bass) and LEYROTH (voice) raw and honest sound (Pure fucking black metal old School) ...... invocation of knowledge, wisdom, hatred, occultism and misanthropy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TORMENT+OF+ABYSS">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
