2. Resonance played their first show in November of 2003 and existed until March of 2006. They released two demos and were rumored to be potential signees for a huge hardcore label out west. These guys play a style of melodic hardcore that recalls the sounds of Hot Water
Music, Lifetime, Kid Dynamite, and Avail. If you want to see how passionate and urgent  punk rock can get, you can look no further, because Resonance defines it. 
After a year off, we're ready to go for another round. Thanks for checking us out. We'll be playing out a bit while working on some new stuff. Streaming videos of what we thought was our last show are in the blog section. -Peace!
