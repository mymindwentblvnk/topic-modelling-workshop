Volatil is argentino-spanish duo Nicolas Hardmeier & Federico De Gennaro  : easy and efficient music, tricky riddims, deep basslines and alien voicing skills.

Volatil is born in 2003 in Barcelona when Nicolas started to produce his own tracks and invited other musicians to join the project. Volatil sound was born on its early form. Same year, Nicolas started touring in Europe as a member of "Go Lem System"  (www.golemsystem.com).

After 3 years and 2 CDs recorded with Go Lem System, Nicolas decides to perform live with Volatil, but is still looking for the missing ingredient. That's when he met Federico, who brings with his voice the color Nicolas wanted for Volatil.
Melting electronic music with reggae and ska, they offer an hybrid performance, part soundsystem, part live gig, a non-stop show where all the tracks are one signel and massive piece of dub.

In 2008, Volatil released their first album on french netlabel Les Cristaux Liquident (www.lescristauxliquident.org) 

They now work in trio with Satta B, a Bristol Dj, who adds a dubstep ingredient to the receipe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Volatil">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
