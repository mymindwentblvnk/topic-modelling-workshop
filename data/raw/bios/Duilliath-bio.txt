Duilliath  is a metal/gothic/symphonic band formed in West Lafayette, IN, United States in 2007.

Duilliath (dool-yeth) was started by Aliyah Davis in the fall of 2007 when she began searching for bandmates. This was the year Aliyah received a heart transplant, ending 2 years of constant hospital visits. Being reminded of her mortality, she knew that she had to start pursuing her dreams. There are no more excuses when you have been given a second chance at life. 

Seth was an immediate fixture in the band and brought a classic metal influence to the music. He was followed by Brian in the summer of 2008. Brian brought a great depth of musical knowledge to the orchestrations and beyond. Over the course of the next 2 years, other members would come and go, but these 3 stayed consistent. The lineup as of 2010 now includes bassist Bruce Ruhmann and drummer Chris Parker. Their journey has included playing with bands like Narrow House, Theophagy, Chemcoma, XeroSum, and more.

The long awaited first release from Duilliath will arrive in the magical year of 2013!

Duilliath has a fanbase that spans the globe. With a few live shows under their belts, Duilliath has impressed crowds with their natural stage presence and skill.
