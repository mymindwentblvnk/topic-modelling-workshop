1) Supra are a 2 piece Drum & Bass collective hailing from the UK, comprising of Shofer of the Youtube channel Skankandbass and Dimension, during the course of 2010 they have been honing their sound and now have two dance floor destroyers which are attracting major attention from names such as Hospital Records amongst others. 

First there is Smash, a hard hitting in your face track which has featured in things such as Danny Byrd's essential mix for radio 1 and then there is Arcade, a much more soulful joint that has been used by DJ Stanza at Hospitality events, these two guys are bound to get bigger and better as time goes on.
