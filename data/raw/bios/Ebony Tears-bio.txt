Ebony Tears are a Swedish death metal band who started out playing melodic death metal which was prevalent in the Swedish death metal scene at the time, bearing a strong resemblance to the latter-day sound of At The Gates.

With their final album, however, the band had begun to play a more modern thrash style of metal, very much akin to the band which formed in the wake of the demise of At The Gates, namely The Haunted.

Ebony Tears has since disbanded subsequent to the release of their final album, Evil as Hell in 2001. The album was also released on the Century Media Records label. All members went on to join Dog Faced Gods.
