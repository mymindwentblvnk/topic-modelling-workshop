Patchwork is singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, Jeremiah Nelson, and a rotating cast of collaborators.  In the spring of 2007 Patchwork released the “Work & Worry” Ep, a dynamic collection of indie-rock, pop and folk songs centered on Nelson’s thought-provoking lyrics.  "It’s Poetry and rust, modern precious pieces assembled in smart combos" as Left of the Dial stated.
During the solo Patchwork tours, the layered arrangements were transformed into orchestrated soundscapes using live looping, showcasing Nelson’s understated jazz guitar prowess.  Several thousand miles later Nelson is back in the studio writing and recording.

While growing up under the background training of classical and folk guitar, Jens Paulsen took a slightly different musical direction when he took the alias of "Patchwork." Consisting of the trio "Me, myself and I, " Paulsen combined an ambient flow of electronic/psychedelic overtones that could fit into the category of "new age, " even though that term is considered taboo by Paulsen. This sound is characterized on Patchwork's self-titled debut in 1997, followed by Odeon a year later and 1999's Marsmellow. Diorama appeared in mid-2000. - Mike DaRonco

Caroline Thon, saxophonist and composer from Cologne, has released her second album. She has changed the band’s staff on some positions but kept faithfully to her impressive musical concept.
´Inner Voice´ features a highly original choice of pieces, powerful compositions whose impact is reinforced by means of coherent colourful sound orientated arrangements. Thon is lucky having found just the right musicians for her project. The ensemble consists of improvising individualists who, if necessary, integrate themselves into the band’s concept without giving up their musical identity. Thus the composition or the soloist becomes even more powerful. Outstanding: female vocalist Junia Vent.
