EDAIN is a heavy/death metal band from Brno, Moravia. It was formed in 2007 by three ex-ABSURD CONFLICT members adding up new lead guitarist Pavel Jeřábek and bassist Zdeněk Záhora to the team.
The debut album "Through Thought and Time" was released along with the 29th issue of Pařát Magazine, professional Czech magazine dedicated to extreme metal. Besides their own material, EDAIN have also covered old thrash bands DEBUSTROL from the Czech Republic, and BOMBARDER from Serbia, proving their liking for the old school feel.
In summer 2011, the founding guitarist Martin Král is replaced by František Záhora, brother of the bassist Zdeněk, and the band goes on presenting new material live, including Exit Festival's Explosive Stage with BOMABRDER's Nešo appearing to sing "Novo meso" with them.
The second CD "The Sulphur Breather" came out on 17.12.2011, containing a compilation of new, re-recorded, covered, and live recorded songs.
The next regular album "Of Those Who Worship Fire" was released on 7.5.2013. In autumn 2013 the band gets back on stage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Edain">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
