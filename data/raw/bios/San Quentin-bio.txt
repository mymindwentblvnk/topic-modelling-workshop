San Quentin were a 4-piece band who existed in the early years of the 21st century, having formed in approx 1999 around the core members of Tom and Dave. Bassist Patrick moved to the UK from Australia having played for The Rockford Files, whilst and Mark was last to join having never played drums in a band before.
