Ray Keith started DJ-ing when he was 15. He has had varied tastes ranging from soul/jazz to Hip-Hop and Acid house. He says his influences include fellow DJ's Fabio, Grooverider, Colin Hudd, Johnnie Walker and Eddie Richards. He started at the Crazy Club which was held at the Astoria. At this time he also played at the Pet Shop Boys parties, every function they played at Ray would also play at. He has since moved on and played for almost every major event organiser including events as far as Switzerland, Iceland, Germany and Italy. He is a resident DJ at the Lazerdrome in Peckam, Milwaukees and the Paradise Club. All his work is handled by Groove Connection.

Travelling around the country to different events has not always been as smooth as he would like it. On one occasion he found himself travelling to an event in Yarmouth in a different car to his tunes. The other car got lost and he missed his set. At the Astoria one evening he was the last DJ to play. The stage layout was such that the DJ's were on a raised platform above the stage. At the end of his set he found himself stuck for half an hour whilst the person responsible for lowering the platform went off for a cup of tea!

Apart from his DJ-ing skills, Ray is also known for his excellent remixes. His previous work includes DJ Rap - Spritual Aura, as well as his own tracks Dubplate, Terrorist and Something I Feel.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Keith">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
