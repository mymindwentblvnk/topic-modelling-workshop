Heavy metal band founded in 2001, in the Argentine city of Concordia, Entre Ríos. The band was born from the ashes of two death/thrash metal bands; SDT (Sistema de Tortura) and Postmortem, in which the Ferrando brothers, Pablo and Alejandro, played respectively.

The band started out playing covers of Black Sabbath and Judas Priest, but soon started to compose their own songs. Throughout the years they had numerous lineup changes, but the core of the two Ferrando brothers, Pablo (Drums) and Alejandro (Vocals) and Matías "Bochi" Benítez (Guitars) always remained.

In 2004 they recorded and released their debut full-length album, "Herejías". From that point onwards the band played gigs in most venues in the city and also played in different Argentinean cities and occasionally in Uruguay as well. They've shared stage with acts of national importance such as Tren Loco.

In 2018, after years of arduous work and effort, the band released their second full-length album, "Piel de metal".

Current Lineup:
- Pablo Ferrando (Drums)
- Alejandro Ferrando (Vocals)
- Matías "Bochi" Benítez (Guitars)
- Carlos "Charli" López (Bass)
- Guillermo Spomer (Guitars) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/LATIFUNDIO">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
