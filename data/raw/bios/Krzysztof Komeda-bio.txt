(b. April 27, 1931 in Poznań, Poland – d. April 23, 1969 in Warsaw, Poland) was a Polish jazz musician and composer. His real name was Krzysztof Trzciński but he changed his last name due to Communist disfavor with jazz music.

Komeda was trained as an ear, nose and throat specialist. In 1956 he made his musical debut at a small jazz festival in Sopot, Poland. He first recorded in 1960 with Adam Skorupka and Andrzej Zieliński. The following year he began his relationship with Roman Polański by writing the music for his short movies and full-length "Knife In The Water". He scored several other films, including "Rosemary's Baby".

Komeda died in 1969 after an accident while working with director Roman Polański on his next film. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Krzysztof+Komeda">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
