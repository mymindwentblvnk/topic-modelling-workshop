The band was formed in the end of 2007 with HEAVY DRINKERS name, and after 3 years of activities and some changes in the line-up of band. In March of 2010 the band assumes the name of GRAVE REAPER. Even so, the intention always went to play Thrash/Black Metal, tends as a strong influence of bands as Sodom, Destruction (old), Bathory, Slayer(old), Kreator(old), Witchtrap, Nocturnal, Deströyer 666 and other. With all this, the band creates an own musical identity demonstrated in your letters and sonority, lifting all hate of metal from Maranhão. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Grave+Reaper">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
