Wet Leg is British post-punk duo Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers from the Isle of Wight. 

Teasdale and Chambers met at music college and initially played in other bands before coming together to form Wet Leg. The duo's debut single, “Chaise Longue", was inspired by Chambers’ grandfather’s chaise longue that she inherited. 

The duo is signed to indie label Domino. They performed at the 2021 Isle of Wight Festival. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/WET+LEG">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
