End of Days was founded in summer of 1999 in Bottrop, Germany, by Kevin, Frank and Thorsten.
They decided to create a new band that should not be subject to any limitation, neither musical nor lyrical.
On this condition EOD was set up to create a musical bastard of the most aggressive metal styles mixed with raw and powerful hardcore parts supported by an extraordinary aggressive voice.
With two old friends from a former band on bass and second guitar, it was February 2000 when End of Days hit the stage for the first time in Essen with Ryker's and released a 3-song demo CD the same year.
From this point on, EOD played a lot of shows (e.g. Ryker's, Hatebreed, Settle the score, Earth crisis, Madball, Death threat, Cataract, Heaven Shall Burn & many more), became well known for their energetic live performance and improved their musical style, which can be proved on their 2003 MCD-release "Hate Anthems" on spill the blood records.
The "Hate Anthems" MCD got almost nothing but good reviews and response from the hardcore and metal scene as well.
2004 was the most important year, which brought a new line-up (Olli and Dennis joined the band) and also the possibility to perform live on big festivals like the "Pressure Fest" and the "Eastpack Resistance Tour".
In January 2005 EOD went to Denmark to record their first LP called "Dedicated to the extreme", which was produced by Jacob Bredahl (Hatesphere) and mastered by Tue Madsen and that will be released on their new label Alveran Records in April 2005!!!
