" “Matsutake” is a kind of mushroom. “Taken” is a past tense verb that, in this application, implies alien abduction. Together these words form an embarrassingly juvenile name for an otherwise serious album. This LP, our second, consists of almost entirely live-tracked recordings aside from the vocals, some interludes, and occasional overdubs. As usual, it was recorded in our garage in Fort Worth, Texas. Thank you to the people of this great city for your support. Thank you to Colin Bolger for the fantastic artwork. Thank you for listening. Love. Enjoy.
