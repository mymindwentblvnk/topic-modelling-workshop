Kel Valhaal is the solo project of Hunter Hunt-Hendrix from Liturgy. Her quasi-improvised solo performances are a soundscape-oriented affirmation of ritual, repetition, chant and drone. Using looped voice as the primary vehicle, Hunt-Hendrix builds her sonic textures with the solemnity, austerity and patience of a lone individual. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kel+Valhaal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
