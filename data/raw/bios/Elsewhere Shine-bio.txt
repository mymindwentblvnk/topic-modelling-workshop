Elsewhere Shine is a Serbian musical project led by Marko SinadinoviÄ‡, keyboard and piano player from Prokuplje formerly known for his international ambient project . Musically and lyrically, Elsewhere Shine can be considered as a very warm band, emotional and introspective on a mission to fuse Avantgarde Metal and Ambient soundscapes into one coherent matter. For this musical endeavour, Marko recruited in October 2012 a very young but experienced guitar and bass player Bojan Vukoman from Novi Sad, widely known for his work with BANE and his main band Paimonia along with Bojana Panovska, mezzo soprano singer from Belgrade, a former vocalist of a Nightwish tribute band. This musical project will also feature many guest musicians and vocalists on a song to song basis.
