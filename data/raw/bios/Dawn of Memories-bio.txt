Everything started in 2011 when a group of friends, influenced by the Swedish melodic death metal scene founded the band "Violent Souls". From 2006 to 2010, the band did many concerts around northern Italy and self-produced an EP called "The Golden Palace of Deception". The meeting with Dysfunction productions (Fear Factory, Mnemic) brought to a more structured project so, with new songs and more evolved sounds, the five-piece combo renamed the band Dawn of Memories. The debut album “In the Sign of Sin” (mastered by Alessandro Vanara, notable with the Italian melodic death metal band Disarmonia Mundi), was released in 2011 under the label ZetaFactory/DysFunction Records. The band received a very positive critical acclaim from the press with a full-stars judgment from Metal Maniac (may 2011), a mention as one of the 2011 revelations in metal music worldwide and a review as best album by Rock Hard magazine in the October 2011 issue.
In 2011 the band decided to join forces with Soldiers of Sounds Booking Agency and started a promotional tour for “In the Sign of Sin”, sharing the stage with bands like Il Nino, Fleshgod Apocalypse, Sadist, Dark Lunacy, Eldritch, Trick or Treat, Pagan Altar, Empyrios and many others. After a forced stop due to the Earthquake that hit Emilia Romagna region in 2012, the band was also scheduled in 2013/2014 summer festivals, playing with, Michele Luppi (Whitesnake, Secret Sphere) and Noumeno. 
In 2015 the band recorded, once again with DysFunction Productions, the new songs that will raise hell on the new album “Unwritten Endings” and with its renewed line up is ready to come back live again!
