Abused Majesty is a Polish band playing a mix of death and black metal.

The band was formed in 1998 in the polish city of Bialystok by the drummer Icanraz and the guitarists Socaris and Łukasz.

So far, they released 2 demos (Thee I worship in 1999, Gods are with us in 2001) and two full length albums (Serpenthrone and ...so Man created god).

The lyrics on Serpenthrone are inspired by the Tome of the Ashes, regarding the occult history of the tribe of Regins (Scythians of Regia~Lechia), and it tells the story of the Serpentine king, the black fortress of the Nine Circles and the Burning Dragon Army (watch 13th Warrior to see it in action).

After releasing Thee I worship, Ghaez (Keyboard, Vocals) joined the band.
In 2002, one of the founders - Łukasz - left the band, but also two new members joined: Hal (Bass, Vocals) and Maar (Guitar, Vocals).
In 2005, Ghaez and Socaris left the band because of the lack of understanding between the artists and Rob-D (guitar) joined as a substitute. Later on, also Maar left.
