After a few years of talks about starting an All SCHOOL (punk/crust/grind/metal and everything they like band),with several interested musicians Martin, Rui, got to a starting point creating some songs, Johan was asked to do the vocals, few months went by and in the evening of 15/01/2013 at Music city Antwerp, after a few chats and beers with Rob (Bliksem) they decided to do some jam session together and see what happens. Marginal was born, a few songs were made, Rob did not had the time to combine two bands at the same time, so they talked to Steven and Timmy if they would be interested to pick up the drumsticks, and guitar to join Marginal. Meanwhile Martin, Rui and Johan continued to create songs and lyrics for Marginal, during this process the general concept about the music and lyrics was shaped. With Steven and Timmy in the band, the inspiration is coming from all directions, wich is used to create a soundtrack for total destruction !!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Marginal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
