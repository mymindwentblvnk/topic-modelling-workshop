Fall of Because was an industrial metal band from Birmingham, UK, founded in 1982 by Ben Green (bass) and Paul Neville (vocals, guitar, programming). Justin K. Broadrick (vocals, drums) joined them in 1983.

Besides Swans, they're one of the earliest incarnations of a heavy brand of rock-oriented industrial music. The band took its name from the Killing Joke song "The Fall of Because".

They released a demo in 1986 titled "Extirpate", but dwindled shortly after. In 1999, a compilation titled "Life Is Easy" finally came out, which gathered both studio and live material from that time period. In 1988 they split up.

Just as Justin left Head of David (another band he was playing drums for at the time) circa 1988, he contacted Ben about reviving Fall of Because. Ben agreed, and Justin decided to take over on guitars now, instead of drums. He felt that he knew what beats he wanted, and chose to use a drum machine to help out. This is what became Godflesh. 

Several tracks were the basis of future Godflesh songs, including "Life Is Easy", "Devastator" and "Merciless". Finally, a segment from a live portion of the LP was used as the 3-minute intro to "Love, Hate (Slugbaiting)" off of "Pure". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fall+Of+Because">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
