Image your first metalband back in the day that you and your friends started in pursuit of your heroes but only THIS TIME BEEING SERIOUS ABOUT IT.

All the members of Shredhammer walked down that road seeking their future as musicians touring the world and living their dream but had to let it go for some time due to someone not willing to take a risk.

WELL this band is formed out of Lifers and molded from the burning will to take a stand! Shredhammer is the unfiltered mixture of itÂ´s members influences all soaking into the songs and giving birth to a lovechild of possessed Metalcraziness and unbreakable Will.

Formed 2013, we recorded, produced and mastered our first Demo the same year while completing the songwriting for a full liveshow leaving us all to ready to TEST THIS BEAST ON STAGE!
Since the 18th of January 2014 the Demo "BEYOND YOUR REACH" is out and we are kicking some Live dates!
