Sense of Fall is a five-piece metal band from HÃ¤meenlinna, Finland. We play strong melodic metal with influences from various other genres.

The band has operated under the name Sense Of Fall since 2012, but its story can be said to begin in 2008 when guitarists Tony and Tero started playing together with various line-ups. Along the way, bassist Petri joined the band, drummer Janne was found from another city and the line-up was finally ready when Anni took over the vocals in early 2012. After months of hard work the band entered to studio to record their first demo CD. "Unchain" was relesed in January 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sense+of+Fall">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
