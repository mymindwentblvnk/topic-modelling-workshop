Palmer was born in 2000. The musical influences reach from Metal and Hardcore to electronic sounds and Jazz. Playing intense and honest music, Palmer has succeeded in gaining a reputation as an intense and powerful live act. In 2004 the first EP was recorded containing four songs and the video clip "who am i". In January 2007 Palmer recorded 8 tracks to be released on their upcoming LP by the beginning of April. These songs are full of power and strengh and nothing less than a fist in the face.
