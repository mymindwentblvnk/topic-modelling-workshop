Malombra is a decidedly dark band, with heavy gothic overtones and a penchant for Hawkwind's apocalyptic urgency. Their eponymous debut was followed by the more symphonic "Our Lady The Bones." By the time of their 2001 release, "The Dissolution Age," only vocalist Mercy remained from the original lineup. The Italian band has been compared to a baroque Devil Doll. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malombra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
