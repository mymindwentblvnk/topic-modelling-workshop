There are two black metal bands by the name of Pagan Wind: one from Brazil, one from Germany. 

The pure hatred inside human Pagan Wind comes with hymns evil and dark, for all who have the most cool and chaos within you, with all cold crushing the weak, and protecting the underground with sound waves of pure desperation, with the pure hatred of the weak pigs and Christians, who believe in a god, without any existence, in order also to end the fashions that infest our names. Negativity of the largest Pagan Wind. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pagan+Wind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
