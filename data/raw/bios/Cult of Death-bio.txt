Cult of Death is the glorious band which arise from the ashes of prog-stoner-cult band Tarkus. These are Kalle"Douglas", Kalle"Olle" and of course The Jesper "Jeppe-Bil" Pihl himself. Douglas plays the guitar, Olle the drums and the Bil plays the congas and does the growls and screams. 

In the early summer of 2006 they release their first full-length album called "Necropolis Inferno In The Age Of The Grotesque Slaughter" and it sold out!

Their second release did in a way sell out because some of tapes (the "Crocket Grinder", misspelled on the tape "Grocket Grinder") were too necro to be played in a record player so they were disintegrated. But the fans still got their 2 track singel (B-side: A Map To Death (Live)).

Besides this, one of their (the only) live act were recorded and produced in some few, rare numbers, named "Live In Ã…sa" after the arena's name.

Rumors of the gettogether were summoned in april 2007 at first and in july 2007 they were confirmed! Cult Of Death is reforming, MARK ONE members as "The Resurrection Of Cult Of Death" (Jeppe,Olle,Douglas) and is due to perform live and to record their second album. Name: "KNEE-DEEP IN GORE....AGAIN!!!" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cult+of+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
