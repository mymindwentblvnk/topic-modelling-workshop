Die Apokalyptischen Reiter (German for "The Horsemen of the Apocalypse") are a Metal band founded in 1995 in Thuringia, Germany and are signed to the Nuclear Blast label.

They incorporate Black-, Death-, Thrash- and Power Metal, as well as Rock and Folklore in their music.

Their original style (featured on their releases up to and including "Allegro Barbaro") consists of death metal blended with melodic compositions establishing a more epic mood than usual in traditional death metal. Folk metal influences were added in later albums, while the death metal influence has declined, resulting in less chaotic composition (often centered around a verse and chorus with a bridge and solo), more constant tempo, longer songs and some clean vocals, resulting in a more polished and accessible sound.

Concerts projected for 2007, commencing at the Antwerp Hof Ter Loo venue on April 27th, were announced as the 'Earthshaker Roadshock' tour in union with After Forever, Tarot, Finntroll, Machine Men and All Ends.

In 2008 followed their album "Licht" and their latest album, "Moral & Wahnsinn", was released in 2011!
