1) Characterised by a pop-infused, fresh and precisely clean production style, Kitoâ€™s music has received support globally from a number of leading DJs and producers. Having had her first completed tracks picked up by none other than Dubstep pioneer and figurehead, Skream, and released on his label Disfugured Dubz, Kito hit the ground running. 

Since her first release in 2009, Australian born Maaike Lebbing has gone from strength to strength. Having gained a lot of support and attention for her 12" and 4 track self-titled EP on Disfigured Dubz; Kito teamed up with vocalist and long term friend, Reija Lee and released a 4 track EP, 'Sweet Talk' on Diplo's hugely influential label, Mad Decent. Sweet Talk went on to gain a lot of support on UK's BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra along with Australia's national station, Triple J. The title track also sat comfortably at second place for a number of weeks in the Dubstep Beatport Chart.

Following on from Sweet Talk, 2011 has seen Kito further develop her partnership with Reija Lee. The duo remixed Spor's track Pacifica which was released on his imprint Lifted earlier this year. The Pacifica EP jumped straight to number 7 on the iTunes Electronic Dance Chart.

Kito's ethos is quality - not quality and her back catalogue reflects this worth ethic. With an already large and ever-growing fan base and encouraging articles and reviews from publications such as The Guardian, NME, Knowledge and In The Mix plus guest mixes on Radio 1, Triple J, Rinse FM amongst others - it is clear big things are in store for this young artist.
