Jessi Colter (born May 25, 1943) is perhaps best known as the wife of fellow musical "Outlaw" Waylon Jennings.

However, for a brief period of time in the 1970s, she was one of Country Music's best-selling artists in her own right, acclaimed for her million-selling 1975 Country Pop crossover hit "I'm Not Lisa" and several best-selling albums. She became known as the "first lady" of the Outlaw country movement.
