Catasexual Urge Motivation is a band from Japan that describes their music as "Cyber Grinding Death Metal". They are known for their Grindcore influence and are widely thought to be the creators of Cybergrind. C.U.M. was formed by the Kanai brothers in 1992 and released a long line of demos and split releases, but only one full-length album. The band changed their name in late 1997 to Vampiric Motives, but only released one recording under that name and disappeared from the scene shortly after. The compilation album Nekronicle was later released under their original name.

The Kanai brothers also played in noise projects Sadistic Lingam Cult and Algolagnia.
