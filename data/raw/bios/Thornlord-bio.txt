It all started with a handful of songs that Jake Vossler wrote.   He turned to a High-School friend named Martin Ayala that had a studio with his band, Psycho Cafe to record a CD.   Jake played all of the bass and guitar parts, sang and programmed a drum machine on this 5 song demo, in order to recruit some people to start a band.  

In the Summer of 2001, he met Danny Walker, the drummer in a band called Uphill Battle through a mutual friend and they started jamming.   Danny's proficiency on the drums brought new life to the songs.   After a few months of jamming and trying out various musicians they brought in Tony Hager on Bass, and longtime friends Pat Blackstorm (Vocals) and Martin (Guitar) to round out the group.   With the lineup complete they needed a name, and finally settled on the name Thornlord. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thornlord">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
