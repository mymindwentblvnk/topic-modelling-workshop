There have been a few incarnations of the band but it’s when Alex and Jess met in 2016 it fell into place. Before Pregoblin formed, Alex was a member of The Saudis, alonsgside Lias and Nathan Saoudi, and Jessica is a producer and writer and has worked with members of Gorillaz, Fat White Family and Dinosaur Pile Up.

Pregoblin’s debut single Combustion is an incendiary groove produced by Alex and Jess and released on their label, Fnoord Communications. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/pregoblin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
