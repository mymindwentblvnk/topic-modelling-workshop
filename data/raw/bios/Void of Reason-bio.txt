Void of Reason (VOR) is Atlanta’s Premier Melodic Hard Rock/Metal Band. The group consists of veteran musicians of the Atlanta music scene with over 20 years experience playing a variety of Atlanta area venues including The Masquerade, Sweetwater, Baja’s, Sidelines, and many more. The band has shared the stage with a number of national and international acts including Tempest Reign (featuring members of Iced Earth), Halcyon Way, ASKA, Twisted Tower Dire and will be opening for Jon Oliva's Pain (of Savatage/Trans Siberian Orchestra fame), White Wizzard and Icarus Witch in October. VOR has also been featured on Atlanta's biggest rock stations including Project 96.1 and Rock 100.5. VOR's current recordings include their 2009 self-produced, melodic hard rock/metal debut as well as a brand new 2010 release titled "Time For Change". Each album has received glowing reviews from a number of international fanzines and websites. Both albums feature a conglomeration of dynamic fist pumping power rock riffs, progressive melodies, eerie ambient tones and soaring vocal harmonies. With highly popular tracks such as "Slow Motion Crash", "When Worlds Collide" and "Drama Queen", VOR is destined to see rapid growth in their fanbase as they continue their aggressive promotional and performance schedule.
