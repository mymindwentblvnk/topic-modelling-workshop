Lunar Gate was formed in 1996 by Emmett Rees in Arklow, Ireland.
The band released three demos, two EPs and one split with their countrymen Mourning Beloveth.
Emmett Rees was also behind a black metal band called Cernunnos and he briefly played guitar for the band Crom.
He also played session keyboards for Paul Kearns band, Arcane Sun, on their "Eden Eclipsed" demo 
and did a couple of gigs with them as a bass player.
Emmett was the main man behind Lunar Gate but he also had some guest appearances on a few of the tracks, 
at least on the two first demos of the band, featuring, among the others, Paul Kearns (Solstice, ex-Arcane sun) 
and Máirtín Mac Cormaic (ex-Waylander). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lunar+Gate">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
