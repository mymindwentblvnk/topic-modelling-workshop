UNCHAIN were formed in Kyoto in 1996. Tanigawa (vo&gt), Tani (ba), and Yoshida (dr) were classmates in their junior high school. Later, Sato (gt) who was their junior, joined the band. As high school students, they did cover songs of various bands like: The Blue Hearts, LUNA SEA, L'Arc~en~Ciel, even they did cover of all Hi-Standard's songs before they began to compose their original songs. In few years they moved into Osaka and began playing live gigs there. 

Taking influence from jazz, blues, fusion, soul, funk, rock, pop to groove, with a high pitched back up singer and a milder one for a frontman it really helps the band with vocals, as does the great work they do on the songs instrumentals. They released their first mini album "the space of the sense" in 2005 and the second one "THE MUSIC HUMANIZED IS HERE" in 2006. 

In 2007 they went major (under AVEX) and released some singles and full albums. In 2011 they decided to quit from AVEX and started their own label "STYLE_MISSILE". In the end of 2014 they went back to major (under Nippon Crown).
