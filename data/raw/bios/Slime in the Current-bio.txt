Slime in the Current is an American black metal group formed in 2006.  Pissed on Resurrectine, the debut album, is a mixture of technical dark and experimental black metal. Their lyrics deal with anti-Christian themes, war horrors, and topics of acute bleakness.  The three-piece consists of Null on vocals, Stowt on guitar (and bass on P.O.R.), and Ajax 7 on drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Slime+In+The+Current">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
