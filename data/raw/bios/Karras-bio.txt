Excerpt from the German Karras MySpace:
KARRAS is a mixture from different cultures just like the band´s homebase Berlin. Shouter Devrim (ex-Disrespect/Devilinside) has his roots in Turkey, guitarist Ela (ex-Shred/Dresh-A-Peel) imigrated from Persia in the late 80ies, bass player Corinna (ex-Acusado) is of Jordanian descent while drummer Sabine (ex-Shred/Dresh-A-Peel) hails from the Ruhr Basin.

KARRAS, founded in December 2004, cover the musical grounds between Thrash/Death Metal and Hardcore. The band´s live debut was a support show for Hatesphere at the Knaack Club in Berlin in October 2005.

A 4 track demo was recorded and mixed in the band´s rehearsal basement. KARRAS does not appeal to the typical metal clichés neither in terms of appearance nor musically. In September 2006 the band recorded their first album which will be released in Mai 2007 (Maintain Records). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Karras">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
