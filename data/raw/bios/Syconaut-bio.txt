Syconaut was formed as a band in Skövde, Sweden the summer of '99 by consistent taste for music. 

2005 started off with some shows in smaller venues with other unsigned acts, but they were always really crowded. This year we wanted to take it to another level. "Fragrance Of Decay" from "Geodesic", were sent to P3 Demo. This program were held once a week playing songs from unsigned bands, and after a half year they used their air-time to choose the best songs they had played. Our song was one of those. 

"SOLACE" is Syconaut's latest contribution, it was recorded during the winter and spring -05/-06 completely by ourselves(including mixing and mastering). On this ep it feels like Syconaut has evolved to another level with more dynamics and more harmonic, without (in our opinion) loose any aggressiveness or substance.

2007 was a great year!!! Imagine play Sweden Rock Festival and Metaltown the same year. WE DID! Got signed by Ilumnirec and started to work on our debut album. 



"Burst Into Life" was released 20th of March 2009. A new step, a new era. "Burst Into Life" is a twelve piece aggressive-metal debut album that you do not wanna be without. The album was recorded during 2008, produced and mixed by David Holgersson and Syconaut. Göran Finnberg mastered "Burst Into Life" and art cover made by Axel Widén.
Syconaut celebrate 10 years anniversary as a band but since 2005 has Syconaut been in current constellation.
