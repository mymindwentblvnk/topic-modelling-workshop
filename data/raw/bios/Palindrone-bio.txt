BIO
Hailing from a scene ridden with breakdowns and pop punk choruses, Palindrone; consisting of long time Prog/Tech Metal fans, John Ritrovato and Neil Schneider (ex-Dawn Of The Hero) hope to bring back the word METAL into Metal. They are taking the old school vibe and putting it into a new school feel, with influences consisting of many different genres of metal from Meshuggah, Pantera, Opeth to Death. Palindrones music is a breath of fresh air to a copycat music scene. They don't plan on being the next big thing, or starting clicks or fads, they just care about doing one thing; making the music they want to make, and spreading it around to ears that fiend for it. So if you're ready, take a listen.

Palindrone will be releasing their first EP in early 2013
