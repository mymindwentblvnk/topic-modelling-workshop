Seabear is an indie folk band from Reykjavík, Iceland. Although hailing from Iceland, they sing primarily in English. Seabear started in 2000 as Sindri Már Sigfússon's solo project and then turned into a band when Sindri was asked to open for The Books in Berlin. Never having performed his songs live, he asked two of his friends, Guðbjörg Hlín Guðmundsdóttir and Örn Ingi Ágústsson, to join him. After some time playing live and practicing together, they both decided to join the band. The current participating members are: Sindri Már Sigfússon, Uðbjörg Hlín Guðmundsdóttir, Ingibjörg Birgisdóttir, Halldór Ragnarsson, Örn Ingi Ágústsson, Kjartan Bragi Bjarnason & Sóley Stefánsdóttir.

Their music is subdued and mellow folk pop, with hints of piano, violin, acoustic guitar and atmospheric vocals, all carefully squeezed through a lo-fi filter.

They released their first full-length album, The Ghost That Carried Us Away, in Autumn 2007 under Morr Music. Sindri also has an solo-artist EP under the name Seabear entitled Singing Arc EP.

Seabear has announced, via their myspace, that they are working on a new album which they hope to release in February or March 2010.
