Vomit Spawn are a grindcore band from Florida, USA, originally based in the Tampa Bay area.  Formed in 1993 between 3 high-school friends: Mark - guitars, Tony - drums, & Ern - vocals. The intention was simply to play extremely fast & offensive music and have fun. Shortly after forming they added Aaron (another HS friend) on bass. The "Fetal Lust" demo was recorded later that year and met with raging reviews from all over. Some praised it for being extreme grind and others trashed it for being sexist & homophobic; either was fine. The band played a few shows around Florida which earned them the reputation of violent and chaotic live performances. Sometimes this was true other times it was extremely exaggerated. A performance at a house party was recorded and released as the "Bootleg From A Keg Party" tape in 1994. Another recording was completed in 1994 which wouldn't be officially released until 1998 as a split 7" ep with Australia's Viscera. In late 1994/early 1995 the band parted ways with Tony over various personal and musical differences. A few shows were played through '95/'96 with Brian of the Jacksonville grindcore band Coprophilia filling in on drums. These shows actually became the most infamous performances including the "Brass Mug riot" and "Big Gasoline Cycles" shows. The band never officially split-up but was on hiatus until 2000 when Josh (Scab Maggot, Cursed Ruin) joined on drums. The band went on as a 3pc with no live bassist until 2005. A split 7" with South American goregrinders Lymphatic Phlegm was recorded in 2001 and released in 2002. The band continued playing a few sporatic shows over the next few years. One show was recorded and released as a split 7" with Maryland's Magrudergrind in 2004. In late 2004 the band released the mcd "Diabolical Detention", and traveled to Illinois to perform at the Central Illinois Metalfest. 2005 saw the band relocate to Jacksonville, FL. The band continued playing shows, though rarely, through 2005 & 2006. They were part of the 1st & 2nd Florida Grindathon death/grind fests ('05, '06). A live bassist, Dave (Dead Flesh), was added in 2005.  They are currently on hold. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vomit+Spawn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
