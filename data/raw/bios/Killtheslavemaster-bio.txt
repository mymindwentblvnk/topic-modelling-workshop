killtheslavemaster, formed in 1996 within the Milwaukee region, is a synthesis of metal, hardcore, and thrash music with a range of transforming ideas over the years. stemming from early / mid-90s hardcore where veganism and straightedge had relevance as doorways to questioning the concept of society itself which is, "...rooted in the discourse of domination. One might even say, with Levine and Levine (1975:177), that society is domination" (Ingold 1999).  Focusing now in theoretical approaches of anthropology, ecology, developmental systems, enskillment and hunter-gatherer perspectives each musician continues to explore, engage, coalesce and develop in their environments through this relational vehicle of song and music.
