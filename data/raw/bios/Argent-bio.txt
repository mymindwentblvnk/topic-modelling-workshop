Argent is an English rock band founded in 1969 by Rod Argent after his previous band, The Zombies, broke up. Argent's biggest hit was "Hold Your Head Up" (written by Rod Argent and Chris White). Released as a single in 1972, and taken in a heavily-edited form from the band's album "All Together Now", it was a Top 5 hit in both the US and UK, peaking at #5 in both countries. The original lineup re-united to perform at the High Voltage Festival in Victoria Park, London, in 2011 and did a short five-date tour as follow-up.

As well as Rod Argent, the other original members (most come from Hertfordshire, England) were drummer Robert Henrit and bassist Jim Rodford (later members of the Kinks) and guitarist/keyboardist Russ Ballard, who contributed to several compositions through the group's career (curiously some of Ballard's compositions became hits when they were covered by other bands, like Rainbow or Santana). When Russ Ballard left in 1973, his place was taken by guitarist and vocalist John Verity and guitarist John Grimaldi and there followed a period of intense recording and touring until the band decided to come off the road late in 1976.

The original Argent lineup re-united at the High Voltage Festival in Victoria Park, London, on July 25, 2010. They undertook a short five date concert tour in December 2010, with gigs in Frome, Southampton, Wolverhampton, Leamington Spa and London.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Argent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
