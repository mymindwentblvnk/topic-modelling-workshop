Black Aura is an experimental American based psychedelic post-industrial band with heavy shoe gaze, glam and new wave influences.  The band was formed in the spring of 1997 by Levi Dittebrandt (who writes, performs and produces nearly all of the band's recorded material) and has seen a revolving cast of characters fill out the live band.  Though the records have been mostly solo affairs, there have been two major studio collaborators over the years.  From 1998-2001 saw the full time addition of Jennifer Neslund with Nick Bevan joining in as the second full member in 2004.  

Black Aura records are often characterized by their deeply personal lyrics with the music reflecting the emotional charge (or lack thereof) behind each records set of themes with many songs hiding layers of melodies deep in the mix.  Common lyrical themes are death, paranoia, depression, anxiety and failed relationships.  Songs tend to mix traditional pop song structures with early industrial and shoegaze production templates.

"And yet among the despair, which Dittebrandt has in spades and is always willing to share, we'd all be very fortunate if pop music turned down this avenue."
-Seth Styles- (music journalist, musician)

"It carries with it the weight of a well educated and veteran Indy Goth act while having all the flavor of a fresh breeze on a dead scene."
-Doctor Raven (music journalist)

"Definitely one for those who like their doomed melancholia."
-Mick Mercer (music journalist, author)
