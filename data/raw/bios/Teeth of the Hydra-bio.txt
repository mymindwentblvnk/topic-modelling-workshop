From the ruins of Columbus Ohio come TEETH OF THE HYDRA, one of the burliest power trios to gallop out of the rust belt in recent times. TEETH OF THE HYDRA distill backwoods molten battery into crusty black metal riff electricity. Nautical death trip vocals and desert plague guitars transform 1970s' heavy rock hooks. Mean and raw is just how TEETH do business. Critics and fans have likened them to Celtic Frost, Melvins, Amebix and Entombed. Matt Miner is the throatman and defender of the mockingbird guitar. His voice moves from undead appalachian slang to Lemmy on fire howl. Godfather and earthquaker, Matt Bailey battles behind a wall of bass and tar. Hellish drum crossfire by Jamie Stillman(former master guitarist of The Party of Helicopters). His drumming matches Brian Downey finesse with the crushing retardation of Dale Crover. The TEETH live show is drenched in gross feedback and primitive hardcore energy. Death's deal is rolled. Cute girls break glass. Amplifiers catch fire. The volumehammer drops. Grown ass men "HESH THE FUKK OUT!" Fall 2006 sees the release of GREENLAND, the first TEETH OF THE HYDRA record with Stillman in the fold and their debut for TEE PEE RECORDS out of NYC. GREENLAND was produced and engineered by Sanford Parker (Buried at Sea, Pelican, Unearthly Trance) at his Chicago lair, Volume Studios. GREENLAND is a bleak story of living, fishing, freezing and drowning screamed from the edge of the arctic.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Teeth+of+the+Hydra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
