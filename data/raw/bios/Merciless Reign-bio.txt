Merciless Reign are an extreme metal band from Akron, Ohio.

In late 2010, drummer Chris Krucker and guitarist/vocalist Bill Paxton began jamming together on an occasional basis with no set goal in mind. As time progressed, a collection of random riffs began to take the form of song. Their practice routine became more organized and structured, eventually leading to a slew of material and a search for a second guitarist and a bassist. By this time, the year 2011 was nearing it's end. A few people managed to come down to the practice room to audition, ultimately leaving the two empty handed each time. While the search continued, the duo kept pushing forward with the writing process. Their drive strengthened, resulting in the completion of their first official song, "The Flames of Determination". In April of 2012, Bill and Chris asked their friend, Phil Trudeau if he would be interested in in joining them on bass. He accepted and introduced them to Stephen Wanca, who would soon become the band's lead guitarist. At last the lineup was complete and Merciless Reign was exorcized from the womb. The band is now solidifying material and plans to hit some stages by mid fall of 2012.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Merciless+Reign">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
