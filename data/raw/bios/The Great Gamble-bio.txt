The Great Gamble is a 4-piece progressive metal band formed in State College, PA with Al Joseph, Christopher David, Steve Michael, and Matt Weaver. 

Formerly known as Axeom, Al, Chris, and Steve joined up with Matt to form The Great Gamble after meeting at the University Park campus of Penn State University in the school of music. 

Prior to college, Axeom was recognized as the 6th best Christian band in the Assemblies of God National Fine Arts competition of 2006-2007 and made it to the national level the next few times as well. In 2006, Axeom was among the seasoned talent of progressive rock/metal groups Jacob's Dream (Metal Blade Records), Rivera/Bomma (Mausoleum Records), Orphan Project (Ne Plus Ultra Music), Ajalon (Threshing Floor Records), and Blissed (KR Records and Entertainment) at the Silent Planet Music Festival in Hughesville, PA. 

They opened the show for Jacob's Dream, who headlined the event. Between meeting the newest member of the group, Matt, the guys played countless shows around their local scene in Scranton, PA. A combination of inspirational and gloomy emotions are the subject of their music, bringing out a distinctive blend of moving passages, grooving rhythms, technical musicality, and hopeful endings. 

They are currently working on their first complete studio album entitled, "Book One", a concept album centered around a young man who is led by the Holy Spirit on a journey to redemption and understanding. The album is scheduled to release October 2011 and will be available for download and sale soon after. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Great+Gamble">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
