Acid Witch is a death doom metal band from Detroit, Michigan formed in 2007. They have three full-length albums, "Witchtanic Hellucinations", "Stoned" and  "Evil Sound Screamers".

Acid Witch began with guitarist/current singer Slasher Dave playing riffs alongside a tape of Halloween sounds and noises. Soon after, Shagrat joined playing bass and they began writing. Lasse Pyykk√∂ joined them, as the original vocalist, but left after their "Witch House" release.

The band now consists of Slasher Dave and Shagrat playing all instruments in the studio, and "Motor City" Chaz and Mike Tuff playing drums and guitar, respectively, live.

The band's musical style draws from many genres of music including death metal, doom metal, stoner metal,psychedelic music and horror films and their soundtracks such as the music of John Carpenter's Halloween. Some have also noted the influence of NWOBHM. Lead vocalist Slasher Dave has cited Pagan Altar and Witchfinder General as some of his influences. Due to the main overtones of the music, the band has dubbed themselves "Halloween metal". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Acid+Witch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
