Apathetic Discharge, say this and your mind conjures up foul images and thoughts, this is everything Apathetic Discharge is not. Formed in the winter of 2002 in Bremen, Georgia, USA, AD has been writing, recording, and playing countless live shows to secure their spot in the metal community. They have already released a full length independent album entitled "Confessions of an Unbridled Spirit: Bed of Roses" and are about to drop a live release in early ‘08 entitled "Inside the Heart of the Beast: Live at the Corner Cafe” and are working on releasing their sophomore concept effort in Spring of ‘08, "Hell's Eclipse”.  With a constant practice schedule and continuing to play live all over the southeast, it’s true what they say, hard work does indeed pay off. Drawing influences from many things musically, physically, mentally, and emotionally, AD has no limits when it comes to song writing, let alone playing. Main influences include the late and great Chuck Schuldiner (Death/Control Denied) and aspects from bands such as Cephalic Carnage, In Flames, Dream Theater, Atheist, Slayer, and Strapping Young Lad. Far from a new age “hardcore/metalcore” band, AD sticks to doing what they do best, letting the “metal flow”.
