There are two artists with the name Scherzo

1. A punk-pop band from Clayton California who released a 7 inch & CD  on Lookout! Records.
2. A prog rock band from Argentina.

1. Scherzo the punk band  were Clayton, CA combo. Their music had a strong personal political message tied to some moving post-hardcore-ish hooks. 

2. The other Scherzo had the most unique rock fusion sound of the last 20 years coming from Argentina. Beautiful lyrics and great arrangements from this quintet that realeased 4 albums from 1993 until 2003. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scherzo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
