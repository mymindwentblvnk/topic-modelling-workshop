At the end of year 2004, Benjamin DLJ (Vocals), Damien H (Bass guitar), Denis V (Drums) and Franck V (Guitars), each with experiences in extreme metal and rock bands decided to join their forces and give birth to Razorshape.

With influences such as Pantera, Soundgarden or Testament, Razorshape is obviously not willing to innovate into the world of metal music by adding destructured rythmics or other experimental nonsense to its art. Razorshape is all about sound, groove, and renewal of classical or oldschool metal music elements.

Having prepared its first album Live With It during more than a year, and after a recording session at the Drudenhaus studio, Razorshape is now ready to be unleashed right to your ears. Get ready for it, on may 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/RAZORSHAPE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
