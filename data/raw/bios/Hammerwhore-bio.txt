Vocalist/Guitarist Joe Gonzalez and Bassist Andy Gonzalez forged the band Hammerwhore in 2001. Reveling in the Speed/Thrash Metal of the glory days they merged influences from Sodom, Kreator, old Slayer, Possessed and Overkill with american hardcore/crossover like D.R.I., Cryptic Slaughter, Agnostic Front. Opening the proceedings with the demos "Devotion to Violence" and "Mercyless Brutality" in 2002. The demos secured a lable deal with Witches Brew Records for a 2004 debut album. The band went into Precision Studios in Corpus Christi, TX to record but due to delays the album wasn't released until December of 2005 in a limited pressing of 1000 hand-numbered copies. The band did various shows throughout Texas to promote the album, playing alongside Toxic Holocaust, Rigor Mortis, Deceased, and October31. Hammerwhore began working on a follow-up to the debut in 2007, but then took a year long hiatus for most of 2008. As 2009 begins we see the band return to the practice space to resume their work on next album. Expect a new demo soon. See ya on Stage!!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hammerwhore">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
