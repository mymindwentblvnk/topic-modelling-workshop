After parting with their former band, Emanuel Seis and Bernhard Lindner founded I Spit Ashes in February 2007 to show up with brandnew metalmusic.
At this time Florian Knauer played drums and after searching over one year for a stable lineup the first gig was played in Tauberrettersheim on 14. February 2009 with Benjamin Müller on bass and Benedikt Rathsmann doing vocals. On 27. March 2010 the band released their first output.... the „State Of The Art“ demo-ep and the release-show was already played with Daniel Lammich on the drums.
In this lineup the band started to come their dream nearer and so they made it to support Dark Tranquillity and Insomnium on the „Where Death Is Most Alive Tour“ and gained a lot of attention. But not only this! 2010 and 2011 were years where I Spit Ashes did some serious damage on stage with e.g. Nearea, We Butter The Bread With Butter as well as labelmates Farewell To Arms.
Finally, after almost 2 years of writing songs, 10 tracks for „Inhaling Blackness - Reflecting Light“ were selected to get them „on tape“ in Kohlekeller Studios, recorded and co-produced by owner Kristian „Kohle“ Kohlmannslehner during June 2011. This led to a record deal with Massacre Records and a support tour for ODS Saxon on their German leg of the European tour in February 2012. On 24. August 2012 „Inhaling Blackness - Reflecting Light“ will be available worldwide and the band is booked to share stages with e.g. Dark Funeral, Suidakra, Orden Ogan, Debauchery, Cripper... just to mention a few. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/I+Spit+Ashes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
