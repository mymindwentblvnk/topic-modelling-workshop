Toumast was founded in the 90's around Moussa Ag Keyna. In 1993, after years of combat and resistance, Moussa is severely wounded and evacuated to France, later joined by Aminatou Goumar. His encounter with composer, arranger and producer Dan Levy in Paris will be the starting point to the recording of the album.

It is a testimony about the years of combat and disillusion experienced by the Touaregs. The songs contain topics precious to the Ishumar: the nostalgia of the nomadic life, love, the bitter taste of exile and the criticism of politics.

Toumast's second album, Amachal, is available from Amazon France and will be distributed in the UK by Real World Records from 19 July 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Toumast">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
