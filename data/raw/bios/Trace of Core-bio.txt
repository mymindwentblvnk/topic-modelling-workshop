The TOC were born in the October 2005 and the original line-up included 3 of the 4 actual components of the band:Marco as Rhythm & Lead Guitar and lead vocals,Diego Lead & Rhythm Guitar and backing vocals and Andrea as Bassist. The three brings forth the group for about 2 years alternating for more or less time on the drums different names, up to find in Amedeo the actual drummer of the group. Principal influences arrive from great names of thrash like Metallica,Pantera and Anthrax, from melodic death metal bands such as Dark tranquillity,Arch Enemy Children of Bodom and from metalcore(you know Trivium and A7X of the first albums). The Trace of Core bring their repertoire of cover in different concerts in local area but soon they get tired and begin to create own stuff following a hybrid creative vein that rotates between death and thrash with some TRACE OF metalCORE. With some pieces to the asset that rocks,they are waiting to reach enough number of tracks to engrave theirs first demo...will see where the future will lead these 4 young musicians with talent...
