French death-metal band formed in 2007 in Sens.



Como Muertos is a French band with Spanish vocalist and lyrics mixing some extreme catchy music with false blood visual and attraction for old-school horror movies.

The history of the band started in 2007 with D on drums, El Doctor on guitars and bass and El Maestro on vocals. First aim being world domination and enslavement they quickly returned to a more appropriate goal of playing music and released the same year a first EP which received a very good feedback from the lucky buyers and journalists.

After an enlistment campaign, Como Muertos bribed Kronos drummer Mike to replace D. and corrupted Gorio (bass) and Adrien (guitar) to join forces. The band, gaining in efficiency and vigor, recorded another EP in May 2008 before entering the Drudenhaus Studio (Anorexia Nervosa,Ultra Vomit, ...) in January 2009 to record their first album, making the choice of a powerful but natural production true to their musical background.

After some successful gigs and a first album now achieved, Como Muertos have their bloody decors in the van and dismembered arms under the seats, ready to make any European stage their silly horror theater.

Let Como Muertos be a palliative against everyday gloominess!
