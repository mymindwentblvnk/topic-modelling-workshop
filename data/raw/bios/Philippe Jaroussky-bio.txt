Philippe Jaroussky (b. 1978) is a French sopranist countertenor. He is noted for a virtuosic technique of melisma, and for compelling and enlivened interpretations of baroque cantatas and opera. This has contributed to his unusual revival of repertoire.

According to La Terrasse, "this young singer with the tone of an angel and the virtuosity of the Devil has come into the limelight in only a few years as the great new French vocal talent." He received the 2007 best French lyrical artist. You can see his performance of a Vivaldi aria on youtube, here.

He sings well with Vivaldi violins (and ensembles). He received his diploma from the Early Music Faculty of the Paris Conservatoire. Since 1996 he has studied singing with Nicole Fallien.
