Lemaitre was started in Oslo, Norway in 2010 by Ketil Jansen and Ulrik Denizou Lund. The duo had known each other since they were kids and have both done music in different directions most of their lives. 19 years old and just finished school, they decided to make some music together, Ulrik with background in rock/indie bands and Ketil with background in electronic music. They are influenced by acts such as Daft Punk, RÃ¶yksopp, Justice, The Strokes, Ratatat, Phoenix, Noisia and Deadmau5.

Their second EP, Relativity 2, was #1 on iTunes' electronic albums chart in the US and Canada, #3 in Switzerland, #8 in Australia, and #10 in France for the month of May 2012. Relativity 2 was also #4 worldwide in iTunes' Pop category, right behind Adele.
