Seelenluft is Beat Soler from Zurich. He has been playing music since he was seven, and has made a number of records in the past ten years.

He signed with Klein Records and released his debut The Rise and Fall of Silvercity Bob in 2000. Silvercity Bob is an imaginary trumpet player and the album relies heavily on Beat Soler's collection of 1950s easy listening records.

The Synchronswimmer EP was released as a soundtrack for Acapulco 11, a synchronized swimming team. He recorded his latest album Out of the Woods over a couple of months in Los Angeles during 2002.

The single Manila featured Michael Smith, a 12-year-old boy from Compton, on lead vocals. Influential BBC Radio 1 disc jockey Pete Tong declared it an essential new tune and it has been remixed six times. It reached the ARIA top 50 Australian singles charts in March 2004. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seelenluft">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
