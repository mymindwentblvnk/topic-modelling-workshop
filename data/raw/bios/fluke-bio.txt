1. Fluke is an electronic band formed in 1988 at Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, UK, by Mike Bryant, Jon Fugler and Mike Tournier. The group are noted for their diverse range of electronic styles spanning the house, techno, ambient and blues genres.

Fluke started out making dreamy pop before the explosion of acid house influenced them. It was the growing electronica sound that influenced their early singles (Thumper, Joni, Slid) and their techno-rock debut album The Techno Rose of Blighty (1991). In the same year they released a live album entitled Out (In Essence).

Fluke signed with Virgin for their next albums Six Wheels On My Wagon (1993) and OTO (1995), which proved Fluke to be a driving force in the progressive house and trip-hop scenes. This era provided singles like Electric Guitar (Humbucker), Groovy Feeling (Make Mine a 99), Bubble (Speechbubble), Bullet and Tosh.

Their fourth studio album Risotto was a runaway success in 1997 and 1998, powered by the big-beat songs Atom Bomb and Absurd. After enjoying worldwide touring for several years, Fluke took time off to expand their already-massive remixography, releasing the retrospective Progressive History X in 2001, followed by Progressive History XXX in 2002. 

Their newest and most mature album, Puppy, followed in mid-2003, this time incorporating Jon Fugler and Mike Bryant only, while Mike Tournier concentrated on his own band Syntax together with vocalist Jan Burton.

Bryant and Fugler are currently working on the electronica project 2 Bit Pie along with Jan Burton and other musicians who released their first album 2 Pie Island in 2006.
