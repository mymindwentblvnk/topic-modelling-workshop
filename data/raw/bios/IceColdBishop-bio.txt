ICECOLDBISHOP is rapper born and raised in South Central, Los Angeles. With an eccentric delivery and wide array of flows, he kicked off his musical career with a string of unconventional anthems.

Despite having rapped for fun since the age of eight, it was not until adulthood that ICECOLDBISHOP put his verses on record: his gloomy debut single, "Porch," arrived online in October 2017, delivering haunting street narratives over a murky piano melody. Following a six-month battle with homelessness, the rapper continued his career into 2018 and 2019, releasing versatile singles "Katana" and "Creep" alongside landing on video platform COLORS with third single "IRATE." After moving into 2020 with the Bregma-produced "BITCH PLEASE" and "PUSH TO START," the upcoming rapper collaborated with rising Connecticut producer Kenny Beats for "DICKIES SUIT." ~ David Crone <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/IceColdBishop">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
