Bludded Head is a Drone Doom band from Denton, Texas consisting of Nevada Hill (vocals/guitar), Darcy Neal (electric cello), and Mike Forbes (drums).

The Legend of the Bludded Head:
(as told by Gillian Hill at age 5)
So a man got into a car wreck and had to go to the hospital, but in the process he lost his body, and was bleeding through his head, hence becoming the Bludded Head. 
Then the doctors gave him a bunch of drugs to try and save him, and the drugs turned him into a bleeding cloud. So now he is a cloud and he goes around and bleeds on people. His only friend is a flying cat.

Their self-titled debut album was released on May 29, 2012. The album was recorded by Matthew Barnhart at Echo Labs directly onto 2" tape, and was then mastered using all analog equipment in Dallas at A&R records. The artwork was created by Gillian Hill, Nevada Hill's daughter, and screen-printed by Nevada Hill.
