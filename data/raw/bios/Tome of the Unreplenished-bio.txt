Tome of the Unreplenished is an artistic musical project created only as a form of our own expression, with the purpose of enticing the listener in an aeviternal esoteric solitude of thoughts and emotions,combined with a sublime yet again dismal form of language and execution. This new work is completely independent and without limitations but only as a representation of our own philosophical evolution,progression and elevation.
