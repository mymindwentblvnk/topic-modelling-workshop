Zophrenia was a Swedish symphonic black metal band formed in 2004. They released 3 demos and a full length before fading into obscurity. There sound is a unique blend of the symphonic black metal sound of early days Cradle Of Filth and Dimmu Borgir and a new wave of techno or 8-bit metal such as Horse the Band and Powerglove. As there programmed drum sound and twisted high/low vocal mix was accentuated by synth/keyboard melodies, Zophrenia continues to be a band of it's own genre. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zophrenia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
