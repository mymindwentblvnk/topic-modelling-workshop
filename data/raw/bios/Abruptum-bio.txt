Abruptum is a Swedish black ambient band formed in 1990 by IT and All. Notable for long, gruesome sessions of improvised noise, they would allegedly record during acts of self-mutilation. The band became kind of famous very much thanks to the fact that IT was one of the leaders within what was called the Satanic Black Circle, along with members of bands like Mayhem and Emperor. IT had planned to create the band already in 1987 but it wasn't until 1990 that he found the right member to do it. The same year they recorded their first two demos. After the release of the first demo they kicked out their bass player Ext. After the release of a 7" EP called simply called "Evil" in 1991 (later re-released by Psychoslaughter) All began to drink heavily and was forced to leave the band. IT then found a new member in Morgan "Evil" HÃ¥kansson from the young band Marduk. IT left the band in 1997, and soon afterwards the black metal scene completely after growing disillusioned with it, Evil continued the band as a solo project until 2005 when the band's dissolution was announced, due to the growing popularity of his main project Marduk. Only  three years later in 2008, Evil reactivated the project, and continues to record and release for the project up to the present day.

IT passed away in 2017, with no cause of death announced publically.
