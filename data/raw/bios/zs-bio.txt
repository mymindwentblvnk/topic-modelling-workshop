Zs is a Brooklyn, New York (USA) based experimental / noise / post-punk band. The band was founded in 2000 by tenor saxophonist and composer Sam Hillmer. Since the band’s inception Zs has incarnated as everything from a sextet to a duo, most recently featuring Patrick Higgins (electric guitar) and Greg Fox (drum set), in addition to Hillmer’s signature sax ranting. While Zs' music has been variously categorized as noise, post-punk, minimalist, drone, and psych, they are primarily concerned with making music that challenges the physical and mental limitations of both performer and listener. The band has been heralded by New York Times as "one of the strongest avant-garde bands in New York."
