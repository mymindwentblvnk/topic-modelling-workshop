Dithyramvos is an one man project.

basic genre is atmospheric black metal, but also explores the dark sides of space/ambient/occult music
& compose the hymns & laments for the times to come...

i write music as a catharsis ,an ascending of spirit ,
& i know my vision in music
can be seen by few only.
i dont count my work as 'a band' and this way will remain forever.

~thanks all people that gave me their support!

im happy if someone of you find here anything that give you a glimpse,
an ascending, or make the darkness inside you bigger or easier...
after all...
