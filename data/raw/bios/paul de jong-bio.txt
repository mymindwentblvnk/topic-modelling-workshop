Paul de Jong is a former member of the powerful musical duo The Books. After they disbanded in 2012, Nick Zammuto, the other member of the duo, went on to form his own band under his surname. Paul, however, remained silent. It wasn't until 2015 that he announced that he was going to release his first solo LP, "IF" on Temporary Residence Ltd Records (the same record label that has supported Nick and Paul for a while).

Paul's musical stylings from the early sounds of The Books are very present in his solo music. The sound-collage qualities and obscure sampling are still here. His instrumentation is still very cozy and entrapping. It seems that The Books are over, but the creativity will never cease as long as Nick and Paul are still alive. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+de+Jong">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
