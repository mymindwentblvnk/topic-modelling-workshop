After the release of their first (and last) official album, Amer LeChatier (19??-1999) committed suicide and Malvery disappeared from the scene. Apparently the band still exists with Vorlord now doing the vocals but this is unconfirmed.

In november 1993, Malvery was lead by the founder member Alex Turbide. Since the formation of the band, before accessing the actual concept, Malvery had to progress from different music style: from agressive speed metal to dark death metal. They had to do alot of line up changes throught the last years.

In 1994, the arrival of the singer-lyric composer Mario Milette, completed the actual formation. In the past three years, Malvery acquired alot of experiences and maturity as much on the scene as on the musical concept; which gives them the necessary tools to be part of the international scene and from this fact, becoming professional artists.

Black metal band from Quebec, Canada.
