Fangtooth were born in 2007 when old friends Sfack with Grendel and Painkiller from death metal band Exhuman decided to play again together after 3 years from the split of their former doom band called Karnstein. After a year of work to make their own studio, Fangtooth wrote their self-titled album in 5 months and in the summer of 2009 they begun to record it. At the end of the same year joined the band bassist Joseph Reginson, another old friend and alcoholic bud of Sfack, Grendel and Painkiller. Now the album is out and the band is working to unleash a new devastating doom blast.
