Formed in 2004 in Athens, Greece, Dead Congregation focus on lacking aspects in today’s death metal bands/releases: feeling, spirit, atmosphere and quality. Since forming, they have released 2 full-length albums, 2 EPs and a split 7" with Hatespawn. They also run their own record label, Martyrdoom Productions and are associated with Norma Evangelium Diaboli. Their most recent album, Promulgation of the Fall, was released in 2014. Their EP 'Sombre Doom' was released in November 2016.

The band is highly praised for their live performances, having shared the stage with many well-established metal acts including Sodom, Interment, Deströyer 666, Incantation, Grave Miasma, Primordial, Gorgoroth, Watain and many others.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+Congregation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
