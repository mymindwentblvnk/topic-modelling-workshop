The Essex Green is the name of an Elephant Six indie rock band from Brooklyn, NY. Comprised of permanent members Jeff Baron, Sasha Bell (formerly of The Ladybug Transistor) and Chris Ziter, along with Michael Barrett and Tim Barnes, they formed in 1997 and were later signed to Kindercore Records, who released their first album, Everything Is Green, later that year.
