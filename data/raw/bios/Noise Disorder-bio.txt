Noise Disorder is one of the creative outlets for “Glitch” – a successful entrepreneur and radical software architect. After completing a lucrative business deal, Glitch began to devote more and more time to creative pursuits. Noise Disorder is the reclusive Glitch’s vehicle for exploring mental landscapes, conflicts, and structures. Each track is crafted from a single piece of audio “source” material, which is broken up into many small constituent parts. Each aural puzzle piece is then processed with various equalizations, envelopes, sampler looping, and other effects until it is transformed into a unique instrument that plays a specific role in the eventual sonic sculpture. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Noise+Disorder">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
