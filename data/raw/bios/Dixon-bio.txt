The band Dixon are known for their unusual style of music, or as they like to call it; "Arabian Grunge Surfmetal". Their first singer, Steve Birby O'donnel was fired from the band when Berry Mouse, Musk fifth street's former singer, showed his intrest in joining Dixon. He joined them in Ferbruary 1991 and they released the first official album, Chemical Oasis a year later (in 1992).
A new album will probably be released in March 2007. The album is being recorded in a small studio in "Höfn í Hornafirði", Iceland.
