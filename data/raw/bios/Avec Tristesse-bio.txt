Avec Tristesse (with sadness in french) is a Brazilian (Rio de Janeiro) heavy metal band formed in 2000, which mixes different styles inside and outside the genre, such as doom, death and gothic metal.
Described as dark/extreme progressive metal in Brazil,  Avec Tristesse  is a unique mixture of incredible, atmoshperic sensation.

Avec Tristesse began as a side-project of frontman Pedro Salles when he was still a bassist for folk-progsters Ashtar. He recorded Avec Tristesse's first songs - which would happen to be "The Crown of Uncreation" (3rd song in "Ravishing Beauty") and "The Failed Savior" (as yet unreleased) in the year of 1998. 

It was only two years later, however, that the project took form as a band with the arrivals of Nathan Thrall and Rafael Gama. They released their debut, "Ravishing Beauty", in 2002, through Hellion Records. Their second album, "How Innocence Dies", was released in 2004, also through Hellion Records. In 2009  the band split up but in 2013 they came back with a new album called ''Use & Control''.

The band is also known for popularizing the term "dark metal" in Brazil, which was used by the media and their record label to describe them.
In 2013 the band came back with a new album called ''
