The Partisan Turbine is a brutal death metal  band who combine Circle of Dead Children-esque deathgrind and Devourment-style slam death metal with the tropes of modern deathcore.

Since the bands start in 2003 there was a few member changes such as, new vocalist and drummer, as well as adding a well needed bassist to the brutality. From the start to present, the band has established a strong local fan base and has shared the stage with national acts such as, Deadwater Drowning, All Shall Perish, and Through the Eyes of the Dead. The immaculate drive in all of the members, to create music that both catch the ear of the public and fulfills their own general expectations of brutal and technical music is a strong force to be reckoned with.

The Partisan Turbine officially signed to Siege of Amida and Candlelight Records in late 2006 and will being rele asing a debut album under the labels in late April/ early May 2007. Tour dates are currently being booked for the album release and then some. “Prepare for a ruthless beating and some of the most explosive, murderous breakdowns you will ever hear.”
