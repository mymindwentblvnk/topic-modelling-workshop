Talented brutal death/doom act with violin and female grunts that operated in the mid nineties.. Without knowing the grunts are done by a female vocalist, you would not be able to tell (shamefully it is still rare for females to grunt). Occasional bursts of speed are not unknown (think pure death-metal) as with the use of spoken sampled intros.

They released two demo's before breaking up:
1996: 'Forty Days Longing'
1997: 'The Head of the Demon'

Members have moved on to various other bands: Betray My Trust, Garden of Shadows, While Heaven Wept, Modulus and Brave. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Forty+Days+Longing">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
