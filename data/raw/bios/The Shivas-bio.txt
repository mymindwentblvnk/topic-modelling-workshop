Formed in the summer of 2006 in Vancouver, Washington. The Shivas take cues from all the great psychedelic acts of the 60s. Technically proficient playing, various instrumentation and strong hooks make an immediate impression upon listeners, but it's the timeless sound and feel of The Shivas' music that makes them a band to watch very closely.

Band members include:

Jared Wait-Molyneux - Guitar, Vocals, Keyboard (Piano, Organ, etc.) Harmonica, Mad Mandolin, Slide Guitar
Eric Shanafelt - Congas, Vocals, Dumbek, Djembe, Kick Tambourine and other assorted percussion
Colby Wait-Molyneux - Drum Set, Backing Vocals
