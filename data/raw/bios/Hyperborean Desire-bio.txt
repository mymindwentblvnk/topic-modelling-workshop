Hyperborean Desire is a black metal band from Czech Republic ince 2003.

Hyperborean Desire is original musically-idealistic entity. It's basic thought which is connected to all tracks of this band is finding Hyperborea as a unreachable voluntaristic ideal, mythic land, where rules eternal spring. The band is a voice of desire to return of Tradition, searching of old values, overrun of sensual apprehension and materialism of modern age. Through music we glorify timeless values for which in ancient times lived individuals and nations.
