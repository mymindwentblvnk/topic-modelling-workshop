Beyond Twilight play experimental progressive rock and metal.

Their first album, The Devil's Hall of Fame, featured renowned hard rock/metal singer Jorn Lande.

The band's second album, Section X, is a logical continuation of The Devil's Hall of Fame.

With their latest release, For The Love of Art and the Making, they have continued to push the musical envelope in both heaviness and complexity. This opus, which is 43 tracks long and mixes elements of classical composition with crushing metal rhythms, is meant to be played either straight through, or on shuffle, yielding a different arrangement with each listen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beyond+Twilight">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
