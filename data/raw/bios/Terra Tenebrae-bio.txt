Terra Tenebrae was a Greek black / death metal band. They released one album in 1999 before breaking up. The only thing I know about the band is that Gothmog from Thou Art Lord and Kostas Dead from Obsecration were part of the line-up.   They have since changed their name to Soulskinner and released 'Breeding The Grotesque' in 2003. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Terra+Tenebrae">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
