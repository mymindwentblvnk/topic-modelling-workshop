A single-release pseudonym for the multi-talented Devin Townsend, Ocean Machine is somewhat of a deviation from Townsend's more angst-ridden output with band Strapping Young Lad. Biomech is an album filled with lush, textured soundscapes that evoke thoughts of the aquatic and inspire introspection.

The Biomech album was originally released under the artist name "Ocean Machine", although shortly after its release, Hevy Devy Records requested that the album be changed to "Ocean Machine: Biomech", and that it would be under the artist "Devin Townsend". 
However, the distributors of the album in Australia refused to make the requested changes to the album, and it is still released under the name "Ocean Machine" in Australia today. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ocean+Machine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
