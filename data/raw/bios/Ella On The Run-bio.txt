London based alt-pop artist Ella On The Run's laid-back vocals and synth pop vibes have already garnered attention from the likes of BBC Radio 1, Huffington Post and Clash Music; and she has performed with Tove Styrke - a sold-out London show in association with the Line of Best Fit. After studying at the prestigious Berklee College of Music in the US, Ella began recording in LA with producer/co- writer Matthew Bang (Interscope, Timbaland's Mosley Music group). With her infectious alt-pop music, and already standing amongst a new generation of alt-pop queens such as Rosie Lowe and Banks, Ella On The Run has been deservedly elected a “songstress on the rise”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ella+On+The+Run">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
