Founded in 2004 Concept Insomnia stands out for a type Progressive Metal which hasn’t been played by german Metalbands ever before! Expressive vocals and shattering growls combined with atmospheric keyboards meet mutable guitars and a precise rhythm section. There’s no doubt about it…Concept Insomnia perfectly manage to build a bridge between filigree melodies and a pounding brutality. 
With their first Demo CD, produced by Rolf Munkes (Ex-Majesty, Empire) in spring 2006, the quintet broke new ground and created their own path in the huge scene of Heavy Metal. So as a remarkable consequence “No Words” was “Demo of the month” in the german RockHard-Magazine in September 2006. 

Besides the positive reactions to their first release Concept Insomnia also expanded their fanbase by playing numerous energetic live-gigs in 2006/2007…and to keep it growing the band will come up with a new release ("Second Glance" 4-track-ep) in June 2007 as well as further livedates! In Flames meets Dream Theater, Opeth meets Children Of Bodom…watch out for the new Prog-Metal-Jackhammer from Germany: Concept Insomnia!!!
