Trivax is an Extreme Metal band which was originally formed in Iran under inside the walls of an underground territory to stay away from those who banned this genre of music.
currently active in the UK, the band seeks nothing but retribution, liberation and chaos!

History: Trivax is a circle of mayhem and misanthropy that crawled out of nowhere and will destroy everything that stands in front of it as the existence of a band like this serve very high purposes.
It was originally formed as a one man black metal band by Shayan in Tehran, Iran in year 2009 and later in 2010 it achieved a full line-up and the band ended up with a lot of problems caused by authorities due to Metal being banned and the members at that time which included robbery, drug problems and getting stabbed.
in 2011 Shayan disbanded Trivax and moved to Birmingham UK the home of metal on his own to find a way to continue Trivax and pursue the mission and after 3 months of stay while studying music he found and formed the true Trivax that it is today.
Since then the band has been very active and they have improved every day with their craftsmanship.
“Trivax is a very active and hard working band although inside the band is always surrounded by very dark energies that are chosen to be manifested through us and the music itself has always come out of very dark places and very dark situation while we had been searching for a burning redemption to give back these melodies that have been given to us.”
The combination of the hard work and the surrounding energies and actions and the actual songwriting abilities of Shayan and their limitless will-power certainly make Trivax a very unique band among many others.
It is something that you have to experience to understand.
