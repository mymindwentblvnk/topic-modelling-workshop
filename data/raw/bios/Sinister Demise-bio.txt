Sinister Demise play brutal, uncompromising death metal.
Since their critically acclaimed first demo, "Nullify" in 2003, the band has shared stages with many of the greats of the Death metal Genre including Nile, Suffocation, Dismember, Dying Fetus, Anata, Necrophagist and Grave.

Taking influence from the more tight and aggressive aspects of Early 90's American death metal and blending it with subtle technical nuances, the band have formed a sound which is quite unique in the Irish metal scene.

Their 2006 release "Eluded by Enlightenment" showcases this approach with a more polished and structured sound, while still retaining the ferocity and brutality of the debut.

The band is currently working on a debut album, scheduled for release in late 2007/early 2008 while gigging extensively throughout Ireland.

"This band playing live is an exercise in brutality, technicality and most importantly musicality, meaning each of these qualities should be savoured"
