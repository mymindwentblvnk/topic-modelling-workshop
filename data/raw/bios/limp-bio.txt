At least two groups are named Limp.

Limp were a punk rock/pop punk  band from the San Francisco Bay Area that released three albums on Honest Don's, a subsidiary label of Fat Wreck Chords, as well as an EP on Fueled By Ramen, and a 7" record of early material on Coldfront Records.

Limp's career was launched with the release of their first full length Pop and Disorderly in 1997. Hailing from the East Bay, Limp was born out of the same punk scene that brought about Rancid, Neurosis, Econochrist, and Fang. The record was well received not only because of its highly infectious content but also because the band remained on the road for over a year in support of the album.

Despite the hectic touring schedule, in 1998 Limp recorded a five-song EP for Less Than Jake's label, Fueled by Ramen, titled Fine Girl. Recorded by Ryan Greene and mixed by Kevin Army (Green Day and Operation Ivy). Fine Girl exceeded everyone's expectations. In fact, Fueled by Ramen has pressed the record over three times.

Limp released their sophomore LP for Honest Don's in February 1999. The album was titled Guitarded, and was recorded over the course of seven months in 1998 between a slew of tours. Guitarded was a huge hit on college radio and got more airplay than any previous Honest Don's record. Following up in 2002, Limp released their self-titled third studio full length, which was recorded at Motor Studios with Ryan Greene, who produced Pop and Disorderly and Guitarded. Greene is known for his work with punk bands (NOFX, Nerf Herder, Swingin' Utters, Lagwagon, etc.) as well as Cheap Trick. The self-titled album displays Limp's ability to blend catchy pop-punk with dynamic rock. Producer Ryan Greene had this to say about the record, "It's crazy. There's some insane vocal stuff going on here." Shortly after this release, Limp disbanded.

Limp has done full tours with MxPx, The Donnas, Less Than Jake, Lagwagon, Suicide Machines, Dance Hall Crashers, and the Bouncing Souls. In addition to Limp's rigorous touring schedule, they also played high-profile dates with Foo Fighters, Blink-182, The Offspring, Goldfinger, NOFX, The Specials, and Unwritten Law as well as performing on the Warped Tour and at CMJ.
