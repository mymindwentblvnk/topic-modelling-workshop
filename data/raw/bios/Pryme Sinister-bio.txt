Pryme Sinister has released its demo album called "Stryke!" after a painstaking effort. 

The album consists of three songs and can be downloaded in downloads section either as separate songs, or a three-song RAR archive from http://www.prymesinister.com 

Although a series of concerts with new band members is in the pipeline, Pryme Sinister are recording new songs at full speed and searching for a record company to make the band's albums official. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pryme+Sinister">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
