Hailing from a city steeped in house culture, Chicago’s John Summit has quickly become the hottest name in dance music worldwide. His feel-good floor-fillers take the pumping grooves of his hometown’s classic house music, add a healthy dose of melody, and top it all off with 2020s studio polish.

Summit’s prolific output has resulted in the accumulation of 5 million monthly Spotify listeners, the top-selling artist across all genres on Beatport in 2021, and a #1 track on US Dance radio with his record ‘Human’. In 2022 he’s set to tour across the globe with key festival plays at Coachella, Lollapalooza, Tomorrowland, Bonnaroo, Parklife, and more. With the announcement of his new label/event brand ‘Off The Grid’, Summit is displaying no signs of slowing down anytime soon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/John+Summit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
