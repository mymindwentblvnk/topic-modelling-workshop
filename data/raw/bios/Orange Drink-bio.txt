Orange Drink is a one-man band created by Drew Fernando, who is a gay, vegetarian, straight edge, Sri Lankan-American in an intergenerational same-sex marriage, living in Wisconsin. In 2016, Drew successfully met the challenge of completing one song a week. Since June, he has been releasing these on his website as part of his Music Mondays campaign to great acclaim from fans and critics alike. He has averaged one blog track writeup a month, from places like France, Germany, the United Kingdom, as well as the USA.

Orange Drink performs a shockingly wide variety from music. From genres spanning hardcore punk, hip-hop, dance, noise, folk, ambient, and everything in between, thereâ€™s always something new and exciting every week! He has recently returned to performing in Milwaukee and Chicago and is planning a tour for Summer 2017.
