Glimmer Of Blooms is a multi-instrumentalist based in Austria, Vienna. Intending to create his sounds all by himself, this 25 year old multi-instrumentalist produces his songs without making use of samples and rather focuses on uncommon ways of recording. His sound is best described as vocalised chill out tunes which tend to recall memories and feelings. In his songs guitar-play and piano-chords don't just have the job of simply underpinning Glimmer of Blooms' voice but rather function as equally prominent in each track.
