Shadowseeds is a dark wave/esoterical musical project consisting of Thomas Karlsson and Tommie Eriksson.
Thomas Karlsson is founder and head of magical order of Dragon Rouge, a Left-Hand Path initiatory organization.
Tommie Eriksson (also known as Tommy Eriksson), is a musician who played in the symphonic metal band Therion. Eriksson was guitarist in 1995, drummer from 1996–1997, and guitarist from 1997–1998 (on Vovin and Crowning of Atlantis).  He is currently best known as the songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist of occult stoner doom metal band Saturnalia Temple.

Shadowseeds released their first and one and only album The Dream of Lilith in 1995 on Dark Age/Megarock Records.
The album was hardly at all promoted by the label and it sank with inertia into an esoteric underground cult status.
