Francistown, Botswana
Metal Orizon (Orison: Old English word for prayer) are three self-taught
musicians, indigenous to Africa. They reside in Gaberone, capital city of the
Republic of Botswana. The Group was formed 1991 due to a common love
of heavy metal and hard rock. They are influenced by most European and American
heavy rock/metal bands. They started out as a four piece band, but lost their
original drummer in 1993 (who was replaced by Stroke) Their rhythm guitarist also
decided to quit that same year. Spencer left the band temporarily to live in the USA for
2 years while studying (1995-1997) Metal Orizon perform and record only their own
compositions and their music can be classified as hard rock /heavy metal.
The band's first major appearance was in South Africa in a town called Meyerton
(December 1997) where they played with other prominent South African heavy
metal/hardcore bands. They've appeared at various other SA venues since and have
tremendous response from the South African music faternity.Metal Orizon has
released their self-entitled full-lenght debut CD recorded at B-Sharp Studios,
Benoni, South Africa.
