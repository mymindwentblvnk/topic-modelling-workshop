The Long Lost consists of husband-&-wife Alfred (a.k.a. Daedelus) and Laura Darlington. In contrast to the avant-electronics and hip-hop aesthetics of Alfred's music as Daedelus, The Long Lost is a union of two songwriters & producers with a penchant for sad sounds and delicate, electro-acoustic melodies. Psychedelic lullabies for lovers and the lovelorn. As well as Sa-Ra, Laura has also sung for Flying Lotus. A fascinating and utterly individual project, The Long Lost take the subject of love away from the cliches and hackneyed wailing of the mainstream and reconnect it to those strange and uncontrollable emotions weâ€™re all so in thrall to. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Long+Lost">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
