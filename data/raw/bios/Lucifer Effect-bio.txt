Lucifer Effect is a depressive black metal project of Eija Risen. Cleansing the Cult of Disgust has been composed within the span of 2009-2015 because of inability to record and produce it. Recorded in 2015 with B.M. from Skyforest. Still unfinished, but abandoned and released in instrumental form. Vocals may be added later, if there is a demand for a full version. 

There is also Where Words End.
