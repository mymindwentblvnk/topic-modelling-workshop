BIO
Embodied Torment took shape over the course of 2011, as Matt Chaco (vox) and Cindy Chaco (drums) joined forces with Casey Ryle (guitars), Joaquin Chavez (guitars), and David Ko (bass). After an initial phase of playing a fairly traditional form of death metal, represented by their early demo, the quintet gradually focused on the most brutal and extreme elements of their sound. Ryle departed in mid-2012, which saw the band continue on as a four-piece and record their 'Kyphonism' promo, which represented their new sonic direction. 

In 2013 and 2014, the band refined their live attack and continued to push the boundaries of their sound into greater complexity and extremes of tempo and brutality. Embarking on their first tour in November of 2013, their performances gained them the attention of rising death metal label New Standard Elite, with whom they signed on in June 2014. Embodied Torment is currently at work writing their first full-length for a 2015 release.

The band has performed with such luminaries of the extreme death metal world as Exhumer, Amputated Genitals, Pessimist, Abhorration, SICK, Shawn Whitaker, Dying Fetus, Cattle Decapitation, Cerebral Bore, Krisiun, Omnihility, Carnal Decay, Arsis, Devour The Unborn, Corpsefucking Art, and Coprophiliac. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Embodied+Torment">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
