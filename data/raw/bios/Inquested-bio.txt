Based in Kongsberg, Norway, Inquested will deliver hard-hitting, technical and groovy metal to all you metal-heads out there. Our foundation rests firmly on thrash-metal with a good dose of melody. We also include elements of other styles in the metalgenre. We take all these influences and come up with our kind of music.

Guitar/Vox: Vebj√∏rn Flaata Gulli
Drums: Stian Junge Strand

Bass: Magnus J. Grimnes <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inquested">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
