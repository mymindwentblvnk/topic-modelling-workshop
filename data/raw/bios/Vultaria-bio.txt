Vultaria began in August of 2009 when friends Josh Chilcote and Brandon Mitchell decided to create music again after a long break from one another. Weary of the way things were going with their previous endeavors, they set out to resurrect a lethal combination of thrash/death metal that has been missing from Ohio's stagnant scene. Almost a month after writing together, they pulled in Steve on drums and the 3 quickly became tight as a band. In January, they went to the studio and recorded their first EP "Spiritual Putrefaction". Shortly after releasing the CD they picked up longtime friend Zack Smith on bass. In February, they parted ways with Steve and in late March picked up current drummer Blaine Allen. As of current they are working on building a fan-base and bringing the music that they are passionate about back to Central Ohio. One day they hope to spread it to the rest of the world.
