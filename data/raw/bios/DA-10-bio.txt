Made up of MPC master 10-David and synth genius Danalogue, DA-10 take their name from a mythological piece of hardware with the power to fuse bouncing beats with powerful electronics.

Constructed entirely on an AKAI MPC 1000 and Roland Juno 6 and SH-09 synths, this 100% hardware made EP will pull you through your speakers into a whole new aural dimension. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DA-10">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
