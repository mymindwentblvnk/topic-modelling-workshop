Ork was formed in 1995 by Count Vassilium. During the same year, the first demo "Through the Fight I Ride" was released. Later in 1997 the second demo "Slava Nam"
comes to a light. After this demo the guitar player Frosthammer comes in the band. Both with Count Vassilium they record the third demo "At a Novo Magico" at the cold winter of 1998. After that, during the same year, the band
was joined by the drummer Gravedigger, the second guitar player Hellthorn and bassist Grimlord. With this line up the band recorded the promo "Gronderblud" which was released by the Norwegian label "Oskorei" and is a great success. In 2000 the band recorded their first length album, "Blessed by Evil", released by the German label "Folter rec." Later, on its promotion, the band played at the German festival "Under the Black Sun" and in the Czech Republic. In Germany the band recorded their second album entitled "Karma Diabolica" unreleased yet - as decided by the band! Ork is also notorious for playing many gigs in Bulgaria and as one of the first and true Bulgarian old school black metal bands. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ork">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
