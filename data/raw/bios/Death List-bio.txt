Death List was originally called OBLITERATION.  Hailing from Oklahoma City, OK, OBLITERATION/Death List was a christian death metal band that dominated the underground christian metal scene in OKC and the southwest region of the U.S. in the late 90's.  Founded in 1997, OBLITERATION released a 4-song demo entitled, "Dying Age."  Dying Age was also included, in its entirety, on a compilation called "Chords of the Grave," which was released and distributed by Cross Rhythms Music (now Blastbeats Music).  The "Chords of the Grave" comp is widely viewed as arguably the greatest christian death metal comp of all time!  In 1998, after the original vocalist left the band, the band retooled and changed the name to Death List.  As Death List, they would release their first and only full-length album entitled, "Severed."  OBLITERATION/Death List has shared the stage with the following:

Napalm Death
Living Sacrifice
Melchezidek
Eternal Decision
Frank's Enemy
Skinlab
Exodus
Obituary
Suffocation
Six Feet Under
Extol

In addition to the above bands, OBLITERATION/Death List also played two Texas Rockfests. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+List">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
