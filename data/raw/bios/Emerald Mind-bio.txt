Emerald Mind was formed in Vladivostok, Russia, in 2003 by a couple of friends guitarist Alexey Vaulin and bassist Andrey Berezov. First show took place in the small underground club named “In Rock”. It was not only the birth of the band but a stage debut of their beautiful and talented singer Svetlana Vysotskaya. After a few gigs, in early 2004, Andrey left the band and start his own carrier.

The next five years Emerald Mind continued working on new songs and trying to record a quality demo. In those days it was not an easy task, because Vladivostok was too far away from any metal music industry. Finally, in november 2009, band released their first album “Tales Of Soveena” and moved to St. Petersburg to discover new horizons.

The northern capital met the musicians with the cold wind and lots of challenges. So even the very existence of the band was under question. In 2011 Alexey and Svetlana decided to move on and start writing new material for the second album. So at this moment this work almost done and we can’t wait to share with you our hopes, dreams, experience and feelings that we put in our music! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Emerald+Mind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
