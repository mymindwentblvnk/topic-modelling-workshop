Verbum is neo-classical and post-industrial project from Spain, based on apocalyptic ambient and ethnic passages, with spoken words in Spanish and Latin. Different instruments from the different parts of the world, piano, violin, orchestral pads, electronics sounds and strange percussions takes out to other dimension. The album consists nine Aevums that speaks about life, about you and me, about us. Each Aevum is a metaphor of one phase of knowlegde that we learn since birth until death. All the feelings of the human being presented in a specific way - like theatrical show. Darkness, sadness and poetry in 64 minutes of words and music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Verbum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
