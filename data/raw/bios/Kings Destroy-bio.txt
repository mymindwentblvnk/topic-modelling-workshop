Kings Destroy, is a hybrid of stoner rock, doom metal, and hardcore, hailing from New York City, New York, USA, and uniting musicians from many of the genres’ most prolific bands.

From the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, KD features guitarists Carl Porcaro and Chris Skowronski from legendary, 100k-album-selling Killing Time, vocalist Steve Murphy from Uppercut, drummer Rob Sefcik (formerly of Mans Ruin, The Begotten, Uppercut, and Electric Frankenstein), and bassist Ed Bocchino of Stanley and Uppercut.  

With influences like the Melvins, Yob, and Cro-Mags, KD describes their sound as “brutal [[artist]Black Sabbath] heaviness with hardcore outbursts and disturbed vocals verging on the demented.”  

King’s Destroy released their debut 7-inch on May 25th, featuring the singles “Old Yeller” and “Medusa” with digital versions available May 31st.  Their full-length LP, And The Rest Will Surely Perish, produced by the legendary Sanford Parker (Pelican, Nachtmystium) was scheduled for a Fall 2010 release, but didn't actually come out until 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kings+Destroy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
