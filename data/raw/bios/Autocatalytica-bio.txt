Biography

Started in early 2009 by Lead Guitarist/Singer Eric Thorfinnson,out of the ashes of his Toronto-Based Progressive Metal Band Ex Kathedra, This project represents a vast evolution in metal perspective based on non-traditional influences. In the fall of 2010, drummer Emmett Ceglia, guitarist Erik Sorensen, and bassist John Anderson joined Thorfinnson and began to play their first shows to an endearingly warm reaction. Shortly Thereafter Autocatalytica began recording their debut EP, "Horror Vacui". The EP features both Erik Sorensen and Thorfinnson taking vocal and guitar duties, Emmett Ceglia on drums, friends Drew Moore and Miles Esner on bass, and crazy synths by Topher Saunders. The Music itself is a diverse collage of many influences, From the over the top hyper-hatred-freakout, "Puketicus" to the more introspective, yet powerful "Splain", it is but a taste of what is to come from Autocatalytica. In Late 2011 After the Departure of Erik Sorensen In the Fall of 2011, Elijah Melanson replaced him on guitar duties, and Shaun Beacham joined as a full time bassist. More line up changes in 2012 saw Erik Sorensen return to guitar duties and Jon Ellis (Oculesics) join on Bass.

Autocatalytica has just recently entered the studio to record their debut full length due out in late 2013.
