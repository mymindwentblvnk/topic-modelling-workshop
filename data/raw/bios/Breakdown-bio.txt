The NYHC Breakdown started in Yonkers, NY just outside of NYC. It consisted of Jeff (Vocals), Carl (Guitar), Don (Guitar), Rich (Bass), and Drago (Drums.) The band fused the thrash style of A7 style hardcore punk with a modern metallic crunch, influenced by crossover sound of bands like Crumbsuckers, Cro-Mags, and Agnostic Front. Their classic demo, released as a 7" and then CD on Blackout! Records set the stage for bands like Hatebreed and Madball. This first line up of Breakdown split up in 1988, Jeff continued with new musicians, releasing albums on Thorp and Eyeball Records while Carl, Drago, and Rich joined with Ex-NY Hoods Guitarist and Ex-Token Entry vocalist Anthony to form Raw Deal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Breakdown">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
