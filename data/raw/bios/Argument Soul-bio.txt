The guitarist, Teraoka (ex. SONIC AGITATION) kicked off with the band in July 1998.
ARGUMENT SOUL played on their first show in September after difficult time. The 1st demo was released then. They got good response to the metal fanzine and the support of fans in Japan.
They participated in "THE RED HOT BURNING HELL VOL.2" (Lights Out RECORDS), then they did very well in JAPAN.

ARGUMENT SOUL changed members over and over again. And finally the band released their 1st full length album "REVIVING THE TRUTH" in October 2004.Also had many shows on tour in 2004 to 2005.In Sydney we shared the stage with No.1 Aussie metal band DUNGEON.
Now we are making new album to release in early next year.
ARGUMENT SOUL will be coming up to the expectation who is one of the little orthodox band in Japan.
