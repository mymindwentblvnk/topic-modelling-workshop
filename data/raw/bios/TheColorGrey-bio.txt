Grey's English raps combine a tight flow with smooth, laidback vibes, soulful beats and thoughtful lyrics. His self-produced music is a very personal blend of hip hop, new soul, blue jazz, cool r&b and urban pop, with striking melodies that often harbor slightly dark or melancholic undertones.  

Live on stage TheColorGrey performs accompanied by his homies Niel Soetaert on electric guitar and DJ Danga. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TheColorGrey">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
