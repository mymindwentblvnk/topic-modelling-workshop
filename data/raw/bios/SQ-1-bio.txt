After Sequential One fell apart in 1998, Andr√© "ATB" Tanneberger continued the project under the SQ-1 name with long-time co-producer Ulrich "Spacekid" Poeppelbaum.
As a Trance project, they have two great hits: "Dance" and "Balare".
Also in Brazil, "Can You Feel" had many executions in local radios.
