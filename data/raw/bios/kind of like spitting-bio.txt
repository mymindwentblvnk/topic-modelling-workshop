Inactive 2006- early 2011. Performed in the interim with/as Blunt Mechanic. Now active again.

Kind of Like Spitting has taken a staunchly independent approach to making records and performing, releasing eight records (at latest count) on small DIY indie labels (including but not limited to Hush Records, Barsuk, and Redder Records) , and doing tours across the country in a variety of venues, from the neighborhood house party to the big rock arena. At the core of KOLS is Ben Barnett, singer/songwriter with a talent for writing gut-wrenching tales of life and love.

Ben was previously in an indie rock band called Slotcar and he also played in the original line-up of The Thermals for a while.
David J. has a solo project called Novi Split.

A new record is planned for release in January 2010 under the name Blunt Mechanic. Seattle's Barsuk will release the disc, which will be titled World Record. Barnett debuted the new band at Mississippi Studios in Portland, OR. in August 2009.
