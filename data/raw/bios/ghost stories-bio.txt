2) Ghost Stories is the musical alias for Ron Lewis, a well-traveled musician based out of Seattle who has played with the likes of Colin Meloy, the Joggers, and the Dismemberment Plan. Lewis' sound is driven by soft and melodic folk, with a few examples of contemporary experimentation (whether it be key-based synth or distortion) making up memorable and often haunting songs. This would make Ghost Stories such an ideal name for the project, with songs that stay etched in your mind after several listens, despite the diverse and lengthy structures. Lewis tells his tales over a voice that does not stray over a whisper, mixing together lo-fi qualities with jumpy energetic acoustic guitar chords and synths. Lewis' new album, Quixoticism, will be released on January 23rd on Sonic Boom Recordings. The album has songs that date back seven years, most recorded at Lewisâ€™ home, hence his reputable title of a "bedroom musician". The band's live sets consists of a revolving door of musicians, though they still put on a great show.  from http://www.obscuresound.com/?p=484
