Dimesland is an abstract metal band based in Oakland, CA.
Three of the four members of Dimesland are also in a great band called Wild Hunt [who also recently got a Tepedelen stemp of approvel]. So what we have here is cool little organization with five people comprising two groups. Also within Dimesland are associations with The Residents and The Samps.

Operating out of Oakland, California, abstract metal quartet Dimesland produces a sound that is the result of a blend of controlled chaos and musical mutation, heavy tension and dark psychedelia. Dimesland is a place where aggression and imagination merge harmonically, rhythmically and lyrically to explore the terrain of psychological havoc and mental fracture. The band's live performances are frantic and dense and feature songs woven together with shorter pieces and textures for an almost nonstop presentation of sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dimesland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
