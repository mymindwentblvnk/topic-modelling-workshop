Ablepsia rose from nothingness in March 2003 to become the second black metal band from Varna after inexistant Zaratustra. Only three months were necessary for the line-up to come into present appearance, retaining more than two years and a half. The initial style was symphonic black metal as much more melodic elements intruded later. In October the same year was recorded the first demo, untitled and published for free download on the Internet. It caused curiosity in lots of listeners. The hard work continued as the band more often turned to live performances. In 2005 Ablepsia set up its own studio - it helped very much for the development. The songs became more aggressive, faster and musically consistent.

In 2006 the band continued live performing and thus, recieved an invitation to perform in Monsters Of Rock festival, which eventually didn't take place [because of misunderstanding between the organizators and Varna municipality]. In August, Ablepsia made their way to Basement Studio in Pleven, where they recorded 3 songs that were released in limited circulations. By the end of the year, the band took part in the Decadence festival II, which was their last concert in this line-up. The drummer Vo Ael decided to leave the band and the two guitarists Mephistopheles and Aesterial were expelled from the band due to internal quarrels. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ablepsia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
