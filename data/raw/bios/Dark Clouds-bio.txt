More than one artist is using the name "Dark Clouds".

1. Dark Clouds is a semi acoustic band, formed in 2007 by (ex) band members from The Fucking Virgins, Hailander, Water Goblins, Love for the Machine, Incontinentals, De Hema’s, Riot, Siff in the Crypt, the Ex and the Nixons.
In the semi acoustic setting, hardness, subtle instruments and the way of singing meet entirely. On the consonance of this music “Dark Clouds” can express their emotions better and you can hear and see this in the atmosphere which is put down on stage. With only self written songs and unexpected choice of instruments “Dark Clouds” is a band which captures the crowd and take them away along in their world.
