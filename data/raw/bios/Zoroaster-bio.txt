Zoroaster is a sludge metal band formed in the summer of 2003 by Brent Anderson (bass guitar, vocal), Will Fiore (guitar, vocal), and Rod Fiore (drums), three former colleagues in the defunct group Terminal Doom Explosion who rediscovered their mutual interests in primal, concrete sludge-doom.

Zoroaster, based in Atlanta, Georgia, United States has been rampaging the East Coast for the past years and has shared the stage with acts such as Gojira, Withered, Tualatin, Dove, Cream Abdul Babar, I/O, and many more.

Their influences include Black Sabbath, Celtic Frost, Sleep, Venom, and Godflesh. Their sludgy style of music has been described as menacing and unrelenting. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zoroaster">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
