Supreme Cuts are a Chicago based electronic duo. They describe their music as "future r&b", while the consensus in the blogosphere is "post-dubstep" because of its reliance on heavy bass, prominent percussion and pitch-shifted vocal samples.

Their debut release, Trouble, is now available via Small Plates Records:
