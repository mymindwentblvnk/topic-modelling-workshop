IN THE YEAR OF 1980, AMBULANCE SIRENS SCREAM THROUGH THE SMALL TOWN OF THIBODAUX, LOUISIANA. CARS PULL TO THE SIDE LIKE SPANISH SOLDIERS BOWING FOR THE QUEEN. "MAKE WAY", THE SIRENS BLARE. 11:55 PM AT THIBODAUX MEDICAL CENTER A PRINCE WAS STILLBORN JUST MINUTES BEFORE THE WITCHING HOUR. THE HOSPITAL ROOM FILLED WITH LIFE, YET ONLY THE DOCTOR AND PATIENT ARE ALIVE. THE LIFELESS BABY LAY IN HIS MOTHERS ARMS WHILE TEARS FELL LIKE RAIN AS BOTH ANGEL AND DEMON PLACE HANDS ON DEATHS FOREHEAD. A QUIETNESS SMOTHERS THE ROOM AS THE DOCTOR EXITS. SUDDENLY SHE COULD HEAR A FAINT SOUND COMING FROM THE BACK OF THE ROOM,,"TIC",,"TIC",,"TIC". JUST SECONDS BEFORE MIDNIGHT, ANGEL AND DEMON STARE INTO EACH OTHERS EYES AND BREATHE WORDS OF USE,"HE WILL BE WICKED","HE WILL BE RIGHTEOUS". SUDDENLY THE SILENCE IS BROKEN BY THE SCREAMS OF A NEWBORN,"TOC" THE CLOCK STRIKES TWELVE. A PROPHET IS BORN. A BEARER OF LIGHT AND DARK. ROYALTY TO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN AND HELL! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Prophets">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
