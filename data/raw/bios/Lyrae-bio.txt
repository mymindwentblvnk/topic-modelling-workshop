Lyrae is a solo project by Ola Sandberg, Sweden, that started the spring of 2013.

”I’m trying to make music that I, myself, can get lost in. Experimenting with loops and repetitive chord progressions that sit in a stream of sounds, both played and gathered, is a way of letting the focus be chosen by the listener. I want to make audible rooms rather than songs and let the listener be more of a visitor with the choice to move around freely.”
