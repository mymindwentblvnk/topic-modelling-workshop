German Thrash Metal Band DEPREDATION was formed 1999 by some drunk, unskilled Metal Maniax - it was not until 2000 when the first steady line-up was set.

Hailing from the former coal- and steel industrial region Ruhrarea in western Germany– right out of the neighbourhood of Metal Legends like Sodom or Kreator – the choice of the favoured musical style was easily made: Old School Thrash Metal, worshipping their origin simply called „Ruhrpottmetal“.

Entering the regional stages since 2001 – documented by the early Live-Promo „Live In Ratingen 2002“, the first material sign of life was released in 2003: the debut Demo CD „Megaton Scythe“, recorded by the band in their rehearsal room, gained some recognition in the underground scene.

Further gigs followed, amongst others at Mega Blast Festival in Wuppertal, Nebelmondparty Festival or in Sonderborg/Danmark.

Two years after „Megaton Scythe“ DEPREDATION entered a studio the first time to record the next CD „Ruhrpottmetal“, which was finally released in late 2005.
