Biography:

Kneel Before None is a malevolent death metal act whose malefic, villainous infused music will have your mind and body in a whole other realm of evil. Their debut album "Carnal Disfigurement" (fall 2014) has the content that could be compared to the diary of ed Gein with blast chops and diminished harmonies that the devil himself could only wish to fathom.

Kneel Before None came together as musical outfit with intent to do harm to any kind oppression that stands in their way in early 2012. The middle Tennessee death metal act has been steadily growing the fan base with the release of the "self titled demo" (Spring 2013) and playing countless gigs. They will keep expanding the hate, violence, and gore with the release of "Carnal Disfigurement". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/kneel+before+none">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
