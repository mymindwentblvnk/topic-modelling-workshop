The metal project 'CAUTIVA' was founded in 2006 by José Travieso after the split-up of a young band of just a few of sessions called Desvirgator. With an early self-educated pianistic formation and releasing several works for piano solo during the 1999-2003 period - exploring different styles like minimalism, romanticism, avant-garde or jazz-fusion, José Travieso re-invented himself as a metal guitarist after a time of creative silence. 

Leaving behind the split-up of his first attempt 'Desvirgator', he decided to develop his technical skills with the guitar and to record a demo of two songs with the idea of founding his own band later. The 'Cautiva project' was born and a few months later that demo was finished. 
Today, CAUTIVA is conceived as a "band of only one man" and nowadays José Travieso composes, writes, records and produces from time to time in his own study. «Fire, Walk With Me!» (released on January 25th 2008) is his first serious metal release, showing a sound full of strength, wrath and thrash, with complex riffs, passages and drum patterns inside a technical and progressive environment.

Actually José Travieso is writing and recording new stuff for a next album. Some of the new songs are: «Eat Your Tongue!», «Two Worlds», «War» and «Swing Of Love».

CAUTIVA is a Spanish word that means 'captive' and 'captivate' at the same time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cautiva">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
