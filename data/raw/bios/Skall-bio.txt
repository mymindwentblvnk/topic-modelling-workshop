Skall was a ska-punk band from norther germany, founded for having some fun in 2002! In the meantime they were going through a few changes: name-, style- and personal-wise.
Nowadays they're trying to play a mixture of Ska, Reggae and straight forwarded Punk-Rock.
Since the end of 2007 they played in a stable line-up and disbanded 2009, when the members started new projects all around the globe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skall">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
