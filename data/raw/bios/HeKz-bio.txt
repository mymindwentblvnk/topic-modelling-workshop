Whilst originally formed in 2003 when the members at the time were at school together, HeKz's current line up came to be in September 2008 when founder member Matt Young (Lead Vocals/Bass Guitar) and brother Danny Young (Guitar) recruited Kirk Brandham (Drums) and Alastair Beveridge (Guitar) to fill the vacant posts left by Nik Bryant and Adam Billington respectively. 

The "Orfeo" EP was recorded in late 2008 before the new line up had played a single show together, and was ultimately released in physical and digital formats in March 2009 to widespread critical acclaim both in print and online. Tragedy pre-empted the release of the EP in January 2009 when Kirk Brandham was taken ill, he wouldn't return to active duty until September of the same year.

2010 saw HeKz start to branch out onto national metal scene with a number of self-financed UK tours and several summer festival engagements, including an appearance at Bloodstock Open Air's 10th Anniversary. A further tour of the UK followed in September 2010 and the band are currently working towards recording their debut album, which is set for release in late 2011 on Metal Dwarf Music.
