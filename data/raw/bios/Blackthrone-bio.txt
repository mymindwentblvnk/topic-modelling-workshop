Blackthrone is a Finnish hardcore punk parody band from Oulu, that was originally started as an inside joke ridiculing black metal clich√©s. This comedic approach towards the black metal genre has caused much outrage throughout the years from orthodox black metal fans. Their only full-length album entitled "Black Metal Juggernaut" was released in 2005. In addition, Blackthrone has released a number of demo CD-Rs.
