MorphiuM was formed in 2005 and released their first album in 2008 “La Era de la Decadencia”.
MorphiuM’s music style is difficult to catalogue since it is inspired by a wide variety of musical influences which go from the most extreme metal to the more melodious and melancholic metal.
In 2011 MorphiuM signed with Roadrunner Records’ affiliate in Spain, Kaiowas Records. Global/Mass Records launched their debut album. The first LP was described by the media as one of the best albums of the year receiving a valuation of 9.5 out of 10.
In the same year MorphiuM was named best new act of 2011 by the media and initiated their European and American tour. This enabled them to share the stage with bands like Megadeth, Fear Factory, Overkill, Moonspell, Kataklysm, Destruction, Brujeria, All Shall Perish, Tristania, Dark Funeral and many more well known groups.
Having been on tour from January to April of 2012 the band went on to complete the last leg of the tour in their home country, Spain.
Shortly after they started working on their second album “Crónicas de una Muerte Anunciada” which was completed in July of the same year.
This album was launched in 2013, for which MorphiuM went on to doing another extensive tour in America from May to June, sharing the stage with bands like Anthrax, Motorhead, Suicidal tendencies, In Flames, Six Feet Under, Exodus, Testament, Ill Niño, Suffocation...
After two years of intensive touring they are now working on their third album. Alongside their team, they are developing a new image for the band as well as working on everything involving the presentation of their new record.
