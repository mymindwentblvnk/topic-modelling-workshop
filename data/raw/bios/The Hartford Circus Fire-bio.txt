The sun goes up and it goes down, parallel to our lives, we strive for the unattainable and it haunts our every thought. Too many stuck with what is or what isn't...some things just are and some things may never be understood. Engulfed with emotions...it's more than just a scream and some distortion--It's our passion, our lives, and our feelings displayed through music.
