In 1997 Jukka Rastas and Tatu Hiltunen started to form musical projects that died before they even started. But from their ashes Delusive Grace was formed when Topi Hiltunen and Joonas Poutanen joined the cause. In the beginning the band had problems because their home town could´t offer a decent place to rehearse. For that reason they decided to record their first demo (2002) with drum machine and sequenced bass.
      The situation hadn´t been improved when the time came to record a second demo. Last Breath demo was recorded 2003 in Studio Livsfara with drum machine and Risto ylönen on the bass guitar. After that things started to work and third demo was to be recorded with Joonas Poutanen on the drums. Summer 2005 Delusive Grace recorded demo 2005; again in Studio Livsfara with Risto Ylönen on bass.
