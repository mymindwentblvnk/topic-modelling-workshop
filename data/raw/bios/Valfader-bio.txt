Valfader are a three piece progressive Doom/Stoner Metal band with post metal influences. They formed in the summer of 2010 in Bath UK. Valfader are;
Dean Gaylard - Vocals/ Guitar
Matt Jones - Bass 
Gareth Jones - Drums/backup vocals


Valfaderâ€™s music is designed to transport the listener through the constructs of sonic landscapes, layered with a variety of sounds and conflicting emotions. At the foundations of the tracks are brutal riffs and heavy doom combined with passages of despair and tension. Release from this colossus of tension is offered by the lighter, more melodic passages that offer a hope of overcoming. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/valfader">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
