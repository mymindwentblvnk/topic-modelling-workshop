[1] Voltage (the Netherlands)

"Would history repeat itself and will there be a rockband like Golden Earring having a breakthrough with a hard and simple song called 'Back Home? It ain't easy being a genuine bluesrock band in 2013, but Voltage will cause a shockwave felt by every dutch bluesrocker with this excellent EP." 
-Thomas Spiekerman-

That's what MusicfromNL writes about Voltage's music when the band releases its debut EP Voltage in a fully crowded Muziekcaf√© Helmond in September 2013. 

Voltage's purpose: to show Holland that blues and rock & roll isn't only for the oldies. It's timeless, and you will know it, after seeing a Voltage show. 

The band from Helmond and Eindhoven starts out in 2011 when Dave Vermeulen and Dirk Snellen meet each other on the internet. Big inspirations are icons like Gary Moore, Stevie Ray Vaughan and bands like ZZ Top and Status Quo. Modern blues masters like John Mayer are also very important for Voltage's sound. 

In 2014 Voltage will head into a new direction by getting more into writing their own songs. From January to December 2014, Voltage will release a new song every month to feed their fans with a fine mix of bluesrock. The songs will be recorded at The Supernova Studios in Eindhoven along with producer Bob de Wit. (Radar men from the moon).

Voltage is:
Dave Vermeulen - Vocals/Guitarist
Dirk Snellen - Bass/Backing Vocals
Tom Pijnenburg - Drums
Gijs Heijnen - Guitarist

[2] Voltage (UK)
Voltage is a 21-year-old grime MC from east London whose reputation and success as an early adopter of grime have produced a large and dedicated underground fanbase. This early attention coupled with his recent return to the grime scene has resulted in appearances on national radio stations including BBC Radio 1Xtra, Kiss 100, Choice FM and Rinse FM. Talented and respected, the young artist has been fortunate to work alongside other popular artists such as Maxsta, Scrufizzer, Dot Rotten and DJ Ironik. 
After taking some time away from music to pursue a degree, Voltage is back with a vengeance. In a time when one hears murmurs that grime is being abused as an artform, Voltage has returned to rescue the genre in his authentic style that put him on the map. Signed to LunaKidz Music in 2011, Voltage has produced two new mixtapes of original rhymes and is eager to pursue the even bigger projects to come.
Voltage is incredibly active across multiple social media platforms and overall reaches over 10,000 fans and followers. Follow Voltage online at:
