Ms. Thing (born Nateshia Lindsay on September 15, 1987 in Kingston, Jamaica) debuted in 2004 when she was 17 years old on Beenie Man's smashing dancehall hit "Dude" from Beenie's Back to Basics album. In 2004 she released the Miss Jamaica album featuring fresh jamaican riddims and famous jamaican producer Dave Kelly. Her style recalls other provocative dancehall female artists such as Patra and Lady Saw. During the following three years she released new singles and plans to record a new album in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ms.+Thing">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
