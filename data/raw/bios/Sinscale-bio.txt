Sinscale is an extreme metal band founded in 2009 composed of five musicians all from the west part of France. The influences are broad and range from death metal to black metal and groove metal with an angry edge that will drag you down into a void of liberating destruction! The first demo entitled 'Night Speculations' came out in late 2009, it was self-recorded and mixed by the band. Sinscale is now aiming to gather enough funds to go into a proper studio and record their first full-length. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sinscale">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
