Moonkult was founded in autumn 2011 by Moonlord Akhkharu. A demo called "Tears of Seers" was released in summer 2012.
In the autumn of the same year R.I.P(aka Riku Polameri) joined Moonkult as a session drummer.
Together Moonlord Akhkharu and R.I.P rehearsed and recorded guitars and drums in Sawhill Circle Productions.
Later on Niflungr agreed to record the bass lines for this yet at that point to be released debut album "Profane Nightmare of Seers".
This debut finally was unleashed in April of 2013.
Some time after this Niflungr joined Moonkult as a permanent member and currently more material is being conjured by the same
league of darkness. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moonkult">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
