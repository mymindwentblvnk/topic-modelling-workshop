Rising from the ashes of Chicago-based metal outfit Cursed at Birth, Trifog began as the brainchild of guitarist Justin Anderson (Urethra Franklin and the Ghetto Children) and bassist Dave Katzman in early 2004. The two focused on creating a band that emulated what they admired most about Doom, Sludge, and Stoner Rock. Justin and Dave recruited drummer Chris Wozniak (I Klatus, Lair of the Minotaur), shortly followed by lead guitarist Markus Launsburry (Blood Of Martyrs,Vasana, Nachtmystium). Although they had not yet found the perfect fit for a vocalist, the quartet chose to move forward, and started playing gigs as an instrumental unit. Despite the positive feedback they received during this period, they continued their search for a front man. After auditioning more than 10 vocalists over a period of six months, Trifog finally found what they were looking for in Mark Weiner (Soul Pollution, Power King), thus completing their lineup. 
    Since its inception, Trifog has opened for many notable acts such as Weedeater, Yob, Jumboâ€™s Killcrane, and Negative Reaction, while continuing to carve their niche in the Chicago scene with local Doom-brothers Couldron, Salt of the Earth, and DeepSpacePilots. 
   In March 2006 they unleased their 5 song demo upon the world, and recieved positive feedback from many sources. In early 2008, Trifog's first full length album 'If I Could Change My Ways" was released, and although it also received glowing reviews, Markus left the band for other musical pursuits. The band soldiered on for a while, auditioning and even playing gigs with various replacements, but when no suitable lead guitar voice was found, the band essentially died a premature death.
