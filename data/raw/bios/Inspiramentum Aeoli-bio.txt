The story of IA as a band began on 8th of August, 2005, when brothers Lasarus (guitar/vocals) and Erik (drums) reunited after their previous black metal band split to play slow and depressive sort of extreme - doom metal. At its first steps, the band bursted out with number of concerts around St. Petersburg making quite a name as a doom/death act. But the crew of the band was not stable: people came and went for numerous reasons. But now, it seems, the band has found the members it should involve (on the main photo, left to right: Romulus - guitar, Melna - vocals/keyboard, Johann - bass, Lasarus - vocals/guitar, Erik - drums). The debut EP was recorded a few months earlier the crew has endured its final change and, to be honest, has quite a little to do with what the band does now. During the last half-year the band improved into experimental art doom/death metal act and sees this direction as the future of its development. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Inspiramentum+Aeoli">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
