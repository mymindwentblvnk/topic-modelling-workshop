Capdown are a band from Milton Keynes, United Kingdom. Originally known as Soap, their songs have political themes as alluded to by their name, which is short for Capitalist Downfall. Mixing ska, punk, hardcore, dub and reggae, Capdown built a reputation around their independent releases and numerous tours. Their debut album Civil Disobedients was released by London punk label Household Name Records in 2000, a year in which Capdown played nearly 250 gigs. In early 2001, Capdown toured with a number of established American bands, including Less Than Jake and played the Deconstruction touring festival with Pennywise and Lagwagon. In September 2001, Capdown released their second album, Pound for the Sound, receiving positive reviews from the likes of Kerrang!. The following year saw tours with Bad Religion and Hundred Reasons. In 2003 the band signed to Fierce Panda Records, releasing two EPs: Act Your Rage and New Revolutionaries.

They released a new album on February 5, 2007, entitled Wind Up Toys on Fierce Panda Records.  The album was also released to Fierce Panda Canada on March 27, 2007.
