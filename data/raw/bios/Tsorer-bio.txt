Black metal from Israel, debut full-length album released in 2010. (Tsorer is hebrew for oppressor).

Tsorer was risen in late 2006 in order to unleash raw black metal in the traditions of the old days. Tsorer is a black metal band spilling out their blood from the deepths of IsraHell!

Their influences are heavily old cult stuff from the 80s plus on top psychedelic themes and tunes you have never heard before!
