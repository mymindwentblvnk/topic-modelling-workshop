2014 marked the starting point of Ad Cinerem’s process of creation as a Black Metal project influenced by Funeral Doom Metal and Ambient music. The first songs, which were recorded in the band’s studio, were published under the title of “Once Mourned… Now Forgotten” by GSP Records Russia in early 2015.

As of now, the band are proud to look back on three years of concerts both in clubs and at festivals throughout Europe: Ad Cinerem have played Autumn From Hell Festival, they’ve toured as Special Guest together with Pillorian (Ex-Agalloch) as well as playing the opening concerts of US American metal legends Cobalt’s European tour. 
Studio work for the Full-Length album “Shadows of Doubt” were finished in December 2016. Published via Winterwolf Records, the album was released worldwide in January 2017.

The bands’ shows are characterized by a unique blend of sinister Black Metal and the fragile melancholy of Doom Metal. Spherical guitar riffs merged with vigorous and haunting vocals unleash a musical landscape which describes one’s journey into the pale depths of the human self. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ad+Cinerem">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
