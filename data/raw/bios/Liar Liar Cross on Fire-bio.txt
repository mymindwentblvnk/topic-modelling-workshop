Liar Liar Cross On Fire is a bleak metal band (for pretentious men) from Utrecht, the Netherlands. LLCOF started in February 2007 and quickly built up a repertoire of pissed-off, apocalyptic tunes. After changing drummers and guitarists, the new style evolved into a Wolves in the Throne Room/Neil Perry/Tragedy mixture, presenting a bleak vision of the world to come. 

A new record is in the making, this time gaining more influences from nature, philosophy and modern ambient and avant-garde (pardon our French) black metal, along the lines of Deathspell Omega, Drudkh, Lifelover and the likes. The record has been mixed and is now in the process of being released by Apollon records.

As of now, Liar Liar Cross On Fire is named Terzij de Horde. The new record, "A rage of rapture against the dying of the light" will be released under this new moniker. (www.myspace.com/terzijdehorde)
