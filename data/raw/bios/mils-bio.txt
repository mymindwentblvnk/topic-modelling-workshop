In 1994, four musicians felt like liberating themselves from a formal kind of music. Therefore, that same desire gathered them together in order to create Mils... this desire of research and inventions in music is always amusing. This element remains permanent in their composition from which they reject any kind of formal stability (instrumentation most of all). That's why, according to their compositions, they use the guitares as well as the wind instruments or the electronic instruments and they even mixe them together without complex and with an entire freedom of aesthetic. They have made three albums for the parisian label Gooom Disques and they have colaborated with many other french or international structures (cross, Japan or district six, GB) for their singles or remixes. At the end of 2001, still for Gooom Disques, they have made echotones which is a compilation of many different titles that had been realised between 1998-2001 for different labels.They have created their own world of music where organic sounds are mixted with elaborated electronic music, pop melody and improvisation.
Since their first album, their creations were followed by many musical papers, by mainstream magazines (les inrockuptibles, magic, vibration...) as well as specialized ones (coda, octopus, revues et corrig√©es...). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MILS">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
