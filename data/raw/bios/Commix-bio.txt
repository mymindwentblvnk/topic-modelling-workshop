Commix are George Levings and Guy Brewer, a UK drum and bass duo from Cambridge who have had tracks signed to Goldie's Metalheadz label and Hospital Records.

Commix tracks generally have a light, eerie and experimental feel to them; all tracks on their Call To Mind LP are shipped with the "Progressive Electronic" sub genre to reflect their sound.

Commix are part of The Cambridge Four, including themselves, Logistics and Nu:Tone, to produce NHS74: The Future Sound of Cambridge, released on Hospital Records. As of 2008, all three artists are working on the second edition of this EP, NHS106: The Future Sound Of Cambridge2.
