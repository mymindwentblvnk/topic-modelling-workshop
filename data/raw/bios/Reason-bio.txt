4) Reason (HUNGARY) was founded in 1994 by Attila Horváth, Gábor Dudás and Attila Barna. The early days were characterised by an experimenting attitude towards music, however, in three years’ time the band developed its own style. 

Their first demo was recorded in 1995 under the title “National Porno”, but it was not until the next year, when they finally found their own path with the help of their new keyboard player. At that time the band grew more serious both musically and textually, which is represented in their second demo called “Moonlight”. The material received positive critics in the Hungarian Metal Hammer magazine. Their main influences have always been bands like Type O Negative or Paradise Lost, but at the same time they have been inspired by musicians and artists of entirely different genres as well. 

The following years were predominated by playing in various clubs in the country and in Budapest as well (e.g. Riff-Röff Rockklub). Besides, 2000 saw the birth of their third material called “Broods”, which did not prevent them from having temporarily abandon the band. After a period of one and a half years it became clear for two of the founding members, Gábor Dudás and Attila Horváth that they can imagine their future musical activities only within this band. 

Finally, after a number of changes in the line-up, Reason has reached its present state. In 2005 they finished “Captive of Dreams” and were planning to record their first album. Recently, they have played mainly in Budapest (Marco Polo, Red Hole, Woodoo), but they also had a chance to play in festivals like Night of Doom (in Debrecen) and Gothica V-VI (Petofi Csarnok).

5) Reason (AUSTRALIA)

Having withstood the test of time, Reason continues to personify both tenure and standard as one of Australia’s true veteran’s of the underground Hip Hop scene with 15 years experience under his belt. The Reason story reflects true preservation of his belief in maintaining a constant yet positive presence.

Reason practices what he preaches by promoting positive content in a context that is truly street, yet with a personal message contained within. A lover of graffiti, politics, life and the environment, these are examples of the diversity that the listener envelops into their own conscience. Reason released his third LP 'One Step Ahead' in 2004, following on from Reography (2002) and Solid in 1999. Reason also released the EP “Life’s A Lesson” in 2006, featuring a bevy of international and local guests. August 2008 saw the return of Reason with his latest offering entitled "The Tides are Turning". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Reason">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
