Burn the Ruin is a 5-piece Christian metal outfit based out of Santa Rosa, CA. The band came together out of vocalist Jeff Bateman and drummer Ryan Haugh's disappointment in the lack of faith they saw in today's metal/hardcore scene. The two left their previous band in order to find a way to meld their desire to worship God with their passion for creating music. Not long after, they were joined by bassist Jared Wallace and guitarist Adam Hayman and in late 07, attention quickly began to grow around their fresh new take on metal/hardcore.

Small house shows turned into packed out venues as BTR saw their music take off along with each members growing talent. Ryan's solid drumming combined with Adam and Jared's intricate guitar work serve as a backbone for Jeff's deeply spiritual and personal lyrics. Anchored by driven breakdowns, melodic choruses and a sharp attention to detail, BTR's wide range of musical influences has helped give shape to their unique hybrid of musical styles.

Joined by Kerry Cole on guitar in late 09, the group has worked increasingly hard over their short but impressive careers honing their skills and bringing their music to as many places and people who will listen. Each step forward has only strengthened their faith as each member hopes that their music will lend a hand to those seeking something real in metal/hardcore music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burn+The+Ruin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
