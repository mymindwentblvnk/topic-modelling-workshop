Raw doom-death from Croatia. Hardly anything is known about this band. The only mentioning on the web is on the homepage of Am√©n, according to which they released a demo called "False Belief" in 1997. They also released a demo in 1994 called "Who is the One who stands the most high". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
