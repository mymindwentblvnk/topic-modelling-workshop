Bann is an atmospheric black metal band from Germany, formed by Thurn (music) and Hoffarth (vocals).

Nowadays, the Middle Ages are more popular than ever, for they are probably being taken more notice of than they were in their own era. Literature, film,  television, games, markets, and, not least of all, music are just some of the media dealing with the subject matter in multifarious ways. Unfortunately, their references seem to hardly contain any authentic aspects, but all the more truism. That’s the point Bann is making. Instead of stoking the image of a continuously gloomy or romantic millennium, Bann devoted itself to arranging the authentic but often forgotten aspects and significant details of the medieval world and history musically, and by this means breathe life into the Middle Ages in a unique way.

The project’s conception arose towards the end of the year 2004 from a distinct ardour for history and music and the awareness of proper capabilities of writing and composing. After the advancement of the project’s keynote the two songs "Aber aus der Asche wird ein Schwan entstehen“ and "Allerwachen“ came up. Being produced with modest facilities, they acquired great vogue at the internet platform mp3.de, where they had been provided complimentary. Both songs tied for the first place in the genre’s internal download statistic and received a lot of credit in various panels. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bann">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
