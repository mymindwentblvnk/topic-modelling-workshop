Artisian is a Southampton based 3-piece Death/Black Metal project set up in June '04 by Iain Muir.
The Inspiration for the project was drawn from a deep misanthropy, crushing sorrow, severe depression, emotional and physical pain and frustration resulting from dealing with the average person.  Utter disgust and hatred for modern society and government; the flawed infrastructure in which it rests, a rejection of the politically-correct hypocrites that turn a blind eye to Nazi-style mob censorship and the wailing ignorance of minority groups that cry discrimination when they don't get what.  Thus producing a yearning for self-sufficiency, solitude and the collapse of all organised religions and a return to paganism.

We came into this world alone, we will leave alone.

We are here to survive, sink or swim.  

People can have a prejudice purely because another draws breathe
