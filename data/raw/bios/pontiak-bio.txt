Pontiak may be two different artists:

Baltimore/Virginia-based trio Pontiak is comprised of multi-instrumentalist brothers Van (guitar, vocals), Jennings (bass, keyboards, vocals), and Lain (drums, vocals) Carney.  To date, the prolific Pontiak's releases - two EPs, four full lengths ("Valley of Cats," "Maker," "Sea Voids," and "Living") and a mini-LP, "Sun on Sun" have all been self-produced slabs of guitar-based rock.  The band has grown heavier with each record; "Sun on Sun" was a hybrid of classic- and stoner-rock, with songs running into 10-minute territory and extended instrumental breaks.  2009's "Maker" is even heavier, noisier, and packs a Texas-sized wallop.  Both of the band's more widely-distributed records, "Sun on Sun" and "Maker," have been critically well-received.
