The duo of Hot Chip's Joe Goddard and singer/songwriter Amy Douglas, HARD FEELINGS bring operatic drama to the dance floor. On 2021's self-titled debut, the pair's blend of disco, house, synth pop, and new wave reached cinematic heights.

Goddard contacted Douglas after being impressed by her commanding 2018 DFA single "Never Saw It Coming"; along with her collaborations with Horse Meat Disco and the Juan MacLean, she also worked on Róisín Murphy's 2020 album Róisín Machine. Initially, the pair's collaboration was long-distance, with Goddard sending Douglas tracks to flesh out with melodies and lyrics. The duo hit upon a sweeping sound and mood informed by Puccini arias as well as Eurythmics, the Human League, and Zola Jesus. Realizing they had an album's worth of songs, the pair completed their debut in person in London in 2019. HARD FEELINGS appeared in November 2021 on Domino. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hard+Feelings">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
