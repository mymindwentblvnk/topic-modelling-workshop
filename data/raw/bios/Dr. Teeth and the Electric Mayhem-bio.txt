Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem first appeared on The Muppet Show. Following The Muppet Show, they have appeared in various Muppet movies and TV specials, and have also recorded album tracks. The band proclaims itself to be "the loudest anything anywhere."

The band consisted of Dr. Teeth (band leader and piano), Janice (guitar), Sgt. Floyd Pepper (bass guitar), Zoot (saxophone) and Animal (drums). During the fifth season of The Muppet Show, Lips joined the band (trumpet). Animal, Floyd, Zoot and Janice also played in the Muppet Show pit band, performing the opening and closing themes and underscoring most of the Muppet Show performances. However, Rowlf the Dog was the pit pianist. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Teeth+and+the+Electric+Mayhem">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
