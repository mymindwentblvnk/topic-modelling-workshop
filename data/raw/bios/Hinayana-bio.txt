Hinayana is a melodic metal project from Austin Texas - songs written and recorded by Casey Hurd, who is currently hard at work to get a full band together to play live, write, and record more material this next year.

Hinayana's first demo has been released in August 2014, and is free to stream and download - https://hinayana.bandcamp.com/releases
