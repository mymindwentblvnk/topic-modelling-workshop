2003-2010 (London, UK)

Formed 2003, OutCryFire are a combination of the finest talents of the two great past South Bucks metal bands - Blind Eye Policy and Drexl (previously Seven of Nine).

Drawing on metal influences from Megadeth & Iron Maiden, through to Lamb of God & Meshuggah. OutCryFire serve up a mean array of groove-laden riffage, with hardcore sensibilities & downright pure power.

In 2005 they were short-listed by Kerrang! Magazine as one of the 10 best unsigned bands in the country. To quote - "The A&R men have missed a trick here. OutCryFire possess watertight riffing, military precise drumming and tonsil bothering vocals all wrapped up in the righteous power of metal."

And on top of that, they were recently also awarded the title of BEST UNSIGNED METAL BAND in PlayMusic Magazines 2006 Awards! The band is without doubt proving to be one of the best kept secrets of the UK underground music scene today.

With masses of live experience under their belts, the OutCryFire are guaranteed to get any crowd whipped up into an adrenaline-fuelled frenzy.

Their shows are notorious for being as entertaining, as they are brutally heavy. OutCryFire are a band unafraid to throw in humour & showmanship into their performances, without compromising any of the crushing heavy metal carnage.

Overall, OutCryFire has one very clear aim - to bring the British metal scene back to the forefront of today's music industry. With an absolute abundance of mind-blowing metal acts emerging in the UK right now, it's time to make the rest of the world sit up & notice exactly what were capable of.

 On August 12, 2010 a blog was posted on outcryfire's myspace announcing their official split.
