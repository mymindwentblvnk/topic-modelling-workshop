Riffobia were formed in 2004 by Dimitris Kontogiannis (guitars), Achilleas Theoktistou (bass), Dimitris Makris (drums) and Chris Ntelis (vocals) in Trikala, Greece. The next couple of months the band recorded some tracks in a basement studio with leased equipment, and in spring 2005 they self-released a demo cd with 8 tracks. At the same time they played a couple of live shows in their home city, Trikala.
In 2006 the band was put on hold for a few years mostly because of the job/studying schedules. In summer 2011 all four members came together again and Riffobia was active.

In the year of 2012 they started to work on new songs, played some live shows around Greece and recorded their debut album in Sin City Studios at Thessaloniki. Mastering was made by Apostolos Baltos at Wavespectra and the album was released by Athens Thrash Attack and Secret Port Records in summer 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Riffobia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
