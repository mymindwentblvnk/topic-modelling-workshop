How do you define an artist who has never performed live, nor DJ’ed, nor has never partaken in an interview? By the music of course. Jürgen Paape has proven this time and time again. How? 

Co-owner of Kompakt. The house’s most elusive member remains the un-compromised, untainted shining star. And without ever being there….the one who launched the label with our first release "Triumph“, Jürgen Paape has left a legacy of music that is a true core of the sound which Kompakt’s foundation is built on.

Some of the biggest moments of Kompakt history are from Jürgen. The chorus of “So Weit Wie Noch Nie” remains timeless –there to send shivers of pleasure down your spine as we feel at the end of exhaustive end of a night at Total Confusion. “Take That” is an anthem for the unbuilt rock stadiums of tomorrow. The bona-fide hit that put him in the charts in Australia and Italy is here – “Come Into My Life (Radio Edit)” remains undeniably one of Kompakt’s catchiest pop tracks ever. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/J%C3%BCrgen+Paape">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
