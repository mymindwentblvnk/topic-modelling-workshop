From the ashes of MOLEHILL arose RESIDUE...a more blues rock-based version of Alabama dirge in 2000. The sludgy elements are still there, but with a more seasoned song-writing crew and a wider variety of dynamics. Performing at the Milwaukee Metalfest in 2001 on the Relapse Stage, Residue also shared the stage with such acts as High On Fire, Nebula, Mastodon, Sourvein, Weedeater, Cuda, Suplecs, Electric Wizard, Dixie Witch, and Warhorse. Residue would officially release only one song "Earth", a split 7" track on Berserker Records with Stone Of Abel before breaking up in 2002. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Residue">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
