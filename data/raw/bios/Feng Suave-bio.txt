The music of Amsterdam-based psych pop/soul duo Feng Suave is reminiscent of bygone times when vocals are drowned in reverb and instruments are seemingly recorded under water. Because the soulful vocal melodies, alluding to the 60s and 70s, and punchy, seismic bass lines make for a warm, genre-defying, psychedelic deluge of airwaves embellished with dreamy effects, at times the music sounds more like an audacious attempt to communicate with extraterrestrial intelligence rather than two boys playing pop songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Feng+Suave">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
