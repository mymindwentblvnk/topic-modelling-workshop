Brutal Death Metal band from Växjö, Sweden. 
Erupted was formed in 2010 when a former project of three of the members, called Beyond Hell, underwent major line-up changes and decided to make a new start. The band played several local shows during 2010 and in 2011 they recorded a three-song EP called Faces of Death. Faces of Death was released on June 1st, and sold out in 2 hours.
Their debut album "In the Grip of Chaos" was released on Abyss Records in 2012.

Erupted's musical style is based on old school elements with a modern and progressive touch, as well as an philosophical and occult lyrical element.
