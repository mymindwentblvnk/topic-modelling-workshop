Their music is filled with slow crushing riffs and drumming, the vocals are deep growls. overall the music could be described as depressing and harsh. So far they only have two releases: 'Goat Cvlt" (demo) released in 1998 and 'Solitude' (Full Length) released in 2006 under the VinterHowl autoproduction record label.
