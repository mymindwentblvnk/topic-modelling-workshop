They share similar sounds with Wasteform and Leukorrhea with their speed, blasting and deep vocals.

The band got straight to work on practises and rehearsals in 1995, but having a few line up and directional issues. Thus, their self-released debut full length "Exhumed Rotting" was released in 1997 which made their new modern style mixed with old school way of structure a drawing in factor for brutal death fans. 

The band since released a demo in 2001 called "Butchers Forever", "Serial Butcher! EP in 2002 and their most recent EP "Genocide Landscape" in 2004.
