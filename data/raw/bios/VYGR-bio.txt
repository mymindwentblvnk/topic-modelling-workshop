A sludge and doom metal band from Boston, MA, USA.

Blending the drone and gloom of bands such as Cult of Luna, Swallow the Sun, and Neurosis with down-tuned riffs reminiscent of Crowbar and Old Man Gloom, VYGR (pronounced 'Voyager') adds their own experimental, space-oriented sound to create a crushingly heavy soundtrack for altered states of mind.  

Started in late 2007 as Voyager, the Boston collective released the well-received VYGR EP in 2008, followed by a limited vinyl-only split release with Philadelphia's Monolith in early 2010.  Following two years of conflicting schedules and limited live shows, the group re-emerged as VYGR, and recorded their debut full-length record, Hypersleep, at the Planet-Z studio in Hadley, MA with renowned producer Zeuss (Shadows Fall, Hatebreed, Crowbar) at the helm.  The new album was slated for release in early 2011 through San Francisco-based label Creator-Destructor.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vygr">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
