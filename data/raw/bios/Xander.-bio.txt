Xander is a music producer and vocalist based in Boston whose sound is stimulated by vivid scenery and profound memories. Raised in a small farm town and inspired by an eclectic array of artists (Tame Impala, Flume, Knxwledge), Xabder's focus is on generating newfound feelings with every track. Layering chilling and intimate vocals on top of his own instrumentation, he strives to develop an immersive experience one note at a time. With much more music on the way, Xander continues to craft an innovative sound both expansive and inclusive. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/xander.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
