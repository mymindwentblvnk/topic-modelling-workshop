Depressive Black Metal from Romania.

Sorgnatt is a band from Romania (Sibiu, Transylvania). 

The two members, Hadenskog and Gravstein had long planed to create a music project, an emotionally valuable and musically skillful act even since 2003. Only in 2005 the circumstances were adequate for a first step, thus Sorgnatt name was picked and the first demo was recorded, very fast. "Solitude Before Suicide" had good reactions in the underground scene, especially among the fans of depressive black metal and dark ambient style.

The music sub-style adopted had never been a criterion, it just happened. Sorgnatt does not care for a certain style or trends, rather the belief in their own intuition, feeling and rationale.

At the moment the band acts as a studio project. 

Sorgnatt does not advocate any kind of true current, religion or cool political trend, if it is that we advocate something it is not this kind of things that by long term exposure to them brings nothing but intellectual collapse.
