Swedish band that started out in 1994 as a country/rockabilly band, which then merged with the members of Apache and founded the Weeping Willows. According to their website, " The Weeping Willows have played in cafés for a cup of coffee and they have headlined the biggest Scandinavian festivals. They have stayed the same but they have also changed a lot. They have spread their music further than they could have imagined yet they are still quite anonymous. Variation, just the way they like it. It’s all about the music.
