The following year would see the project release its debut full-length LP, entitled Towards the Depths; as well as split releases with the bands Vorkuta and Drohtnung. A new EP, Sorh, came in 2010; while a second album, Torn Beyond Reason, was released in February 2011. A compilation of the project's earlier work, entitled The Darkest Days, was released in 2012.
