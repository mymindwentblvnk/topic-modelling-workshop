Lucian The Wolfbearer is a Funeral Doom project that was risen in early 2013. Songwriting/Vocals/all instruments done by Sean M Kratz of cleveland's blackmetal Benighten Empire with the intent to give a dark story of mythos and blight to its listeners. As in starting the first album "Void" was acoustic, atmospheric and driven, starting with album " Haunted" was the original plan for the path of this venture of Lucian the Wolfbearer, and will be the main corse to be feed to fans of this haunting Doom Project, lyrically still on parallel mostly with Norse mythos but more darker side of the myths. This project does and in the future will have guest musicians help with some parts. The future has much in store and the stories will unfold. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lucian+the+Wolfbearer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
