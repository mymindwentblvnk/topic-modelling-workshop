Buried Emotion was a Doom/Death Metal band and some of its influences were early Anathema, My Dying Bride, Rotting Christ and Amorphis. They were formed in Athens, Greece in May of 1997. The first line-up consisted of Petros Nikiforakis (guitars), Nikos M. (guitars), Vlassis (drums), Dimitris M. (bass), Giannis B. (vocals) and Ageliki (keyboards). In the summer of 1997 the band recorded the first two songs, "Winter Chant" and  "...Vengeance". Unfortunately, Vlassis was forced to join the army and the band started playing with several drummers until Dimitris S. joined the band in December of 1997. Ageliki left the band as her musical horizons were different from the band's and Giorgos G. took her place.

In early 1998 the band recorded the song "...Vengeance" and remixed the song "Winter Chant". In February of 1998 the band's first Demo CD entitled "Buried Emotion" came out including those two songs. The demo was sent to the greek metal magazine "Metal Hammer & Heavy Metal" and gained the title "Best Demo of the month". The group played live several times and on June 24th 1998 the band's second Demo entitled "Ode to the Unknown" came out. It was in fact the band's first completed material and included two more songs "New Era" and "Last Farewell". After that the band released two more demos, the "Life I Lost" on 1998 and "When The Statue Wept" on 1999. They also appeared in a compilation of the Greek's magazine Metal Invader "Warzone XII" with the song "Life I Lost". Unfortunately they never released a full length album and split up probably in 1999. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Buried+Emotion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
