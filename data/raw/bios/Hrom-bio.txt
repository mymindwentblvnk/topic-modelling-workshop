Hrom { Hrohm } originated sometime in early 2008 with ONLY the idea of creating a Power Metal album. Jan Loncik decided to come up with some riffs which eventually led to recording of all the drums, guitars, and bass in his home studio (Richobo Studios Canada). He began thinking that the music was powerful and energetic enough that it deserved a live environment.

Jan started putting together a band lineup, and eventually had put together a complete lineup consisting of David "Joey" Horrocks on drums, Shawn Vincent on bass and Alex Langill on guitars while Jan sang and played lead guitar. A year and a half later in mid 2010 Jan decided it was time to go full time vocals and gave his lead guitar duties to band friend Matt Ries. Our debut album Blesk has been released under Steel Legacy Records [Greece] and was recorded at Richobo Studios Canada.

Our name "Hrom" is the Czech / Slovak word for Thunder. "Blesk" is the Czech / Slovak word for Lightning.
