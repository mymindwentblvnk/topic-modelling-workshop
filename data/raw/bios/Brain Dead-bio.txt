There have been at least 4 bands named Brain Dead:

(1) -  Formed in late 2010, Brain Dead are an in-your-face and unrepentant heavy metal band from Los Angeles, CA. Integrating speed, ferocity, and melodicism, the band's sound is comprised of their own original branded style. Their songs are inspired by an array of metal sub-genres, with an emphasis in thrash with a punk rock attitude. Since their debut, the four piece thrashers have been relentlessly performing for rapidly growing numbers of loyal fans, and have developed a reputable name for themselves as a premiere live act in Southern California's historic heavy metal scene. With nearly three years under their belts, Brain Dead have already shared the stage with hundreds of bands, and have delivered aggressive live performances with national acts such as 3 Inches Of Blood, Huntress, Death by Stereo, Witchaven, Exmortus, Demolition, Gemini Syndrome, Caulderon, Death Riders, Heretic, & Anger As Art. 

The band recently took residency at Skull Seven Studios in North Hollywood with world renowned metal producer Bill Metoyer (Slayer, DRI, Morbid Angel, Sacred Reich). The result is Brain Dead’s heavily anticipated debut LP ‘INDOCTRINATOR’ set to be independently released thru iTunes on February 4th, 2014. The 7 song metallic blitz weaves together classic metal, early thrash, and the roots of punk, creating a collection of ear splitting neck breakers that will attract fans of Iron Maiden and Slayer as well as Agnostic Front. The album was funded thru Kickstarter with support from fans worldwide, and will serve as the follow up to their self-titled EP released in 2011. 

Brain Dead's accomplishments since their formation have become exceedingly notable. They have won numerous battle of the bands competitions in the Los Angeles area, and have been featured on multiple national & international magazines & radio shows, including a recent feature on The Heidi and Frank Show, aired on popular Los Angeles radio station 95.5 KLOS (2 million daily listeners). The band also placed top 5 in the national heavy metal showcase "Project Independent" where their winning performance at the Whisky-a-go-go on the Sunset Strip was broadcast live worldwide!

In early 2014, Brain Dead will continue their assault on audiences across the nation, with plans for large scale touring in support of the new release, displaying their high energy live attack in full force, and building on their rising fan base.
