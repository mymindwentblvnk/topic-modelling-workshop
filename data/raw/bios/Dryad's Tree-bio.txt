Energy meets melancholy, groove combines with dynamics, atmospheric moments coexist with musical influences from various genres.

Thus Dryad's Tree describes their music that has been flowing through the ears of Munich's metalszene since september 2005. The aim is: Write stirringly thrilling, dynamic music that takes the listener onto a journey deep inside his inner consciousness. Therefor a concept was developed wherein the songs musically describe the topic of Comfort In Silence.

Dryad's Tree have already performed some songs live along with bands like Disillusion and Korpiklaani. Between the live activities Captured In Perplexity was recorded in april 2006 as first demo. Finally in august 2006 the recordings for their debut album Comfort In Silence have begun. The conceptual album contains 9 songs and will be released in spring 2007.

Dryad's Tree combine emotional contrasts in their music and build up a certain musical tension which follows the textual concept of their lyrics. Heavy moments follow melancholic ones. Thereby, the four musicians augment their emotional moments with influences from various genres.
