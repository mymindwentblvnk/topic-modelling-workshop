There is more than one band named Nova Era. 

1. Nova Era is a power metal band originated in early March 2008 in Ciudad Obregon, Sonora, Mexico. Born as a project under the name Jemekroz Demonfall.

Due to the shortage of musicians and different ideologies among them,in the beginning is hard for they to find stability for the constant change of members. Until the day they reach a stable line in which they decide to rename Demonfall Nova Era, by certain beliefs and thoughts of some members, plus it was a name  easier to remember.

Then  the work begins with the composition of the first song that comes out of a riff  of Jemekroz, which was liked by the team.

With the passing of months disputes arise between Jemekroz Bayo, Bayo therefore decided to leave the band in early February 2009 and enters the post Hassan. After finding an improvement in the quality of live performances, they decide they want a guitar based player, so they get Billy, a close friend of David.

For reasons of study Hassan left the band in May 2009 and then enters Alan's younger brother of Jemekroz.
