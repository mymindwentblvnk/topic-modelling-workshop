The Sleeping, consisting of a few of the original members of Long Island's now defunct metalcore group skycamefalling, was formed after skycamefalling's last show at Hellfest '03. Living on after the legacy of SCF - Doug Robinson, Cameron Keym, Sal Mignano, and Joseph Zizzo continue to develop and write music that we now know and love.
With a drastic change from the hardcore scene, the Sleeping is now considered to be post-hardcore/Rock/Alternative, and has played with bands such as Fightstar, Halifax, Silverstein, Bayside, Stretch Armstrong, Spitalfield and Haste the Day. 

On August 6, 2008 the band announced that after 6 months of auditioning for a new pianist/guitarist to replace Cameron Keym, they had recruited Paul Cadena (Guitar) and Christopher Evans (Keyboards/Synths), the newest members of The Sleeping.

The band proceeded to tour across the East Coast and Midwest US with Envy On The Coast and Secret Lives of the Freemasons.

On February 17, 2009, new album What It Takes was released.
