With the upcoming release of their first LP, Synthetic Order, Nihilate plans to overcome the current trends and divisions within the metal community and restore depth and integrity in songwriting and production. With the help of Garth Richardson (R.A.T.M., Mudvayne, Spineshank, Gallows), Scott Ternan (Fear Factory), Joao Carvalho (Black Lungs, Cancer Bats, Protest the Hero, alexisonfire) and other staff and students at the Nimbus School of Recording Arts, Nihilate have created a hard hitting, ear punishing 40 minute war of art. From the deceptively acoustic driven intro Clearance, or the trial of endurance that is Mourn of Hate, to the thrash anthem title track Synthetic Order, this project will prove Nihilate stands above the rest.

In the spring of 2010, Nihilate released the self-produced E.P. Resistance on their own label, From Nothing Records,. It was recorded and mixed at the Metal Ranch in Delta, B.C. by Tom Peterson (Mechanism, Cyanotic). Since forming in 2005, Nihilate has built a reputation as an intense live act, continuously working to strengthen and develop the overall audience experience.

With the completion of Synthetic Order, Nihilate now plans to gain international distribution and tour support to bring their defiant sound to a wider audience. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nihilate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
