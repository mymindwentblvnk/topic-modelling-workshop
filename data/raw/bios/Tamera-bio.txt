Tamera is a London based Singer/Songwriter. Having grown up just outside of London in Gravesend, Kent, listening to the sounds of everyone from to Whitney Houston, James Brown, Missy Elliott to Mariah Carey. â€¨ In 2017 she left the suburbs for the big city and threw herself into a totally new reality. Feeling the distance from friends and family to lean on, like diary entries she poured her heart into her songs when she had no one else to talk to about the trials and tribulations of life and love as a young adult, honing her sound and writing in the process. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tamera">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
