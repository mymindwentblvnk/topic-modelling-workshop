Fear Within is a metal band from Barcelona / Sant Cugat (Catalonia) that combines Melodic Death Metal as the main style with lots of other styles like Thrash Metal, Black Metal, Metalcore, Progressive and more... It was founded by Jordi Bolibar (Karlahan's guitar player) in 2007 as he wanted to create a really personal band where he could write and play all the music he had been composing throughout the years. Later joined Xavi (keyboards) who developed the idea of the band together with Jordi, Toni (growling vocals) who was chosen by Jordi to be the singer of the band since he already knew his talent in the viking metal band "Karlahan" and Marc (guitars)who was invited to join the band due to his talent on the 3 instruments he plays, guitar, piano and violin. The estimated date for the first demo recordings is wether late 2007 or early 2008, and the songs who will be included in the first demo are still to be decided.
