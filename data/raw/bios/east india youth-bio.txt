East India Youth is William Doyle, a multi-instrumentalist from Bournemouth, who cut his teeth in an indie group called Doyle & The Fourfathers when he was 17 while living in Southampton. Their demo was rinsed by Marc Riley on BBC 6 Music and they completed a couple of tours with the Undertones; later, he moved for family reasons to Ruislip in northwest-London. He then named himself East India Youth after the location of his flat in Londonâ€™s Docklands.

After meeting John Doran, founder of The Quietus in 2012, the Hostel EP was released on the publication's newly created label, The Quietus Phonographic Corporation in spring of 2013.
