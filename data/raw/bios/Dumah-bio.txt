There are multiple artists with the name Dumah;

1) Dumah emerged from the frozen forests of central Wisconsin in the winter of 2000 by brothers Chris (drums) and Mason Kurth (bass) with Phil Creswell (guitars/vocals). They performed as one of the few extreme metal bands in the area, refusing to submit to one given metal genre. The lineup was finalized in 2002, with the addition of Crow (vocals), and Alex Vetter (drums). Chris moved to guitar and Phil left the band. Since their inception, Dumah has been gaining attention from fans and the media. Their early releases earned favorable reviews and drew many new fans. Dumah’s latest release, “Forsaken By The Light,” was recorded in early 2006 and represents their best effort yet.

Dumah was well-respected in the Wisconsin scene since its formation in 2000, but sadly broke up in 2007 after personal differences lead to a split.  The members have now gone on to form other bands: Mason and Chris continue in Trollhammer; Crow and Alex continue in the band Solarum Plague; and former member Phil Creswell continues in his project Æthereal.

2) Dumah is a hardcore punk band from San Jose, Costa Rica. They released their debut EP Caida Libre in 2013.
