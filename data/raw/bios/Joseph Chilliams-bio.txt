Joseph Chilliams (real name: Jerrel Chandler) is the older brother of Tahj “Saba” Chandler and a founding member of Pivot Gang. Chilliams’ carefree personality, comic genius, and comfort in his own skin make him an essential part of PIVOT’s dynamic. Growing up, Chilliams biggest musical influences were MF DOOM and Eminem – although today his humorous approach is more akin to Lil B or Ludacris.

Similar to his brother and the rest of Pivot Gang, Joseph Chilliams wears the Westside on his sleeves and also self-produces the majority of his music. In the midst of recording his debut mixtape in late 2016, Joseph Chilliams got mugged while on his way home from the studio. Not only did he lose one of his cheek bones in the mugging, but he actually woke up in the hospital to find out that Donald Trump had won the presidency while he was under. Even today, Chilliams refers to that mugging as a wakeup call for his creativity, crediting it with helping him get over his writing block while crafting his mixtape Henry Church.

Joseph Chilliams’ music is intriguing. It’s both hard AND hilarious, strange AND familiar. In world where music is becoming more difficult to label than ever, Chilliams’ music would probably be best described as Atmospheric Trap. He doesn’t play around when it comes to his bass-lines and he’s got a real talent when it comes to crafting memorable hooks.

Oh yeah, and any article that discusses Joseph Chilliams is incomplete without mentioning his strange, partially one-sided, but very heated beef with Bow Wow, of all people. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joseph+Chilliams">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
