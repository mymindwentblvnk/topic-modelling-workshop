Raven Bitch was a Traditional/Power/Thrash Metal band from Wisconsin, USA. They only recorded the "Tear down the Walls" Ep in 1987, and did some shows before breaking up, obviously way too soon.

Some of the members (Bobbie Bitch & Jim Bean) are still active in the music bussiness, and are working on releasing their solo projects and unreleased Raven Bitch material. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Raven+Bitch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
