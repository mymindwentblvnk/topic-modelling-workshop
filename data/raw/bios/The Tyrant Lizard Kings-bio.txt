Formed in Edinburgh in 2001 by Stu (guitar and vocals), Chris (vocals and bass) and Alex (drums), the Tyrant Lizard Kings quickly got a raw, feedback-laden stoner rock groove going and started gathering a strong fanbase. After a short tour, a line-up change saw Graeme take over on drums. The twisted noise of before slowly began to shift in a new direction, with a more structured take on rock and blues, referencing Motorhead and Karma to Burn. The tunes were now more immediate and catchy hooks began to emerge beneath the riffs. December 2005 saw the release of their first album,"Attack of the Tyrant Lizard Kings", to glowing reviews.

The following years saw the Tyrants playing far and wide in support of their debut, supporting such luminaries as Clutch, Viking Skull, Brandt Bjork, Alabama Thunderpussy and Orange Goblin. They soon gained a reputation for their uncompromising shows, cemented by a formidable live sound and their abrasive sense of humour.

By the end of 2007, writing songs for the next album was the bands main focus. Showcasing a more melodic side, yet still retaining much of their original heaviness, the new material quickly gathered them a wider audience while keeping their established fans more than happy. By June 2008, the guys were ensconced in Chambers Studio in Edinburgh recording their second LP.

With the album "Six Shooter" finished, the band had a launch in February 2009 at Calton Studios in Edinburgh before a frenzied hometown crowd. Gathering momentum and good reviews, the following year will see the Tyrants take to stages countrywide delivering their distinctive brand of sleazy stoner rock to the masses.
