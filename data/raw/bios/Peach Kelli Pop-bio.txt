Peach Kelli Pop is the solo project of Allie Hanlon  who also plays the drums in The White Wires. Peach Kelli Pop plays twee pop, fast and funny songs with lots of tambourine and jangly guitars with childish and sometimes feminist messages in the lyrics. She is based out of Ottawa, Canada. Her first full length album was released on Going Gaga records, which was repressed by Nashville's Infinity Cat Records. It was printed on cassette tape by Burger Records as well. 

She writes and records everything herself. She has had many lineups of people backing her up for live shows such as The White Wires, The Mean Jeans, her twin sister and different friends in Ottawa.

Peach Kelli Pop have released three short albums as of 2015. All of them are available at Bandcamp: http://peachkellipop.bandcamp.com/music
