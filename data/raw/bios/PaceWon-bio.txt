Pacewon is/was part of the Outsidaz group, whose members included Young Zee, and, for a short time, Eminem, which was somewhat related to The Fugees, due to their New Jersey connections. He was signed to Roc A Block for a time, and released the album Won, which is, at least in the opinion of J-Shils, severely underrated.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/PaceWon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
