The self proclaimed ''Scariest Band in the World''. Hailing from San Diego, California, this group of madmen, have taken listeners through the Congo, into the heat of Mexico, the rural highways of the country, and back into the Swamps of the south.

The band consists of guitarist and vocalist Harley Davidson, bassist Robert "RA" MacLean, bassist 3rd Degree Burns, and drummer Bad Time Charlie. Former members of the band include Les Vegas, Tank Johnson and The Phantom (Tom Perry, current 91X DJ and former DJ at WHFS and 92/5). Deadbolt's music combines surf rock, goth, psychobilly and blues sound with unusual and offbeat lyrics.
