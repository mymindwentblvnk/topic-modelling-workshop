Baltimoreans Nathan Bell (ex-Lungfish) and Dave Heumann (Arbouretum) first started playing music together sometime after the start of '99 and definitely before the end of '01. It was soon apparent that they'd hit upon a winning combination - they found an unusual synergy of writing styles that has enabled them, at times, to compose a whole album's worth of songs together in the course of a leisurely afternoon. The style of music that they found themselves playing defies categorization, but has been described by listeners as containing aspects of minimalism, pre-war american blues/folk, and middle eastern and african musics. 
Throughout the past two years, Human Bell has played shows with: the Silver Jews, Bonnie Prince Billy, Joe Lally (ex- Fugazi), Endless Boogie, Warmer Milks, Aminadab, Sir Richard Bishop, Jackie-O MF, Autumn Defense (members of Wilco), Asa Irons (Feathers & Witch), Otto Hauser (Espers), and Tara Jane O'Neil.
Human Bell's first official full-length will be released by Thrill Jockey Records (www.thrilljockey.com) on January 29th, 2008. It was mostly recorded in Selbyville, Kentucky by Paul Oldham. It is available for preorder now. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Human+Bell">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
