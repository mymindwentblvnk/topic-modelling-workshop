"A fine way to start a night of metal" Nick Ruskell, Kerrang Magazine (live review) Formed in Reading, Berkshire at the tail end of 2007, and inspired by their love of Metal, Punk and cult 80's films, Toby Gibbons and Sam Gardner combined infectious riffs and dark humour into the beast that is Mutant Zombie Foetus. Unleashing the EP "Patient Zero" in 2008, and adding Ed Radcliffe to the lineup, MZF quickly began to build a solid local fanbase. A DIY, no nonsense ethic saw them take the initiative, regularly gigging, and self-releasing the "Spread the infection" album. With high profile support slots with the likes of Napalm Death and Malefice, national and local press coverage and the addition of Nick Harding on drums, 2010 sees MZF take their unique sound to a wider audience.
