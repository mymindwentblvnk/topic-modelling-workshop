2-Limited Ediiton is an one-man-project from Finland. Mostly electronic music. Not really a active band - just occasional stuff.

3- Limited Edition is a small band from Townsville, Australia consisting of five middle aged men, who came up with the name 'Limited Edition' from to their lack of availability to play together due to their busy life and family commitments.  They placed 2nd in the NQ TalentQuest in 2004, and four of their songs were featured in a local radio station's 'Local Licks' segment.  Although they wrote many songs together, they only professionally recorded three, and never commercially released anything.  The band broke up in 2005, due to individual commitments.

4- Limited Edition is Orlando Voorn, techno producer from The Netherlands.
