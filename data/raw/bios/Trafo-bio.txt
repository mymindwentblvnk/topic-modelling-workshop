Trafo (A)
Trafo is a good working band in Austria. We are playing in the big concerthalls but for sure in the section of subcultural events. We had the presentation of our last record in the Wiener Konzerthaus, and actually we are working on a new CD with an interesting theme. We are covering some of the very famous television themes and we are making "trafoesque" arrangements for it. TV themes: Munsters, Airwolf, Tatort, Batman, the persuaders, number 6 and others. We will make a interesting collaboration on this record with Noel Akchoté who is a french guitarist (made records with Marc Ribot - Winter & Winter, Derek Bailey, Big Four - Bradley Jones, Steve Bernstein, Max Nagl - Hathut.) We will finish the recordings for this CD in spring 2008.

Trafo (CZE)
Trafo is czech alternative band from Brno (Czech Republic). They are inspired by 90's alternative generation called "Brněnská alternativa" (transl. Alternative of Brno), like Dunaj, Pluto, Ylo Africký Slon, etc. Formed in 2009, performed in Brno, Olomouc and Břeclav multiple times. In 2014 they reunioned after Petr Cígl (Ylo Africký Slon) joined them as drummer. Tomáš then left due the lack of time and Petr left after he decided to go his path elsewhere. Now the young prospect from Prague - Oťas Žáků - is playing the drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trafo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
