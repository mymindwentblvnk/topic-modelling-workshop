Amy Shark is the performance alias of Amy Billings, a singer and songwriter of angsty, atmospheric indie pop from Gold Coast, Australia. 

After quietly making music for several years, she entered a song in the Queensland Music Awards and ended up winning the pop category. She then began touring nationally and received an arts grant that allowed her to work with producer M-Phazes on her song "Adore." The single was well-received on radio upon release in 2016 and went on to become a Top Three hit in Australia in early 2017. 

Shark signed with Sony Australia's Wonderlick label, and her official debut EP, Night Thinker, entered the country's albums chart at number two a few months later. The album garnered six Aria Award nominations and took home two, including Best Pop Release and Breakthrough Artist. 

In 2018, Shark issued her first full-length effort, Love Monster. ~ Marcy Donelson <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Amy+Shark">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
