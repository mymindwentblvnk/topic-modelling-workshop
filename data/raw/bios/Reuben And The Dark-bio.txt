Reuben and the Dark is a Canadian indie folk band from Calgary, Alberta. Led by singer and songwriter Reuben Bullock, the band also currently includes Shea Alain (guitar/keys), Brock Geiger (guitar/keys), Ian Jarvis (bass), and "Pico Pollo" Dino Soares (drums).

The quartet weaves together sounds and vocal harmonies to create unexpected textures that find ways of translating the confusing language of emotion into song and melody with a sound that is both ancient and uniquely contemporary.

The full band's debut album Funeral Sky, produced by Christopher Hayden (of Florence and the Machine) and Stephen Kozmeniuk, was released on Arts & Crafts in 2014.

In 2018 the band released their second album Arms of a Dream, as well as a cover of The Tragically Hip's "Bobcaygeon" as a charity single to benefit the Gord Downie and Chanie Wenjack Fund. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Reuben+And+The+Dark">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
