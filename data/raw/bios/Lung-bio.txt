There are multiple artists called Lung.

1)  James Ellaway, aka Lung, started his musical career in a hardcore band at 16. The Cardiff based producer made his move to drum and bass after getting hooked on the sounds of DJ Marky and Black Sun Empire and soon earned himself a residency at long running Cardiff drum and bass night, Aperture. In 2011, he released his debut track, Relapse'on Med School, which earned him a deal with the label and the release of his album Why Does Anyone Ever Do Anything?

2) Lung is a powerhouse rock duo comprised of Kate Wakefield (electric cello and vocals) and Daisy Caplan (drums). Their sound is thick, dark and commanding, evoking the driving sludge of early grunge/post rock with layered sinister undertones. Kate Wakefield is a classically trained opera singer and Daisy Caplan was a key member of the rock band Foxy Shazam. 

Playing shows from Nelsonville Music Festival to famed DIY venues like 924 Gilman Street, Lung have made their presence known and developed the reputation as a “must see” band. Since their first performance in April 2016, the band has played over 500 shows across North America and just finished up their first European tour.

They have shared bills with artists such as Le Butcherettes, Screaming Females, Big Business, Brainiac, Fucked Up, Priests, Machine Girl, Shellshag, The Messthetics, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Downtown Boys, GRLwood, and Street Sects.
