New wave band from Sarajevo. 
Their first album "Rampampila" was recorded in January 1981 at studio "Tetrapak" in  Split and produced by Ranko Boban. Band members were: Negra Bulbulija (vocal), Neven Đokić (guitar), Mirza Hajbić (bass), Damir Misirlić (keyborad) and Dubravko Smolčić (drums).
Interesting thing is that most of the lyrics were written by Duško Trifunović and arranged by Narcis Vucina. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Radio">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
