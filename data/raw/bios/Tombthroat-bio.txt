Tombthroat developed 1996 from a Black Metal band in which Alex (drums) and Bj√∂rn (guitar) made noise before. At this point of time Tombthroat was a pure Grindcore band. After founding member Dirk (guitar / vocals) left and Evil Ass joined as the new vocal frontpig, the musical spectrum became much bigger. Our first demo-tape was recorded in 1999. It became a real cruel grind monster but isn't available anymore (we hope so!). After recording the tape, our bass-terrorizer Stefan Analmastersadofuck left the band because of female oppression. From this day on the Tombthroat bass misery began. In the meantime Evil Arn(Coming Down) played for us (we guess for two weeks...). After a while Ewool (ex-Disembowled, now Fragments Of Unbecoming) joined Tombthroat. Then we recorded our first CD "Evil Fuckin' Zombie Riot" in 2000/01. It was recorded in our own studio of our drummer Evil Al. The problem was that no one of us was able to use the whole equipment properly. So in the end we weren't very pleased with the result. Nevertheless it was a quite good (and fuckin' hard in your face) debut. After the recording Ewool left the band, our bass section was vacant again. A real hard time without any live gigs and new song material began. At that time Tombthroat was real down. Evil Knut from Muendo Muerto (brute force Thrash Metal from Mannheim) helped us for a while. At least we found Peter, who tortures the bass now, to complete the line-up. Now, Peter plays the second guitar and we are searching for a new bass player. Finally we could play some shows again with bands like Master, Veneral Disease, Fragments Of Unbecoming, Legacy and of course Vital Remains. We also wrote some real cool songs and got more and more into the studio equipment, so the next record seems to become a real fat skullcrushing attack. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tombthroat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
