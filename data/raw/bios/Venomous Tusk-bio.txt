Venomous Tusk is a four piece Rock n'  Metal band from Vancouver BC that believes in the power of a great riff. Formed in 2006 Venomous Tusk has released one ep ( The Morbid Adored) which captured the band in a very raw state. After a major lineup change in 2008, Venomous Tusk is going stronger than ever, expanding on their original sound to bring an even tighter and more complex style to the table for their next offering.
