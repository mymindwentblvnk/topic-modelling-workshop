Industrial metal band from Massachusetts, created in 2014. They intend to bring back the old industrial metal style with influences ranging from Fear Factory to Godlfesh to Die Krupps. The musical style is a mix of industrial and death metal mixing all of out influences into one and creating their own style. 

The band was started by Glen Mitchell (Aggressive vocals/lyricist/music) and Nate Exx Gradowski (All instruments and music unless noted otherwise/clean chorus vocals).

The I.A. initials are a turn around on A.I. (artificial intelligence) in which the band members have an interest in.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Isolated+Antagonist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
