Blue Roses was a project of British singer-songwriter Laura Groves based inShipley, UK. The project débuted with an eponymous album, "Blue Roses" (Apr 2009, XL). She now records as Laura Groves. 

Live gigs were played with guitar & piano and included appearances with Final Fantasy, Jeremy Warmsley, Jeffrey Lewis & Tilly and the Wall. She contributed "Bridges" to the “50minutes” charity compilation (Oct 2006, EXERCISE1), with Daniel Johnston, Ladyfuzz & Emmy the Great.

Groves used the name from November 2008, writing in her MySpace blog "As I've been recording and working on new things throughout the year I feel like I'm in a different place musically to when I started out, so it seemed appropriate to become something new".
