White Magic is an American psychedelic folk rock group based in Brooklyn, N.Y., led by singer/guitarist/pianist Mira Billotte.

The band's original lineup comprised Billotte on vocals and piano, drummer/bassist Miggy Littleton, and guitarist/drummer Andy Mcleod. Billotte played drums and sang in Quix*o*tic with her sister Christina (of Slant 6 fame); Littleton once played in Blood on the Wall & Ida; and McLeod also played in California Speedway. For a couple of years, the band played in New York. They soon appeared on a United Bamboo compilation. Drag City signed them in 2003, and in 2004, they released the band's Through The Sun Door EP to general critical praise. They toured the U.S. opening for like-minded folk musicians Will Oldham and Brightblack Morning Light in 2004 (when the latter band was still known as Brightblack).

In 2005, the group appeared on a free split EP, sponsored by Tylenol; it featured three songs each by White Magic and indie rock band The American Analog Set. Throughout 2005, Billotte performed as White Magic accompanied by guitarist Sleepy Doug Shaw. White Magic's current lineup's core consists of these two musicians, aided by an array of friends/musicians of similar musical aesthetics.

On November 14, 2006, debut album Dat Rosa Mel Apibus was released on Drag City Records. While the band has yet to follow up with a sophomore album, it did release the I'm Hiding My Nightingale EP in 2015.

Billotte's alto has earned her comparisons to Grace Slick, Karen Dalton, Beth Orton, Dawn McCarthy (of Faun Fables), and Nico. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/White+Magic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
