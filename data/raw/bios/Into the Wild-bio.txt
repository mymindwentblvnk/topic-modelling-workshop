Into The Wild - Osnabrück, Germany
Stoner Metal/Heavy Blues Rock

This young stoner metal band hailing from Osnabrück, Germany, will quickly conquer the ears and hearts of any audience with their gripping and passionate live performance.

This passion did not only give them the chance to play with idols such as AIRBOURNE, SEPULTURA, RED FANG and TRACER, but also to show their ever growing fan base the way back to their inner wild.

Dominating, raw bluesy vocals meet chunky, yet refined riffs which, in conjunction with an untamed rhythm section, deliver catchy songs yet without equal.

These five up-and-coming musicians are hell bent to make stages shake all across Germany.
Felix Franke - Vocals
Niklas Giese - Bass
Nils Bensmann - Leadguitar
Lee Frederick - Rythmguitar
Massimo Kuck - Drums
