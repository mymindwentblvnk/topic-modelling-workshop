[2006]:

In the early of 2006, some good old Friends wanted to revive their fond desire, to make a metal band! After the first attempts, and seeking for the members to play with, in the September 2006 the band was lined up! We’d started to practicing, and provide the amps for ourselves!

[2007]:

In 2007 the band was dashing over, with writing the lots of new songs, and refining our abilities so far as we could! We had our first show [Kisujszallas - 26th May], and another two after a while [Esztergom - Molothow - 30th Nov], [Szentes - Delelo - 8th Dec]! During this period, we’ve decided to record our songs, and make a DEMO CD from these! The band was in studio in October-early November, and made the four songs [three tracks, and an outro], what You can listen on this site too!

[2008]:

The show is going on! We had some gigs in this year too, and we want to make lots of them in the future! The Public, and the welcome is amazing, so we are excited in the shows indeed! In our plannings, there are more gigs on abroad! BYF MERCH IS AVAILABLE! [with CDs, TEEs, and badges]

Keep an eye on us, and spread the word!
