Scorn is an Electronic / Dub / Experimental outfit fronted by Mick Harris (and from 1992 to 1994, Nik Bullen). On November 10th of 2011, Mick stated Scorn was put to bed.
Since 1994 Scorn has been the one-man project of former Napalm Death drummer Mick Harris. Musically, much of the output has been minimalist beats with an emphasis on very deep basslines, often resembling dub and trip-hop in structure. Despite these resemblances, Scorn is often associated with industrial and experimental music, and is considered a rare example of a successful industrial/downtempo crossover artist. Scorn is recorded in Mick Harris' home studio, "the box". Prior to the release Gyral, Scorn was a two man project with Harris and bassist/vocalist Nicholas Bullen.  In fact, the first Scorn album, Vae Solis, featured a reunion of the three members of the original Napalm Death line up: Harris, Bullen, and Justin Broadrick, who played session guitars.  Early Scorn had a very dubby, metal sound.  Bullen was ejected from the band after a personal incident with Harris' friend, and Harris changed the focus of the band to what it is known now.
