Nexdeus, a mix of black metal, death and progressive influences. We have decided to focus meticulously on music and that which we write to bring back metal and its variations to the music scene. With brutal and intense drumming combined with technicality of not only guitar riffs but musical inclination can a band truly find a purely original sound and tone. With keys played as a major part of the structure within our music, we hope to push our limits as a band to create something that will usher in a new age of blackened metal.
