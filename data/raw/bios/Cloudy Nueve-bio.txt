Originally from Raleigh, North Carolina, Xavier DeQuan Dennis (June 28, 1993 â€“ December 25, 2019) first began writing music at age 19 under the name McCloud, a moniker derived from his favorite Super Smash Bros. character Fox McCloud. This later evolved into the stage name Cloudy Nueve (Cloud 9, "nueve" being nine in Spanish). His music blended unique melodies and soulful lyrics about growing up in the streets. He was heavily influenced by Mac Miller's candidness and OG Maco's unorthodox vocal deliveries. Dennis passed away in December 2019 due to an overdose. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cloudy+Nueve">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
