Diprosus is an Australian sludge/thrash metal band hailing from the grand city of Melbourne. Starting in 2008 as a two man experiment in the virtually deserted halls of the thrash empire, they quickly swelled and gained momentum, writing decent length songs on topics ranging from warfare to strange poisons to beastmen enslaving the human race. Their brutal and pounding rhythms and chunky groove-and-thrash style riffs melt faces on a daily basis, and are complimented by brawny vocals and gnarly bass lines that rumble the bowels of satan himself. Much about this band screams extreme. They are currently working on recording their debut ep, which is due for release in early 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Diprosus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
