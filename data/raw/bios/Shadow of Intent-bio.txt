Shadow of Intent is an American metal band based primarily in Milford, Connecticut.  The band was formed in 2014 as an internet-based project between vocalist Ben Duerr and instrumentalist Chris Wiseman. They released their first EP called "Inferi Sententia" on July 18, 2014 and continued writing more music for the album that would be called "Primordial". The band currently consists of Ben Duerr (vocals), Chris Wiseman (Guitar, Synth), Bryce Butler (Drums), and Andrew Monias (Bass). In 2015 the band started releasing more songs and followed up with full length album "Primordial" on January 10, 2016 which rapidly started gaining traction on the internet. Over the next year the album "Reclaimer" was written and the lineup changed gears adding live members to perform in the music videos and eventually live shows. 

The second studio album "Reclaimer" was released independently in 2017, selling 1,300 copies in its first week, and to this day has amassed over a million streams. In October the band announced its debut performance in December which would sell out the Webster Underground in Hartford, CT. Shortly after, the band was recruited by JJ Cassiere of the booking agency 33 and West. He started putting the band on national tours with metal acts such as The Black Dahlia Murder, Whitechapel, Carnifex, Oceano and Fleshgod Apocalypse. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shadow+Of+Intent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
