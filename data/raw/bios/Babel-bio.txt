1) Babel like "Bay-bull". Not "bar-bell" or "babble", were born in Bristol in the UK. Babel "started out all kind of small, folky & a bit shy, but then fell in dirty love with pounding tamborines and volume knobs." Songs led to concerts, concerts led to the recording two self-financed EPs, 'The Golden Acre EP' & 'The Arc EP'. Both were sold from tables in tiny venues. Some of which reached places far beyond their own postcode.

In 2007, People Tree Records of London, UK released the majority of their two EPs to the world on one reasonably priced compact disc & weighty slab of vinyl. Babel also contributed to MOJO magazine's August 2008 cover-tribute of the Beatles' "White Album," with an energetic, cheeky take on Mc Cartney's "Why Don't We Do It In The Road?"

2) Baby Dolls (Surabaya) come back with Name BABEL and BABEL name is actually a human tower built as a symbol of human pride and arrogance towards the Almighty, the story is on the book of Genesis in the Bible, the periods before the Prophets there. But this does not mean we are a Christian Metal, because song track will focus on strengthening the heart and the human spirit which began to weaken (like a hardcore... band lyric hell) but still feels, will we still keep the dark and absurd.
we came up with something new, different, offering color and the perception of voicing a positive things, love and build the spirit of life which was considered attack individual whose growing weaker each day. Our desires are driven to help others through our lines (lyrics and musical). Here they are, people who had a vision to make a better world.
