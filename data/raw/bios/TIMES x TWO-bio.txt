TIMES x TWO is a duo from East Auckland, New Zealand created by Arshad Cader (Cade'r) and Zaidoon Nasir (Zee The Guy). They formed their group late in 2011 and have since then generated an exceptional following. Being fully independent, the two write their own lyrics, produce instrumentals, direct music videos, and manage themselves. Their sound has been described as chill, old school, and vibrant hip hop, which is no surprise as they are influenced by artists such as Outkast, A Tribe Called Quest, Pharrell, Kanye West and more. TIMES x TWO also have a good reputation when it comes to live performances, having performed at many cities around New Zealand such as Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Gisborne & more.
