The Austrian black metal band Iseghaal was founded in Autumn 2005 by Lord Drakanus(Bass, Vocals), sAv(Guitar) and Sodium(Drums).
The sound of this trio from Salzburg is heavily influenced by Abigor and true minimalistic norwegian black metal acts.
In 2006 the band released their first demo 'Rising Demo-ns'. A few months later sAv decided to quit the band and became replaced by Noricum.
