1. Heavy/stoner metal band based in England and Germany. Released their debut album "Light the Night, Feed the Flame" in April 2015.

2. On January 1st, 2008,  Jared Markson, David Conklin and a few of their friends were celebrating the New Year. Their friends suggested a competition to see who could write the best song in 15 minutes. So David and Jared went to work, and in 15 minutes, they produced their first song, "Kill Yourselves," which was basically intended to put down the three guys who challenged them.

They proceeded to write many other songs ranging in style from folk to punkish upbeat alternative. But their lyrics are always comical.

Brothers of the Head is not to be confused with "The Bang Bang" which is the band featured in the British movie "Brothers of the Head" where their name was derived. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brothers+of+the+Head">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
