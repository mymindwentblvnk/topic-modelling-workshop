Organized Konfusion was an alternative hip-hop duo from Queens, New York.

Band members Prince Po and Pharoahe Monch began their career as Simply 2 Positive and then signed to Hollywood Records for 1991's Organized Konfusion. The album was commercially unsuccessful but critically acclaimed, as was the follow-up, Stress: The Extinction Agenda (1994) and the duo moved to Priority Records for the concept album The Equinox in 1997.

Monch has also launched a successful solo career, highlighted by his album Internal Affairs. Prince Poetry released The Slickness in 2004. A reunion album remains a distinct possibility. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Organized+Konfusion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
