Purefilth is a band from Stakhanov, Ukraine. While their earlier material was under the deathcore genre, the band decided to go heavier and currently they combine slam death metal with deathcore, as evident on their most recent releases.

While still an up and coming band in the Ukrainian death metal scene, the group has acknowledged a minor fanbase since their formation in 2004. They currently have plans to release a full-length album.
