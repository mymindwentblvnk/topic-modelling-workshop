There are several bands with this name:

1) Order 66 is a grind and powerviolence influenced (very loud) hardcore trio from Cincinnati Ohio. Angst filled and hateful. Brings to mind bands such as Crossed Out, Tragedy, Bucket Full of Teeth & Ampere. Weird ish combo.

2) Order 66 is a danceable pop/punk quartet that write music that happens to be about Star Wars, with having fun (and supplying their listeners with fun) being the first priority.  They don't want the Star Warsy nature of their lyrics to put people off, and hopefully it won't, but it'll add depth for fans who might get some more obscure references. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Order+66">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
