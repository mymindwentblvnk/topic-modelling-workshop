Once Beloved formed in the summer of 2004. In the summer of 2004 drummer Ben Kashmanian and guitarist Phil Bonk and Tyler Stroetzel started playing music together to get away from the stresses of their other bands they were in. Phil and Ben went to high school together and knew Tyler from going to local shows. After a couple of jams the three had a few solid songs. More songs were developing so Ben asked fellow high school chum Mike Grant to check out their practice being the two were in a previous band together. Mike liked what he heard and then was ask to join on vocals. Things started to get rolling between the four. Tyler then asked longtime friend Jeffrey James Hannifan to join on bass and Once Beloved was formed. The guys wanted to take the next step and record an EP. So they spent 2005 recording whenever their schedule permitted them. During that time the band has played various show across New England. They played with such national acts as As I Lay Dying, Killswitch Engage, Byzantine, All That Remains, The Acatia Strain, Diecast, Halo Of Locust (Randy Blythe LOG) etc. The band has also played such national venues as the Worcester Palladium, Hartfordâ€™s The Webester Theater and the Hippodrome in Springfield. Once Beloved's debut EP was recorded by Wayne Krupa, Ben Jon, Joel Stroetzel, and Adam Dutkiewicz and was mixed and mastered by Adam Dutkiewicz. The self titled EP was released in February of 2006 on Devils Head Records.It's available at local record stores or you can order it through www.devilsheadquarters.com.
