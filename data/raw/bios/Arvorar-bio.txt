Arvorar was formed during mid-2009, by Arthur from Blumenau, Santa Catarina, Brazil. At the beginning, the idea was to just be a dark ambient side-project, unknown without any commitment. The next stage, the sound changed to adapt to guitars and vocals which is explored via the avenues of ambient and black metal music. 
In 2012, after releasing the album Fragments of Solitude via Domestic Genocide Records, Arvorar has splitted up. Arthur continued his work in ambient post-metal project Luft Darshan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arvorar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
