Freakeys is an instrumental progressive metal album released October, 2006 formed by Angra's and Hangar's members. The name is a combination of freak and keys, being keyboardist FÃ¡bio Laguna the album composer.

The album is compared to Liquid Tension Experiment not only because of the music style, but also because all members are from a single band except one - in Freakeys, Eduardo Martinez is not from Angra. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Freakeys">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
