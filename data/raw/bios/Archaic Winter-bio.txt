Archaic Winter is a blackened death metal project that uses menacing guitar tones and a vocal delivery that is aggressive and haunting. The lyrics focus on the harsh realities of death and religion. The first album "The Psychology of Death" was released on Metalbolic Records and received many great reviews from the underground metal world!

After many years of dealing with the tribulations and idiosyncrasies of fellow band members, it became obvious that creating music in a traditional band setting with other musicians would only lead to disappointment and ultimately become counterproductive. USA Guitarist Gregory Maupin (Sorrows Quest) formed Archaic Winter as a Blackish Death metal studio project in the winter of 2006. 

The first album "The Psychology of Death" was released on Metalbolic Records with Peter Hasselbrack of Bloodsoaked on vocals. The album received many great reviews from the underground metal world! The bandâ€™s progress slowed for a few years but this allowed Maupin to concentrate on composing and the result is a new demo called DEMON!

Archaic Winter places no boundaries on its music. The band uses menacing guitar tones that are influenced by Black, Death, Thrash and even Classic Metal. The same can be said for the diverse vocal delivery. New Peruvian vocalist Luis Landeo (2012) is a diverse vocalist that combines high Black Metal shrieks with lower guttural growls (with occasional clean vocals); the result is an aggressive and haunting experience for the listener. The lyrics focus on the harsh realities of religion, death, and the end of the world to come.
