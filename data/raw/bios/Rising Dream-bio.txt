Rising Dream could be described as a female fronted power/death band, but their music and stage interpretation incorporates many musical genres and puts the band among those bands you'll most certainly notice, both musically and visually. After the shows at the major open air summer festivals, Rising Dream continues to work on their new songs. For the next album Rising Dream taps producer Rickard Bengtsson (Arch Enemy, Testament, Opeth, Firewind...), so expect nothing less than the best!
