Disqualia was an all-female metal band from Toukyou, Japan formed by three former members of the all-female metal band DESTROSE in 2015. On January 27, 2017, bassist MAI left the band due to suffering anxiety attacks before live performances. On July 11, 2017, vocalist IBUKI left the band citing no desire to lead the group which effectively dissolved the band completely.
