The Fresh & Onlys are a garage pop band from San Francisco, California.  They have several releases on Castleface, Dirty Knobby Records, and a few more coming, one namely on Woodsist. 

"With their hallucinogenic brand of garage rock and eerie backing vocals, The Fresh and Onlys are reminiscent of San Francisco's earlier Haight & Ashbury ancestors. Their music takes it easy and lets the rock-out take a backdrop to their swooning, heavy- set garage rock vocals, simple but strong chord progressions, all coated in droplets of keyboards and undemanding drums. They are set to tour with Thee Oh Sees early this year and have opened for psychedelic soul legend Rodriguez." - Caroline Partamian
