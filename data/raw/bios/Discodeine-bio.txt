Discodeine are Benjamin Morando and Pilooski. They have already released two acclaimed EP's on Dirty, and a few remixes (for Metronomy, Bot'ox, Photonz...). 
Their tracks have been tracklisted on prestigious compilations (Fabric, Robert Johnson..). They are now working on their third EP and thinking up some weird collaborations for their forthcoming album.
