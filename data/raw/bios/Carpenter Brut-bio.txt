Franck Hueso, better known by his stage name Carpenter Brut, is a synthwave/electronic music artist from Poitiers, Nouvelle-Aquitaine, France. Little personal information is known about him aside from his origin. His anonymity is a deliberate artistic choice in order to place more importance on the music itself rather than the identity of the musician behind it.

He first released the initial three EPs, which were collected together and released together under the title Trilogy in 2015. In 2018 he released Leather Teeth, the first part of a promised new trilogy. He has also contributed original music to a variety of soundtracks.

He started writing music as Carpenter Brut with the intention of mixing sounds from horror films, metal, rock, and electronic music. He has toured the United States and Europe, and in 2016 he toured the US with the Swedish heavy metal band Ghost. He performs live with guitarist Adrien Grousset and drummer Florent Marcadet, both from the French metal band Hacride. According to Tobias Forge of Ghost, Carpenter Brut has also produced some albums by the French black metal band Deathspell Omega, who are also from Poitiers. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Carpenter+Brut">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
