Scarlett Johansson (born November 22, 1984 in New York) is an American film actress and singer. 

In October 2006, Johansson signed to Rhino Entertainment's Atco Records. Her debut album Anywhere I Lay My Head (released May 20, 2008) consists of cover versions of ten Tom Waits songs along with one original track. 

Her second album, Break Up, with Pete Yorn, was released in September 2009.

In 2015, she formed the all-girl superpop band The Singles with Este Haim, Julia Haltigan, Holly Miranda and Kendra Morris. The group were forced to change their name shortly after releasing their first single Candy, as established rockers The Singles filed a lawsuit against the group for using the same moniker. The band then re-formed as Sugar For Sugar, minus Haim.  

Johansson has also lent her vocals to various film soundtracks including Chasing Ice, Her, The Jungle Book, Sing, Sing 2  and Wretches & Jabberers <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Scarlett+Johansson">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
