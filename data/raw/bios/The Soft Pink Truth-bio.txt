The Soft Pink Truth (SPT) is the solo alter ego of Drew Daniel, one half of celebrated Baltimore-based electronic duo Matmos. The project's creation came about in 2001, after UK house producer Matthew Herbert had dared Daniel that he couldn't produce a decent house record. The result was three EPs and the 2003 debut album "Do You Party?". This was followed by the album "Do You Want New Wave Or Do You Want The Soft Pink Truth?", which consisted of electro covers of UK (post-)punk and American hardcore songs. 

The Soft Pink Truth went on an extended hiatus due to Daniel being preoccupied with academic work and Matmos, until the project resurrected in 2014 with a new album "Why Do The Heathen Rage?", bearing the subtitle "Electronic Profanations Of Black Metal Classics". SPT's latest release is the 2020 album "Shall We Go On Sinning So That Grace May Increase?".  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Soft+Pink+Truth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
