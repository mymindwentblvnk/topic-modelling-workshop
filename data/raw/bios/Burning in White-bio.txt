BIO
Burning In White are a Melodic Deathcore/Metal band from the South Eastern Suburbs of Melbourne. BIW began as a Metalcore quartet in 2009 under an alternate alias and achieved moderate attention. After various member changes and reputable supports for such bands as Psycroptic and Blooduster, BIW was re-born in late 2011, adopting a more aggressive, Death Metal inspired sound with melodic hooks. In June 2012, they errupted in the studio to record their debut demo â€˜Omnicide'. Burning In White mixes technical down tuned guitars, fierce blasting drums, thundering heavy bass and high screeching/low guttural vocals with high onstage energy that produces a force to be reckoned with. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burning+In+White">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
