Ohio-bred rap producer Jerry Cruz (aka 16yrold) makes beats for some of the freshest young artists emerging from America's rap underground. Early in his career Cruz remained something of a mystery, preferring to keep his online presence defined by his SoundCloud and Instagram accounts alone. By reaching out online, Cruz managed to produce for musicians all over America, including early collaborations with SahBabii, D Savage, Lil Yachty, and Desiigner. 16 was a member of 808 Mafia from 2015 to 2016. In 2016, he founded the label Crisis Club, which was renamed to SIG (SoIcy Goth) in 2018. 16's alias is SIG.Carlito. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/16YROLD">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
