Formed in mid-2010 in Perth, Western Australia and comprising primarily of former members of Perth thrash outfit Kingdom of Ruin, Gates of Perdition are set to take the Australian Metal Scene by the horns. Bringing a unique melodic thrash style, incorporating elements of groove and death metal, Gates currently split their time between local shows and writing new material.

Influenced by the Melodic Death metal of the Gothenburg region as well as the recent resurgence of Melodic Death and Thrash metal music in the US, Gates of Perdition combine ultra-tight melodic riffs with solid drums and mature song writing.

Lineup:

Rob D'Ermilio - Vocals, Guitars
Leigh Kapor - Lead Guitar
Cale Wilson - Drums
Sam Green - Bass, Vocals
