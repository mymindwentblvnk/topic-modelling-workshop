“Do you feel alone right now? - Oh, I dunno. I mean I'd like to believe I'm not but I just... I've just never seen any proof so I... I just don't debate it anymore, you know? It's like I could spend my whole life debating it over and over again, weighing the pros and cons and in the end I still wouldn't have any proof so I just... I just don't debate it anymore. It's absurd. - The search for God i
s absurd? - It is if everyone dies alone.”

- Donnie Darko, 2001

Everyone Dies Alone is a Technical Deathmetal band hailing from Antwerp, Belgium.
The band claimed its place on earth in 2007 with the count of 6 members, who all share a great passion for the heavier kind of music. By producing a diversity in sound, they try to amaze the spectators by switching from a fast blast beat into a more melodic texture, finishing it all off with a brutal breakdown. This hurricane of sound is empowered by fierce grudges, low pitch vocals and spine chilling high pitch vocals.

Inspired by bands such as: The Black Dahlia Murder, The Faceless, Beneath The Massacre, Impending Doom, Job For A Cowboy, … they try their very best to give the audience a memorable show, and try to let them have as much fun as they have while performing on stage.

At the end of March 2010 they finished the recordings of their debut album “The Arcane Army”.
An album that contains a lot of hard work and persistence. With this album they hope to show the world what they are musically capable of. But still they seek to push their limits constantly in order the reach a higher level, to become better in what they do.

Jimmy - Vocals (grudges)
Cliff - Vocals (Screams)

Bert Coessens - former EDA Guitar player but an eternal friend
