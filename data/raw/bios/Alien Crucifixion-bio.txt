Underground blackened death grind from Roswell, New Mexico.  They released a track on the Drum Machine Madness compilation (w/ Pilgrim Fetus, Agoraphobic Nosebleed, and Nemo) and one full-length CD, Relics Of A Dark Star.  The album was recorded in 2001 and never released.  However, pirated versions appeared on the internet.  The band disappeared until resurfacing in 2006 on Myspace, claiming to have been abducted for the last 5 years.
