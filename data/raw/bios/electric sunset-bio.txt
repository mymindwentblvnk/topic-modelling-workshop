Electric Sunset is the new group of Nic Zwart, formerly guitarist and vocalist of Desolation Wilderness. With Rock & Roll swagger applied to synthetic rhythms and ringing keyboards, Nic wanted to create music that was both propulsive and dream-like. Fitting that Electric Sunset took shape as he moved from Olympia back to San Francisco, the city where he was born - that crazy and beautiful metropolis of weirdos, models and rockers. Electric Sunset's debut self-titled album was released by K Records on the 14th September 2010.
