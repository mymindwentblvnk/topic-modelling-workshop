It all started 2005. Dark Possession was created. First of all, the music Vargoth wanted to play was black metal with a lot influence of scandinavian culture, as well as the slavic to hail the black metal legends like Immortal, Darkthrone, Bathory... As time passed, the music was created. Agresive, violent and...with one word, BETTER. So he changed name to Bethroned. As the amount of time passed, Lord Vargoth's project was noticed, so he was connected with Folk Records from Russia, DemonMusic from Malaysia, and ultimately Azermedoth Records from Mexico. This band is a reflect of his inner self and the music is reflect of true himself. He now feels stronger then ever and will continue to raise and pass the torch of black metal <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bethroned">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
