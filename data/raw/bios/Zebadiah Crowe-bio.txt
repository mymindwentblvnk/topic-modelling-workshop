H.p. lovecraft and Edgar Alan Poe inspired black metal. 
"Straight from some inner circle of hell where machines are used as instruments of torture. the perfect accompaniment to this exceedingly dark music. This album exudes the same air of malevolence as Demoncy’s “Joined in Darkness”, but in my opinion it’s even better. To sum up, this is fucking magnificent music. It fits within the parameters of Black Metal, yet it manages to be highly original. No small feat."
