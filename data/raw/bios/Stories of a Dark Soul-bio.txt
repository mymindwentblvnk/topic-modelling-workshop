The project "Stories Of A Dark Soul" got founded by DCS in the year 2009.

Planed as first as a death metal project, it developed to a black metal project with folk and death metal influences.

DCS got inspired by the squalidness of todays society, Hate and Nature. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stories+of+a+dark+soul">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
