Samuel Barnes, also know as Red Hot Lover Tone, or simply 'Tone', is a New York based Hip Hop artist and producer (forming one-half of the Trackmasterz duo, along with Jean-Claude Olivier) from the early 1990's. Barnes first made his mark on the East Coast Hip Hop scene in 1992 which saw him release his self-titled debut album and feature on MC Serch's track 'Back to the Grill Again' along with Chubb Rock and Nas. Although the album was met with minor success, it was his second album that hit the underground harder in 1995 with production from Hip Hop pioneers such as Diamond D, Buckwild and Greg Nice with features from Hip Hop heavyweights like The Notorious B.I.G., M.O.P., Organized Konfusion and Big Daddy Kane, artists he has also produced for as a part of the Trackmasterz. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Lover+Tone">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
