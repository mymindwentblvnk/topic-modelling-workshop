Dali's Dilemma was a five-piece progressive metal band formed San Jose, California in 1994. The band has a reputation for delivering technically demanding, high-velocity prog metal. Legitimate comparisons include DREAM THEATER, ENCHANT, FATES WARNING and SHADOW GALLERY as well as the more classic rockers such as RUSH and DEEP PURPLE. The band consists of Matthew Bradley on vocals, Patrick Reyes on guitar and brother Steve Reyes on bass, Jeremy Colson on drums, and former ZERO HOUR keyboard player Matt Guillory.

Their sole album Manifesto For Futurism (1999) is a ten-piece set that features strong musicianship punctuated by gothic, neo-classical tinges in its guitar lines. Some have criticised the album for being overly derivative of DREAM THEATER but it does distinguish itself, both from a compositional and lyrical standpoint. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dali%27s+Dilemma">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
