Born in Athens, Georgia back in 2006, The Low Low's count one Parker L Noon, formerly of the often acclaimed but consistently ignored NYC experimental pop duo Parker And Lily, among its ranks. Taking the name from his former groups last ever release, Noon poured every ounce of the bitter heartbreak that hung heavy over the dissolution of not only his group but also his long term relationship with life partner Lily Wolfe into The Low Low's.

The resulting sound calls to mind the shoe-gazing narcotic sounds crafted by the likes of Mazzy Star, and Slowdive nestled with the indie-country acts such as Sparklehorse and My Morning Jacket. This is the sound of someone unafraid to evoke tender heartbreak without putting up the brave front. Guitars slide, drone and fumble, organs slowly oscillate and wheeze to fade and drums patter away filling in the wide-open spaces, all while the eerie, ghostly falsetto vocals soar and trail to create a thing of true frazzled beauty, it's skin bruised and blushed in equal measure. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Low+Lows">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
