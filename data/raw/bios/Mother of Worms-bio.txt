MOTHER OF WORMS unholy squad was spewed forth from the pits of hell at the end of 2007.  Three fanatical followers of Satan stuck in drunkenness, violence and debauchery - Teeraahl, Sekthaarian and Akkerhond  -  were chosen by darkness to pest the world with evil and hatred.  After recording two demo-tapes which spread exceptionally among the friends of wicked trinity, the band began recording  the first true album, but... On August, 18, 2008 Hell called one of the apostles back... Akkerhond died of heart-failure. 
Only a few months after Akkerhond’s death two remaining participants found worthy replacement of their comrade gone to Darkness. Stryggha - satanist, psychopath and Black Metal maniaс took office of the new messenger of the Devil. Stryggha  was ready to do anything to bring the world end closer. In April 2009 MOTHER OF WORMS  finally recorded its  the debut album "The Dirty Arts". "The Dirty Arts" contains 10 nightly hymns of urbanistic madness in the Morbid Metal style with dark ambient addition, saturated with perversity and ancient Darkness.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mother+Of+Worms">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
