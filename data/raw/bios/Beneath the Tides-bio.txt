BIO
Beneath The Tides formed in Mid 2011 in the Australian capital, Canberra. Chris (bassist) who is the only member from Canberra, Heath (vocalist) from Merimbula NSW, Sean (guitar) from Perth WA, Tony (drums) from Delegate NSW and Adrian (guitar) from Sydney NSW. 

With the members coming from all parts of Australia and all with different musical backgrounds all with varied influences from the old school metal of Pantera, Metallica and Slayer to the new school metal of As I Lay Dying, Caliban, Trivium and Lamb Of God you can expect a brutal combination of heavy tech riffs, massive breakdowns, Randy Blythe styled vocals and all round tight technical metal you are sure to find something to mosh, headbang to or just like the style of metal they throw out there.
Once the band had a set list down and were happy with the sound, they booked their first gig on the 18th of February with State of Integrity, Sodomiser, Lab 64, Samantha Hera and Foundry Road. They put on one hell of a first show and showed the Canberra what they are all about.
Beneath The Tides are quickly becoming a well known name in the Metal scene.
After playing over a dozen gigs with many great Australian and International bands including Mnemic, Dawn Heist,Frankenbok and Deprivation to name a few. Beneath The Tides have finally hit the studio to record their Debut Album "A New Beginning", to be released early 2013. The album is produced by Marc Gortz of the internationally acclaimed metal artists Caliban, following the release will see Beneath The Tides take to the road for their Australian Album launch tour stretching the entire east coast. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beneath+the+Tides">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
