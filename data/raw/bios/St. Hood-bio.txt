St. Hood is a tight five piece unit delivering heavy hardcore with hard riffs and pounding rhythms. Formed in late 2003 in Lahti, Finland and containing members from such classic Lahti hardcore acts as Morning After, 7th Legion and Pitfiend, St. Hood has gained a reputation of being a hard and energetic live band. With only having released one sold out 4-song demo in early 2004, St. Hood has already played numerous shows in Finland, Sweden, Germany, Netherlands and Belgium. The unique fearsome mixture of heavy metal and hardcore with hard groove, and hard vocals with dark but truthful personal lyrics is the St. Hood trademark that has been praised a lot in many international websites, e-zines and radio shows. With everything based on the friendship and good spirit of this dream team - the tight musicianship, the true emotions, the fun of making music, the dedication, the determination and the hunger can be heard in every note. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/St.+Hood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
