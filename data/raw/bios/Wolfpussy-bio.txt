WolfPussy are a Hard Rock/Stoner Metal band from Portland, Oregon, USA, formed as an attempt appease the voices of the gods so prevalent in the minds of its members, torture , torment, and all out rage being fed to them by the complacency of their genre.
In all seriousness Wolfpussy is a breath of fresh air in a genre full of doom, taking much inspiration from 70's rock,metal, bands like Thin Lizzy, Black Sabbath, vanilla fudge, Blue Cheer, Lord Baltimore,Iron Maiden,etc. They look to bring a new perspective to an already growing genre.
They're live show translates the energy their music generates, one listen to the explosive drums , melodic guitars ,or thundering bass will let you know they want you to feel the energy they dump into the soul of this band.
Members: Jason Sloan, Zach White , Dominick McIntosh, Kene MacPherson
