Borrowing from the wispy sounds of vintage Sarah Records and Flying Nun artists, Brooklyn, New York’s Ex Cops is the project of Brian Harding (ex-Hymns) and and Amalie Bruun (ex-Minks).
Formed in 2011 the duo self-released a short-run, homespun CD-EP of hazy, lo-fi recordings featuring Harding’s opaque bedroom-pop songwriting juxtaposed with the duo’s sun-kissed harmonies. Their John Siket-produced (Yo La Tengo, Sonic Youth) debut, True Hallucinations, was released on Other Music Recording Co.

In 2014, they returned with their sophomore studio album, Daggers.
