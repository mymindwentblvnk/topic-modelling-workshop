Formless is a Technical Death Metal band from Connecticut.  Founded in 2009, it was initially a semi-serious side project of members Kevin (vocals, programming) and Ken (guitar, bass).  With the addition of Annie (guitar) later that year, the band became a serious entity.  Work was started on the first official demo, which was released in the Fall of 2010, and is available for free download from the band's official BandCamp page: http://formless.bandcamp.com/album/2010-demo.

Summer 2010 saw the addition of Craig and Kyle (bass and drums, respectively), completing the band's line-up. Immediately after the release of the demo, work was begun on a full-length debut. In October of 2011, after somewhat of an unannounced hiatus, the band released the single "To Vindicate False Witness" as a free digital download on through their BandCamp account. In the summer of 2012, the band began recording for their debut full-length and also announced Jake as their new drummer.
