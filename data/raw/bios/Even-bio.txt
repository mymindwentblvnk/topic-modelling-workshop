Even are an Australian indie rock three-piece fronted by singer/songwriter/guitarist Ashley Naylor, with Matthew Cotter on drums and Wally Kempton (also known as Wally Meanie) on bass and backing vocals. Even formed in Melbourne, Australia in March 1994.

History 

Naylor and Cotter played music together at high school and in indie band The Swarm, before being joined by Kempton on bass . Even played their first gig in 1994 at the Empress of India Hotel in Fitzroy, Victoria and after a number of EP's, the band released their first studio album, "Less is More" in 1996. 

From 1996-2004, Even were signed to Rubber Records, home to other Melbourne bands such as The Casanovas, Offcuts and 1200 Techniques. 

They released their album "Free Kicks" on an independent label in 2004.

Kempton is also the bass player for Melbourne punk outfit The Meanies, and organised the 2005 Hoodoo Gurus tribute album 'Stoneage Cameos'. 

Naylor has always been a fan of 1960s and '70s pop music, with the band's 1997 release "Come Again" being described by You Am I frontman Tim Rogers as his "favourite The Beatles album.".  In 1999, he teamed up with Sherry Rich to form the The Grapes for a one-off, self-titled album.

During their career, Even have supported artists such as, Placebo, The Dandy Warhols, Dinosaur Jr, Buffalo Tom and Urge Overkill among others. They have also travelled outside of Australia, notably in 2002 when they recorded part of "Free Kicks" in London. This album featured a guest appearance by Ian McLagan, former keyboardist with The Small Faces/The Faces. Even played shows with Cake,Joe Strummer,The Dandy Warhols, as well as playing at the Fierce Festival.
