Aggressivity from Stam1na and harmonies from Dream Theater, mixed with twisted pop-melodies and mindflowing arrangements in the footsteps of the crazy canadian metal-professor Devin Townsend. Those are the ingredients for duck metal, the unique music that is brought to you by the Board of Aves.

Board of Aves hails from Palokka, Finland and has been around since 2001 when three lazy mates Elias, Jaakko and Aleksi, all bored with sports, decided to form up a band. Not to anyone's surprise they started out by playing Metallica and Children of Bodom in their parents' garages. For the first 8 years they went by the name Afubad, until decided to go for something (a little) less stupid in late 2009.

The lineup has not changed since 2003 when Jani joined the group, but it took all in all six years to record their first demo 'Death Medicine EP' which was released in 2007. The second demo 'Settled Mind EP' was released a year after and they both claimed great reviews and positive feedback. After the second demo the band played just a few shows in 2009 before going on a six-month public hiatus to write better songs and rehearse a lot. 

January 11th of 2010 saw Board of Aves releasing their latest effort, the self-titled Board of Aves EP, as a free download (you can find it here) to the public. A CD version was also made available.
