About
Arkodaemik originated and transformed from a previous 3 piece band based out of northern Alberta in the late 1990s. The band at that time went under the names Black Abyss and Fallen. No formal recording was ever done at that time other than rehearsals put to tape. That version of the band did eventually come to an end but the recordings, and more specifically the songs created seemed to have lived on.

Taking influences from some of the earlier black metal bands such as Burzum, Dark Funeral, Mayhem, and others, the sound is rooted in what could be called old school black metal. The true raw feeling created back in those days cannot be recreated ever again, but this release will at least serve as a recording that pays tribute to those times, and brings the music into a different decade.

The updated recordings, and additional new material, were recorded in 2009 and 2010 by one of the original members of the old bandâ€¦ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arkodaemik">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
