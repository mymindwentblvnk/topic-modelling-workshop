Odz Manouk is/was a one-man black metal project formed in 2005 and hailing from Long Beach, California. Although it has been implied that other members were involved at some point, the band is spearheaded by Yagian (also one of the two owners/musicians of Rhinocervs, and a former member of the defunct projects Nihilobstat and Ashdautas) and he is currently the only member. 

In Armenian mythology, "Odz-Manouk" was the son of a nameless king and queen who was born as a serpent. Rejecting any other food, he was fed virgin maidens and kept in a secluded chamber beneath the king's castle. One day, a young woman named Arevhat was captured as a meal for Odz Manouk. When the king entered his monstrous son's chamber, he found that Arevhat was still alive and that his son had turned into a beautiful young man. Odz Manouk and Arevhat then succeeded the king and queen as rulers of Armenia.
