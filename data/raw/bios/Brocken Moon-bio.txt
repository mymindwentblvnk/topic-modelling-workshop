Brocken Moon is a black metal band from Karlsruhe, Germany, formed in 1999. It is thought that the band name comes from Brocken, the highest peak in the Harz mountain range in northern Germany . Their first two demo's are rough 'rehearsal' recordings as they both contain one long track. The other three demo's form their debut album  Mondfinsternis. In 2009 a compilation album was released, containing two CD's. CD 1 contains demo 3 till 5 and CD 2 contains demo 1 and 2 and a new song called "Die Leere".
