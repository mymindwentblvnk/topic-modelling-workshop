Vyron is 19 years old and started mixing since 2007. He became very obsessed with the whole dubstep thing, it had an unique tempo and energy, which became very addictive. 

Early 2009 he started producing on FL9 to sort out his own music, mostly in collaboration with his good friend Matar. Vyron is also part of the Artificial VZW Crew which are the masterminds behind the leading event called Bassix. 

At the end of 2009 Vyron gets signed by Dubline Audio for the collab tune he made together with Devnik called World Of Fear and his own tune called Colonial Settlers which will be released on vinyl in 2010. Now Vyron keeps on producing, creating sick beats hoping to get his tunes on the biggest labels. His tunes are supported by DJ's such as Total Recall, Fused Forces, Bukez Finezt, Itchy Robot, Devnik, Eptic and lots more

Vyron played on events next to Stenchman, Sukh Knight, Kryptic Minds, Kutz, Scandalous Unltd, Eptic, Limewax, Proxima, DJ Vapour, June Miller, Saviour, Crossfire, Science and many more.. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vyron">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
