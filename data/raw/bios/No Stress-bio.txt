No Stress is a band that was created in 1998. The first members were Big D, King Sult and Arnaud aka Stretch. Their acts mainly consisted of RnB covers and choreographies. Stretch left the band in 1999 to start some solo songs. A few months later, Marty (aka Snike) joined the band. Snike added a new dimension to the band thanks to the production of the first song: Back in Town.
After a while Snike received a once in a lifetime opportunity being the possibility to produce his own songs. He then left the band to concentrate on his solo career.
The band took a new direction when Douds joined the band. Sultan met him at the University where Douds let him hear his demo album. Sultan was really impressed by the skills and asked him to join the project. Douds 's smooh voice combined with his excellent writing skills helped the band release in 2001 their first slow single: Tell Me. 
The band split in 2002 but was kept alive by King Sult and Mic. They are still regularly singing around Belgium. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/No+Stress">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
