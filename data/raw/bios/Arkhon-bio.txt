Arkhon was formed in Winter 2003 after a series of attempts,being one of the first extreme metal bands in the island of Cyprus,to emerge from the new generation of metalheads. Started of as a four-piece act but now moved to a standart five piece band,having a session-bassist for lives,the band is now able to deliver better on stage the complexity and emotion of certain songs.With a good number of gigs and concerts that have supported two major greek metal bands, Arkhon continue unstoppable to spread death/thrash with discortant melodies and vain demon poetry. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arkhon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
