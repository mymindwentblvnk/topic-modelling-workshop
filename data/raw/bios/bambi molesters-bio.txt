The Bambi Molesters is a surf rock band from Sisak, Croatia. Since their formation in 1995 they have taken part in the revival of the 1960s surf genre and continue to contribute to its survival and further development with their music.

The Bambi Molesters perform regularly in Croatia and all over Europe, often opening for the US rock band R.E.M..

They have managed to build their reputation as a contemporary surf rock band. They differ from other surf rock revival bands in that their music is a continuation of vintage surf music.

After many years of anticipation, The Bambi Molesters, have announced, on their official website, the release of a new album expected out sometime in November of 2009. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Bambi+Molesters">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
