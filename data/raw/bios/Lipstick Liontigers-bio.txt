Lipstick Liontigers was formed in the early 80's by Screamin' Eagle and Speedking. After becoming world-superstars in 85 with the top billboard-single Rock me like a thunderstorm, they have both recruited and fired a bunch of musicians. Eventhough, the band is today known as being true like iron, and also surviving shit-ass trends like DJ's, pop and techno. It has been said that this band is capable of destroying a planet, but also making a tornado fall in love.

The current line-up is as follows: 
Screamin' Eagle: vocals
Speedking: lead guitar
Alph Thunderstorm: keyboards
Bear Thor: rhythm guitar
Shreddie Flexxx: bass guitar
Gary The Barbarian: drums <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lipstick+Liontigers">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
