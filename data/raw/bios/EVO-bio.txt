(1) Evo (Silvana Noris) Italian and german origins, based in Italy, was mainly a Italo-Disco performer who merged her experience in martial arts with music. Silvana Noris was tragically overlooked back in her mid 80s heyday, laying down just three singles before drifting into writing and publishing books. She was mostly known for her Italo Disco Boogie Funk Single "Din Don" in 1983.

(2) May 12, 2009 formed EVO, which began play in the already beloved by many connoisseurs of genres «Trancecore», «Nintendocore», «Electronic Post-Hardcore». During this time the group has seen many significant changes and, after a short break, the group came to life again with new musicians and extreme vocals. Thought leader and vocalist net remains the same - Mad Dee.
