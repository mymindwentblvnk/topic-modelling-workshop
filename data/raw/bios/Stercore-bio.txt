Stercore is a death metal/deathcore/grindcore band from Slovakia that formed in 2012. After only 3 months they released their first demo entitled "Raven Nest". In the fall of 2012 they added a second guitarist Peter K. In 2013 they released an LP "Fake World" under the label Rest Of Noise Productions. In 2014 (under the same label) they released a 4-track album called "Suffer". In 2015 they released a promo called "Die Without Sins" while working on new material. They also toured, playing at festival and gigs in middle Europe during the same time.

Within 5 years they have supported bands such as: Afgrund, Mumakil, Exhumed, Holocausto Cannibal, Benighted, Brujeria, Soulfly, PWD, My Autumn, along with many others. Around 2017 two new band members were added (bass and drums) to help work on a new album. The new album (EP) is titled: "Eternal Sunlight" and was released under Slovak Metal Army label. This EP came out in 2017.
