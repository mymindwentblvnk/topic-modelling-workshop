Left To Vanish's sound builds upon their rich Philadelphia heritage and sets out to expand upon the current extreme metal and hardcore sounds of today to create intricate, groove oriented brutality. Being around for four years now, Left to Vanish has gone through many hardships and line up changes but has remained extremely focused and definitely gelled to form the powerhouse that they are today. Consisting of Keith Nolan (vocals), Sean Salm (guitars), Kevin Salm (guitars), Paul Meredith (drums) and Bryan Little (bass), Left To Vanish are highly determined and set to destroy.
