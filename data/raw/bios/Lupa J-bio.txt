Since 17-year-old Sydneysider Lupa J (neé Imogen Jones) made the transition from classically trained violinist to contemporary electronic producer & songwriter at the age of 15; the development of her unique, alluring style of blending synthesised instrumentation with violin has captured the attention of taste-making music media the world over, including Australia’s triple j radio who named her a finalist in last year’s national Unearthed High competition.

Now completing her final year of school at Sydney’s selective Conservatorium High (past alumni includes The Presets and some of Australia's most acclaimed classical talents) Lupa J has delivered ‘Quiet Here’, a beguiling slice of left-of-centre pop that serves to further demonstrate her prowess at fusing organic instrumentation with tasteful electronic production, not to speak of her enchanting vocal ability and lyrical flair that suggests soulfulness well beyond her years.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lupa+J">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
