Smooth McGroove is the stage name of Max Gleason, a YouTuber known for recording a cappella versions of video game music. His videos feature multiple videos of himself, with long hair and beard, recording each part, often complemented by a video of the relevant game being played. His cat, Charl, often appears with him in the videos.

He has recorded music from many popular video game series, including Zelda, Final Fantasy and Mega Man. His videos have garnered millions of views, and he has left his job giving private music lessons to focus fully on his a cappella videos. When asked about working with more modern tracks, he sided against it, stating that "music for video games today serve a more atmospheric role with less of a focus on memorable melodies", but noting the Elder Scrolls series as an exception. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Smooth+McGroove">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
