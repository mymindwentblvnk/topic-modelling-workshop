There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Since forming in 1993, MAHATMA have strived constantly to develop and hone their own style. Pursuing their powerful and heavy sound, they are securing their place as one of Korea’s true metal bands. They have proven their worth in the underground playing shows with their musical ability and stage presence. While pursuing their original brand of heavy metal, MAHATMA strive to be an uncompromising musical force. Through many live shows, they have shown their audiences their conviction; they consider metal to be their single, everlasting inspiration.

2) MAHATMA is a result of a conjuction between the two croatian bands KRUGEL and SCHUBER back in the year 2000 in Zabok/V. Trgovisce.

The band immediately started to work on their first album that was finished exactly one year after the birth of MAHATMA, and was named "Motorpeople". The album was comprised of several songs that were already existant on KRUGEL's demo "Adrenalin" and some never before recorded SCHUBER songs. A couple of years and numerous live performances later, MAHATMA put together an EP named "format c:" which also included three videos from their live performance on VTV. 

The most recent release involving MAHATMA is a compilation "New Underground: Hard Hitters From Croatia", released by Dallas Records which includes "Visitor" and "Let Life" from "format c:" EP.
