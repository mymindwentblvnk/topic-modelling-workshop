This man is an early pioneer of fusing traditional heavy metal and rap. The rumor mill says that Megaforce founder Jon Z went under the pseudonym Lone Rager and he's backed by members of the The Rods along with Andy "Duck" McDonald (Blue Cheer, The Rods, KSB, Thrasher, Playground, Shakin' Street, Bible Black, Avigal).  Lone Rager released only one single called  Metal Rap. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lone+Rager">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
