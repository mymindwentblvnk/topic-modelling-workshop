Abortion is a Slovakian grindcore / mincecore band, whom have become quite well-known within the European grindcore underground. They began in 1989, under name Face of Death (or known F.O.D.), and then in 1990 switched to the named Abortion. After few demo tapes, Abortion released their debut CD "Murdered Culture" in 1998. In the following year, a split with Belgian mincecore legends Agathocles was released, titled "We Never Forget". Original guitarist Picass eventually left the band, but was soon replaced by new guitarist, Chipso. Abortion are still active, and continue to release more 7 inches and full-lengths under various labels throughout the world - and are currently on the Czech label Obscene Productions.
