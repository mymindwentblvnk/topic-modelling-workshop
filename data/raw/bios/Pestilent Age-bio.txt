If old school death metal butt fucked melodic death metal and had a retarded child who engaged in a bit of incest with thrash metal the resulting abortion might sound similar to Pestilent Age. Fueled by coffee, cigarettes, a constant lack of sleep, and an extreme hatred for pop culture Pestilent Age has been not giving a fuck about your opinion since April of 2016. If cleanly sung choruses are your thing then look elsewhere. Pestilent Age is sonic wall of guttural vocals in front of down tuned guitars chugging out palm muted chords underneath an array of blazing fast leads. The rumble of gravely bass and double kick hit below the belt while the crack of Steveâ€™s snare will smack you straight in the face.
