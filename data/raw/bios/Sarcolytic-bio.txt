Sarcolytic was forged in 2003, when Images Of Violence, of Austin, Texas decided to form a side project with Images roadie and friend, Tim Smith. Steven Watkins, Mark Denton, and Jon Zig began writing material. This did not get very far, Tim had to move away for personal reasons, therefore leaving a huge gap in the place of where a drummer once throned. Shows with I.O.V. and some other sick bands in California were not played on the account of internal conflicts within the band. Because time has been set aside to travel, Steven and Zig decided to go to California on their own to see friends and have a good time. Previously, Steven and Zig had mentioned the backbone situation to good friend, Ricky Myers of Disgorge, and he wanted to hear what riffs Steven had. They jammed and Ricky wanted in. Absolutely. Ricky flew down to Austin shortly after and spent a week at Audio House, owned by engineer and shirt printer, Bill Dawson. 4 songs written,3 recorded. Mixed by Bryan at Gorilla Audio here in Austin. Ricky flew out a few more times to write and record 2 songs for a split cd on Ossuary Industries titled "Limb Splitter", along with Godless Truth, Devourment, and Sect Of Execration (Steven Watkins and Dobber, I.O.V.'S present drummer) released 2006. Ricky has since moved to Austin and writing of material is coming along quite gross. His band Disgorge is still head strong masters of their field, and intend on staying that way for years to come. Balancing it all takes brains and skill, and they are chopped full of that. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sarcolytic">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
