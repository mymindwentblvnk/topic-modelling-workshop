Mannfall is the solo black metal project started in 2008 by Count Corona Australis.

The name of the band roughly translates to 'slaughter' in old Norse. The vision for the music to create traditional raw, hateful and obscure black metal. The words are inspired by that of nature, pagan folklore and general contempt for humanity.

The sound of the music contains musical elements from many different Influences. To be specific you might say its crossed with countess and the works of the LLN (The Black Legions) of France.

Mannfall also belongs to the online black metal syndicate known as The Order of the Silver Night. The syndicate consists of bands such as: Fel, Tomes, Wiccademous, In Cripta, Atomic Tide and Morte Lune.



Mannfall currently has two releases, both available for download from the bands myspace:
