Angelblood was formed in the year 2000. Angelblood is Lizzi Bougatsos (vocals), Rita Ackermann (vocals), Brian DeGraw (bass), Dave Nuss (drums) and Anders Nilssen (guitar). In addition to being a band, Angelblood is also a performance art group, whose dark motifs and ritualized actions match the concerns of the band. Finally, Angelblood also creates collaborative art works, distinguished by a combination of distinctive drawing and edgy collage.
In all of its various incarnations, Angelblood is characterized by a raw, almost desperate approach to art and life, realms which, in the Angleblood ethos, are indistinguishable. It is this rebellious attitude of refusal and iconoclasm, coupled incongruously, yet sincerely, with a sense of pathos and reverence, that sets Angleblood apart from the monotonous drone of monolithic culture. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Angelblood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
