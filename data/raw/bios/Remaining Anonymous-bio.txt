Made from equal parts Rock, Metal and Funk; Remaining Anonymous from Longview, Texas has been slaying faces in the East Texas area since 2009. By some high encounter at a tripped out pizza joint that sold 50 cent beers (not the rapper, the actual currency), the three optomistic musicians came together an open mic night. Under the influence of Tool, Primus, King Crimson, and Faith No More they created a unique style and blend of music. Its without saying that its hard for a Rock/Metal band to make a name for themselves in the country music driven depths of East Texas, however Remaining Anonymous have proven  than even in a podunk place like East Texas real music can rise from the shadows of ignorance. 

The debut full length album From Remaining Anonymous, Drugs to do songs to; is a collection of songs that not only touches on the chemical substances themselves but the theory that anything can be a drug. Power, love, control, and greed all have their ill effect on the human psyche and in turn can be considered just as harmful as any chemical substance consumed.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Remaining+Anonymous">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
