Say what you want, the system is set up for people like us to fail. I do not give a shit what you call us. Middle class, Under class, Low class, No class. We will still be screaming in your face everyday. We are everything in life you choose to ignore. The kind of guys you love to hate, but could never be. Formed in Philly in late 96, when Derek came across drummer Ruben Yanez. I was just kickin it when I saw this little Mexican guy destroy his kit. I bought his ass a drink and we talked for a bit. He was not crazy about the music he was playing and we talked about what each of us wanted. Dark heavy music with melody. First thing he said was " Do not waste my time". I new he was the guy. He quit his band on the spot and we have been playing music ever since. The search for a bass player has not been so easy. Lots of damaged people out there. We decided to record with both of us doing the bass chores. Our first album , My Little Prayer Closet, was picked up by Nuclear Blast Records. When that deal did not live up to expectations we headed west to Rubens hometown Tucson, Az. After several attempts to secure a bass player, and a few years on the Tucson-Phoenix scene, we found Omar. Just like Ruben he said, Do not waste my time. Omar was in before he new it. Now after all this time, and proper Label interest, things are the way they should be. Three nasty, slimey guys from the street, with nothing left to lose, making killer music. As the band says, "take a look at the world around you. Thatâ€™s our music. Its all dark. We are what you refuse to see. Even if no one listened, we would still be a band". Flesh Factor has opened for George Lynch/Lynch Mob Steven Adler from Guns and Roses,Sacred Reich,2 shows with Death Angel and Tesla and Scorpions.
