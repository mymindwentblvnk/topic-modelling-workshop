The Langley Schools Music Project is a collection of children's chorus recordings made from 1976-77 by Canadian music teacher Hans Fenger in a school gymnasium in Langley, British Columbia, near Vancouver. The students beautifully performed pop hits by the likes of The Beach Boys, David Bowie, and Paul McCartney. The recordings were quickly forgotten until author, radio DJ, and "outsider music" enthusiast Irwin Chusid rediscovered them in 2000. He managed to get them released on Bar/None Records, and they immediately created an international buzz, making many end-of-the-year best album lists in 2001. VH-1 orchestrated a reunion of the students and their teacher in 2002, and aired a documentary as well. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Langley+Schools+Music+Project">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
