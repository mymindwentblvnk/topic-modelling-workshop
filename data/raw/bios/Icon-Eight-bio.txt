After having worked and played with many bands, projects and lazy people within different genres in the metal community in Bergen, M. "Mactabilis" Wilson was fed up. 

He was tired of boring black metal cellar bands trying to create the true feeling from the early nineties. Something had to be done. Thrash metal was the solution… 

Early January 2006 Mactabilis decided to start a new band and create a killer Ep. The idea was that it would be easier to write and record the songs for a debut release before searching for qualified musicians, which would make the bands vision crystal clear from the very beginning. Soon four songs were written and ready to be recorded.

Icon-Eight plays thrash metal inspired by the 80’s, but with attitude, power and quality that fits present time.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Icon-Eight">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
