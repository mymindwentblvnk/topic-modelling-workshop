220 KID is a producer/writer/DJ and artist from the UK. The 220 KID name was born after running 220 miles in bright pink pants for charity, after his beloved Godfather passed away. And after running that 220 miles he knew anything was possible. He was soon scouted as a model and has worked for the likes of Vogue, GQ, Nike, Reebok and many more, whilst continuing to develop and perfect himself as an established writer/producer.  Unquestionably 220 KID has a wide range of production skills, from epic string work to dirty house base lines. His infectious personality has also proven to be a hit within the music industry and fellow musicians. Alongside his fresh style of lyrical writing, he truly has the ability to make any pop song that little bit more ‘cool’. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/220+KID">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
