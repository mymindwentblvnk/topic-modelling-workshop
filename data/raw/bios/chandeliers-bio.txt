There are three artists with this name.

1) Chandeliers is a three-piece from Allston, MA. 

2) Chandeliers are a Chicago-based quartet that represent a phenomenon of unclassifiable modern music. Comprised of multi-instrumentalists from Chicago's blossoming young avant-rock scene, they have created a unique, and live, electronic sound. Adopting the collective spirit of krautrock bands like Can and Faust, the Chandeliers function as a unified whole, with no dominant members. This approach gives the band a more intuitive and unpredictable approach to composing.

Chandeliers bring the energy of a super-live party to their cerebral synth interplay.  An obvious reference is Kraftwerk, but with influences ranging from Burmese and Arabic melody, to the sonically dirty rhythmic propulsion of Konono no.1, and the crunked-out psychedelic hip-hop of J-Dilla, Chandeliers always keep the listener on their toes.  

The band is comprised of Chris Kalis, Dan Jugle, Harry Brenner, and Scott McGaughey, who collectively are also active members of Chicago groups Bronze, Michael Columbia, Icy Demons, Mandate, and Killer Whales.
