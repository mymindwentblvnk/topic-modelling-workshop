Formed in 2009, A VERY OLD GHOST BEHIND THE FARM is based on a visceral desire to break down barriers between doom, sludge, blackened metal, stoner and crust. You will find in this mass grave the scattered remains of a moribund Black Sabbath, some putrefying limbs of Acid Bath and the emaciated corpse of Khanate violating the consanguineous carcasses of Eyehategod and Crowbar.

Sometimes shall you hear the voices of very ancient ghosts.
Sometimes shall you feel the touch of some diabolic spell.
Sometimes shall you behold what hides behind the farm. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Very+Old+Ghost+Behind+the+Farm">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
