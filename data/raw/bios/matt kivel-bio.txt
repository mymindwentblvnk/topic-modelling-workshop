You might know Los Angeles singer-songwriter Matt Kivel from Princeton, or from his previous acoustic gem, Double Exposure. His artistic style is defined by his relaxed approach - Days of Being Wild was recorded over the course of six weeks in the summer of 2013, with friends and whiskey, in a small detached shed in Los Angeles. "Open Road" is an effortless two and a half minutes with an unwavering drumbeat, and delicate harmonies. The track packs a bit more of a punch compared to the rest of the album's contemplative nature with vocals that are uplifting and tender, especially when backed by both Jeremy Earl and Jarvis Taveniere (of Woods); perfect for summertime and especially open roads.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Matt+Kivel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
