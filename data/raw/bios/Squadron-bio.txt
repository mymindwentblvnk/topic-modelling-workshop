There are four artists called "Squadron".

The first is a power metal from the United States of America. Formed in 1981, Squadron released two albums entitled "First Mission" and "Fatal Strike." Now split-up, the band consisted of Steve Crandall (lead vocals), Brian Cassidy (guitars), Brent Sullivan (bass), and Jim McKenna (drums).

The second one is a nationalist band from the UK who started as a streetpunk/oi band but soon altered to a heavy/thrash metal band. Arguably, themost popular songs are "Stand Proud," "Master Breed," and "I Can See The Fire". The status of the band is that they are now defunct.

The third one is a Death metal Band from Germany. The most popular songs are "Way of the Gunslinger" and "Serenade to a Friend". The German "Squadron" is in no way a racist, fascist or nationalist band and rejects any Right-Wing activities. The band are active. Official homepage: www.squadron.de.be
