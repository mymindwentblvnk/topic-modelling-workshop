Weedie Braimah descends from a long lineage of drummers and composers, which includes his mother, Ann Morris, a respected Jazz drummer, his father, Oscar Sulley Braimah, a world-renowned composer and master drummer, and great-uncle, Jazz drumming icon, Idris Muhammad. Braimah honed skills learned through study with greats including Mamady Keita, Famadou Konate, Abdoul Doumbia, and Sylvester Sun Shine Lee among others.  He excelled musically and became one of the leading exponents of the West African diasporic drum and dance world in his teenage years. For more than 25 years, Braimah has been a performer, teacher and preserver of African culture who continues to traverse new musical pathways. 

Braimah exemplifies tradition, evolution and soul as he brings his vision of building a reverence for folkloric West African music to life. His mission? To have the evolution of this folkloric music recognized as relevant, respected and as the essential root of Jazz, funk, fusion, global music, and hip hop. And for his style of Stretch Music to take its rightful place as one of the pillars of modern music rooted in the African percussion continuum he has spent his lifetime championing throughout the world. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Weedie+Braimah">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
