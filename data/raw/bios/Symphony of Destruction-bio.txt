Symphony of Destruction is a Dutch metal band which is established in Dedemsvaart (Overijssel).
The band was formed in 2007. With true metal machines Tom behind the drums and Bas on the bass guitar, Symphony of Destruction (SOD) has a strong basis for the band. Along with the striking guitar riffs of Michiel and Jord, SOD creates a powerful and brutal sound, live and on CD. Deadly screams and growls by Michiel and Bas and terrific guitar solo’s put a finish to band’s sound. In March 2007 they recorded their first EP called Dominate the World. It contains four songs from the very first beginning of the band.

In June 2007, SOD started to hit the stage. After their first performance on the Endless Mind festival in Dedemsvaart, many sound systems were tortured. In March 2008 the band was ready to hit the studio again. Three of SOD’s best songs were recorded at Frankie’s Recording Kitchen, a studio owned by producer and mixer Berthus Westerhuis (who is also known due to producing God Dethroned and One Bullet Left). You can hear all three songs above. After the recordings, many gigs followed. With a mixture of metalcore and melodic death metal SOD keeps surprising the audience. Melodic sounds and hitting rhythms charge the audience again and again until their power explodes in the well-known and feared pit and Wall of Death. You should definitely check them out!
