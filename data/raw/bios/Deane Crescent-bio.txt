Dubbed the Death-Grind Machine from Johannesburg, Deane Crescent is comprised of four of the most tenacious and musically bent characters to ever creatively copulate. Sharing a passion for heavy music the band was formed in mid 2007 with the intention to create extreme music and deliver an intense performance. The band is noted for their use of extreme vocals and fast pasted riffing and drumming style. Deane Crescent is known for taking a stand for extreme music in the underground scene, and has helped increase the recognition of guttural music in the South African music scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deane+Crescent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
