Serious Danger was a speed garage artist and record producer, born Richard Phillips.

First becoming prominent in 1997, he was quite popular in the London area. Signed to Fresh Records, his best known songs are "Deeper" (1997), "High Noon" (1998) and "Spin Spin Sugar". Ultimately he made little lasting impact, having only four weeks worth of presence on the UK Singles Chart. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Serious+Danger">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
