Artist Notes

The daily world exerts a great influence over the mind and occupies its attention most of the time. Our senses are directed towards the physical world and the mind follows. There are times when we disregard the outer world and journey into an inner world, a place without limitations. It is the source of our untainted individual expression. A place where imagination and creativity knows no boundaries, where revelations are discovered and everything becomes effortlessly free flowing.  All we have to do in order to be aware of the unaware is to be silent and listen. We all perceive and respond to music in different ways. Music is completely subjective, this is why it is important to select music that is well suited to your senses and not become a victim of mass commercial advertising and pop culture brain washing of what's cool or not cool. Be confident and develop your own selective taste, it is key towards a smarter, greater, unique you.
