Armonight's genre is not easy to catalogue. A mix between rock, gothic, metal and melodic music, which gets to people's heart.

Armonight were born in 2007 from the idea of Lara (guitar) to find a band to play her friend Fjord’s compositions. After various vicissitudes and line-up changes, Ricky (drums) and Sy (voice) join the crew. With this formation, the band starts to record the first full-length, “Suffering and Passion”. The first musical label interested in their work is Heart of Steel Records, which is gonna work for the world wide distribution of the album. 

The band with Sy at the microphone, Ricky at the drums and Lara and Fjord at the guitars, starts playing its music. The genre is a pop-rock with gothic influences of great impact. They organize some live shows around Italy and abroad, with great satisfaction of their fans, which encrease every day. Many shift-players join at the bass guitar, among them even Mirco, sound engineer of the band, and the k-boards (the main instrument for the band’s sound) get sampled. July 2010, during a tour in Wales (UK), Francesco (Frens), the bass player at that moment, decides to remain in the band, with great satisfaction both of the crew and himself. 

The last new entry, December 2010, is Alberto (Hokuto), a k-board player who, after having seen Armonight live for his first time, decides with enthusiasm to join them too. Ricky is forced to leave for health problems, and the band is now looking for a new drummer, that they find in September 2011 in Nicolas P. After a great "Passion on the Road" 10-days tour in the U.K. (August 2011), Armonight are back, ready to work hard on their second album, live performances and musical experiences.
