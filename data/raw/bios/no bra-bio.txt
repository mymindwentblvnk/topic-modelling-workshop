No Bra is an electronic avant-garde band based in East London England who combine industrial grooves with sinister Germanic folk. The band had an underground hit with the single "Munchausen" in 2005. The track "Doherfuckher" was used as part of the sound track to Bruce La Bruce's film Otto or up With Dead People.  In 2007, the Dutch Scapino Ballet based a ballet performance on No Bra's music which toured around Europe. Despite claiming to be "not gay," No Bra's Susanne was nominated as their gay icon by influential British post punk band The Raincoats and asked to perform with them at the gay icons exhibition at the national portrait gallery in London in 2009. No Bra also appears in the upcoming documentary about The Raincoats.  The musician's image has inspired several visual artists such as Christophe Chemin and Brian Kenny and photographer Wolfgang Tilmans. No Bra's debut single Munchausen was BBC Radio DJ Pete Tong's 'Eclectic Tune of 2005' and James Hyman's 'Tune of the Year 2005'  and was described as essentially the London art-school answer to "Losing My Edge"'s Williamsburg smack down. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/No+Bra">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
