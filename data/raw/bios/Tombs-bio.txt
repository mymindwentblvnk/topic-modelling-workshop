Tombs is an Blackened Sludge Metal band formed in Brooklyn, NY in January 2007. The band plays a combination of multiple metal styles, including black metal, sludge metal, and doom metal. Mike Hill has likened the group's sound to being more black metal inspired than sludge metal. He has named bands such as Neurosis, Swans, Joy Division, Darkthrone, Black Flag, Deathspell Omega, Leviathan, and Bauhaus, among others, as being influential to their sound.

Tombs started as a collaboration project consisting of former Anodyne frontman Mike Hill (guitar, vocals), bassist Dominic Seita (ex-Speedloader) and drummer Justin Ennis (ex-The Heuristic). Carson Daniel James joined as their new bassist from 2009 to 2012 when he was replaced by Ben Brand. Dan Howard played additional guitar in 2012. In 2013, Garett Bussanick joined as a full-time second guitarist. Andrew Hernandez II (ex-ASRA) was their drummer from 2009 until 2014, when he was replaced by Charlie Schmid. Bussanick also left the band in 2014 and Evan Void joined as a new guitarist. Fade Kainer joined the band in 2014 as their synthesizer player and backup vocalist.

Tombs have released three full-length albums: Winter Hours in 2009, Path of Totality in 2011, and Savage Gold in 2014, all through Relapse. Savage Gold was produced and recorded by Erik Rutan. It has been unanimously praised by music critics, with Dave Schalek of About.com calling it "their heaviest album to date." They also released a self-titled EP and a split EP with Planks in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In 2010 they released a compilation album Fear Is the Weapon, consisting of tracks from the aforementioned EPs and demos from their Winter Hours sessions. The CD release was limited to 1000 copies. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tombs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
