Aganice was a metal band from Chile that played a certain kind of violin-based folk metal with strong doom metal influences. Flutist Ivonne Delgado and bassist Marlenne Arismendi began the project with the goal to form a serious project playing melodic metal. After they went through a couple of unsuccessful line-up changes the band finally ended up with drummer Alejandro Moyano, guitarist Julio BÃ³rquez und violinist David Jara giving them the relatively unique sound they display on their musical output. They have released one full-length titled "The Idol Of Perversity" in 2002, available under http://www.archive.org/details/Aganice-TheIdolOfPerversity_364 for free download. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aganice">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
