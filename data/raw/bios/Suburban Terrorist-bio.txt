SUBURBAN TERRORIST is playing since of May 2001. They´re comming from Slovakia (BelUSA). They started play an old school hard core, in spring 2002  recorded their first demo and made 150 pieces on their own and send it to the underground. One year later they were back in studio for recording a second promo. It contains just two songs which sounds harder and more technical. Suburban Terrorist is leaving an old HC and it´s gonna be closer to death metal. After one year took the band a time out due to outgoing members to abroad. At the end of 2004 started again in changed formation. Stoty (guitar, vocals) found his own group and Bongo (bass) is definitely out. To2my (guitar, vocals) and Lubo (drums) are keeping Suburban Terrorist alive. They immediatly took a guitarist Rado from Affront and started play harder, sicker, faster to reach a level of madness. After couple months he left the band from personal reason. So they took a second one from Affront (Macej - giutar, vocals). A new power of pure aggressive death core metal began. 

In April 2007 SUBURBAN TERRORIST recorded the third promo called RESPECT - IGNORANCE -PROVOCATION. At this time they're working on a new stuff which will be more sick, more technical then previous but still with the death core spirit which will be release next year. In late 2007 came a new bass player Miso and so is the band complete again. In summer 2008 went out a split album RESPECT, IGNORANCE, PROVOCATION - COLLECTION OF BODY (P)ARTS with czech death metal band SEPSIS under GRODHAISN PRODUCTION.
