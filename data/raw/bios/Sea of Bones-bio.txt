Formed in New Haven, CT, United States in the year 2005 by three friends who had known each other for a long time. Their music is a dark, angry, contemplative mix of sound and emotion. “A dissonant psychedelic wall of sound”. They have drawn comparisons to Neurosis, Swans, Buried at Sea, Pelican and Mastodon.

"Sea of Bones' atmospheric sludge is even bleaker than Neurosis'. The only color is shades of black. Ultra-heavy riffs rumble below distant smears of feedback. The sound is super fuzzed out, with buried vocals and occasional textural breathers." - Cosmo Lee (Decibel Magazine)

"The sludge of the Melvins, the chaotic feedback of Floor, and epic-length songs that rise and fall in cascades of morose and furious angst --- capped off with brutal, evil vocals. Call it doom metal, call it stoner rock, call it whatever you want: New Haven, Connecticut’s Sea of Bones have raised the bar for any band that describes themselves as "heavy". Not for the casual listener, but ultimately rewarding for any hard music fan seeking something original, vast, and devastating." - Ross Parker (Verbicide Magazine)

"Sea Of Bones is a funeral doom band at heart; one that employs a very different aesthetic and sonic quality than most funeral doom bands, but still part of the style nonetheless. Imagine if one of those frequently lauded post-metal bands like Isis or Pelican played funeral doom; that's the sort of thing that Sea Of Bones does. So while the sound of the music here is perhaps slightly more accessible than the majority of funeral doom, this still has more in common with Tyranny than it does Red Sparowes." noktorn.wordpress.com
