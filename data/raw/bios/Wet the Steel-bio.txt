Wet The Steel's only goal is to instill pure unadulterated hatred into the minds of listeners. Stay tuned for "Awoken by the Bitter Stench of Reckoning," the debut album, coming soon... 

NOTE (coming directly from the guitarist): "Wet The Nintendo" was 100% a JOKE. It is not one of our songs, nor will it ever be included on a release. Please stop thinking we are a nintendocore/cybergrind band. Thank you. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wet+The+Steel">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
