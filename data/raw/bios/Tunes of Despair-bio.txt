Tunes of Despair are a black/doom metal band consisting of two founding members based in Finland and Hungary. Their main lyrical themes are about Death, melancholy, Darkness and Void, along with several undisclosed personal aspects and beliefs. Tunes of Despair's influences derive from the more sinister kind of black metal and funeral doom. The band was formed in the summer of 2010 by U.Morbid (Fornicatus, Photophobia, Unjoy & ex-Dead), handling all instruments and Vorst as vocalist.

Their first EP 'The Process of Leaving' was released in November 2010, the first full-length 'From Beyond the Vein' is scheduled to be released in September 2011.
