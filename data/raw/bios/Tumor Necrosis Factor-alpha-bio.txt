Death Metal Grindcore band from Qu√©bec, Canada
Scientists, academics, gorefiends and grindheads of the world rejoice: Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (henceforth referred to as TxNxFx-a) is getting ready to unleash it's subcellular grinding fury to the unsuspecting grind scene. This one-man band was formed in an actual research laboratory during the fall of 2010. Fusing a passion for both scientific research and old-school grindcore, TxNxFx-a offers its take on full blown Carcass-worshipping goregrind, chock full of insane riffing and old school blasting, topped with unique lyrical themes inspired by the most recent knowledge in state-of-the-art scientific research from the fields of cellular and molecular biology. Each song lyrics is backed up by extensive literature and timely references from the wolrd's top scientific journals. Bet'cha never tought apoptosis, DNA repair, retroviral infection or cell cycle regulation could be so gruesome!
