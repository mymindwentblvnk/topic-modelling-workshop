Burning Memories started in 2004, when the very first ideas, riffs, rehearsals started. After a long and windy road we are now ready to show our work to everyone out there through our EP available for listening @ last.fm. The band's themes are half way between nostalgic deep depression, sadness agony and rage. With hate and violence as an active answer.
Man's feelings are universal, and that is what this band explores. We explore the darkest side of the human mind and expose it. From melancholy (cause) to exlosive reaction (effect)...

Burning Memores lives again and again the day-to-day psychosis.
