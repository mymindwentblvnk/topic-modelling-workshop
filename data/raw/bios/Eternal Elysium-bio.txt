ETERNAL ELYSIUM is Heavy Rock band. We're deeply influenced by '70s Heavy Rock bands like BLACK SABBATH, LED ZEPPELIN, GRAND FUNK RAILROAD.... and also Doom Rock scene got us much vibrations. I (Yukito) was inspired by early '80s Doomstars, TROUBLE, SAINT VITUS, PENTAGRAM. Of course, Stoner Rock scene is so important for us.

These great music made the base-framework of EE's sound. I keep on putting out the heavy sound, but not just do that. I think maybe maniacs of EE know that our any other influences, those are Psychedelic, Blues, Funk, Noise... We don't wanna be typical Doom/Stoner band, so anytime we accept a lot of music styles.

Skills of my guitars are almost from '70s heavy rock guitarists. Especially, TOMMY BOLIN gave me so much great feelings.

"FAITHFUL" was totally heavy/doom metal album. I tried to close to classic '70s rock after that, and "SPIRITUALIZED D" has classic heavy rock feeling, doom/stoner riffs, and psychedelic textures. "SHARE" is mixtured between our sound until last album and Black music. One of song on that album "Waiting for the Sun" is our Doom Blues, "Movement and Vibes" is kind of joke (not bad mean, I like it) of Disco, and "Dogma" is under influenced by African music.

All we're interested in hunting something of great artists so much, so excellent arts never stop influence us the spring of creativity ever.
