Singer-songwriter and Detroit native Charlie Burg has grown up with music since the third grade, explaining his music's diverse influence—including Motown figures, Coldplay, Ella Fitzgerald, and more. He is known for his style incorporating R&B, soul, folk and indie rock and has furthered his studies in music at Syracuse University.

He has released Blue Wave Mosaic in 2015—his debut mixtape—before releasing Live in Peter's Attic, a four-song EP in 2016 including "I Don't Wanna Be Okay Without You"; and a three-part album (One, Violet; Two, Moonlight; and Three, Fever) from 2017–2019. Since then, he has released a handful of singles, planning to release more music in the coming year and continuing his collaborative project with Hard Car Kids. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Burg">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
