Producer No I.D. has started up a new collective of musicians, singers, and rappers who all call themselves Cocaine 80s. 

Well, there is actually only one rapper in the group, Common, and he appears on just one of the seven tracks on their EP, ''The Pursuit''. Otherwise, the focus here remains on the musicianship and soulful/R&B-leaning vocals of Steve Wyreman, Rob Kinelski, Kevin Randolph, James Fauntleroy, Makeba, Rod Smith, and others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cocaine+80s">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
