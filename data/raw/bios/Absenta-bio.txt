ABSENTA was born in Cordoba (Spain) on November, 2001. Originally formed by Agui (guitar) and Alkaudon (vocal), in 2002 was decided to include Blackangel (keyboard) to give a melodic aspect to the compositions.

With this members the band played in many gigs which could be highlighted Broken Head Fest On Tour (Córdoba, 04) and the final on the competition of Sala Malevaje (Almería, 04). In the same period was recorded the first demo THE THING AT THE DOORSTEP (2004). The good reviews for this work made possible to play on stages such as Sala Ritmo & Compás (Madrid, 05) and "Metal Lords" (Córdoba, 06) opposite to more than 500 people.

After two years of changes, in 2007, Velfortr (bass) and Bäel (guitar) joined to the band and the second work was recorded. BAETICUM was a miniCD well recogniced by international reviews. The most important gig in this period was the Valhalla Metal Festival (Córdoba, 08) which video is one of the most representative items of this Baeticum period.

Again the coming of two years of changes and the last incorporation for the band, Félix (drums), brought an productive period and many new themes were composed, so in 2010, the first complete CD have been recorded.
