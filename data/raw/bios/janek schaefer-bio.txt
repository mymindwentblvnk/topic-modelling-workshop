Janek was born in England to Polish and Canadian parents in 1970. While studying architecture at the Royal College of Art [RCA annual prize], he recorded the fragmented noises of a sound activated dictaphone travelling overnight through the Post Office. That work, titled 'Recorded Delivery' [1995] was made for the 'Self Storage' exhibition [Time Out critics choice] with one time postman Brian Eno and Artangel. 

Since then the multiple aspects of sound became his focus, resulting in many releases, installations, soundtracks for exhibitions, and concerts using his self built/invented record players with electroacoutisc collage. The 'Tri-phonic Turntable' [1997] is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the 'World's Most Versatile Record Player'. He has performed, lectured and exhibited widely throughout Europe [Sonar, Tate Modern, ICA], USA/Canada, [The Walker, XI, Mutek, Princeton], Japan, and Australia [Sydney Opera House].

The context of each idea is central to its development and resolution. His concerts and installations explore the spatial and architectural aspect that sound can evoke and the twisting of technology. Hybrid analogue and digital techniques are used to manipulate field recordings with live modified vinyl and found sound to create evocative and involving environments. 

His CD 'Above Buildings' [2000] was released on Fat Cat to considerable praise, [The Guardian CD of the week]. He plays in duos with Philip Jeck (Songs for Europe CD), Robert Hampson (Comae CD), and Stephan Mathieu (Hidden Name CD). 

Janek runs his own label "audiOh!Recordings" and web site audiOh.com as well as releasing work with Asphodel, Sub Rosa, Staalplaat, Hot Air, Sirr, Rhiz, Alluvial, DSP and Diskono. 

He currently works as a full time sound artist/sound designer/musician/visiting lecturer and composer from the audiOh! Room in London.
