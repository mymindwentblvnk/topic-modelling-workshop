French heavy metal combo Stonecast forms in Marseille by will of Franck and Cazu with the aim of exploiting previous musical experiences through a brand new project. The focus is on creating a personal and individual style, their own sonic dimension strong of identity and personality. Stonecast are hence ready for their debut album, “Inherited Hell” in 2009, and a deal with Italian label Underground Symphony.

After some line-up adjustment, the release of the album is being backed by a series of live shows during which Stonecast presents Inherited Hell in all its live power and impact. The peak of intensity is reached in 2011 when the band plays as the closing act of the “Big 4” day at the Sonisphere Festival France (METALLICA, MEGADETH, SLAYER, ANTHRAX). The following months are then being fully dedicated to the writing of the next record.

In late 2012 Stonecast returns to the studio, and their second offering is taking a dramatic turn of epic proportions as the legendary Kenny Earl “RHINO” (MANOWAR, Jack Starr’s BURNING STARR) join forces behind the drumkit of doom. Mixed and mastered by Mariusz Pietka (known from cooperation with CRYSTAL VIPER, SACRED STEEL, MORTICIAN) in early 2013, this antic piece of Heavy Metal unveiled on 11/12th by Cyprus famous Pitch Black Records, to the Daughters and Sons of Iron, Steel...HEAVY METAL !!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stonecast">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
