Odawas is a psychedelic/ambient rock band that formed in Bloomington, IN in late 2003. Their first EP, Vitamin City, was self-released in 2004. In 2005, Jagjaguwar Records released The Aether Eater, the band's first full-length. While recording a follow-up record, singer and songwriter Michael Tapscott produced a home-recorded solo record under the moniker More Animals of the Arctic. An Appendix of Whaling Terms was released in 2006 by Standard Recording Company. 2007 saw the release of Raven and the White Night on Jagjaguwar. The album found the band crafting material that blended the songwriting of Tapscott's solo work and the ambient textures developed on Odawas' Jagjaguwar debut. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Odawas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
