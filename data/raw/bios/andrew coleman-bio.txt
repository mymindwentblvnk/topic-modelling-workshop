Andrew Coleman is perhaps better known for his alter ego Animals on Wheels. Under that moniker, he released two albums and an EP for the highly respected  Ninja Tune label , in addition to numerous 12"s and compilation appearances on his own landmark Bovinyl imprint. Along with Bovinylmate Adam "Vert" Butler, Coleman was largely responsible for the UK jungle offshoot "drill n' bass" scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Coleman">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
