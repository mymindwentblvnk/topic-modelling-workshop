Formed in the summer of 2000 in Boston, Massachusetts, Cryptic Warning is an old-school thrash metal band with a love for brutal, technical death metal.

2005 marked the release of Cryptic Warning's debut full-length CD 'SANITY'S ABERRATION'. Combining shredding solos, lightning-fast riffs and unrelenting intensity, 'SANITY'S ABERRATION' is the best representation of what Cryptic Warning was all about.

In June of 2006, the Cryptic Warning name and songs were laid aside, so that the members could focus on their new project REVOCATION.
