Hey there Last.fm fans!   I am the only and original drummer who played with this band.  We started at the ages of 14-15 years old in Ottawa Illinois....  Played the local scene in bars by 17 years old!  Lol!!   We went to Hollywood Ca. in 1985 to attend school at Musicians Institute and graduated in March of 1986.  This record was recorded in Lagrange Illinois at SUNSET STUDIOS in the summer of 1985 and was released by IRON WORKS records in California.   Sadly... the lead guitar player and main music writer BRIAN HANLEY died in 1987 of a pre-existing heart condition.  The band retired after this tragic ending.  We all still play in our own respect.   Members where- BRIAN WILLIAMS vocals - BRIAN HANLEY lead guitar- JOE BAYER rhytym, lead guitar- and myself. KEVIN STILES drums.    I am so glad to see the music lives on.   Peace.
