Atmospheric black metal from Dominican Republic (Santo Domingo), formed in 2000.

The septet was founded in the year 2000 by guitarist Saethius as a one-man project called BLACK ALTAR and from the beginning on played Melodic Black Metal with keyboards. In the course of the next months he decided to search for other members and change the name into INFERNAL REQUIEM. Well, after one demo and a single we now have the 5-tracker “Pantheon“, again recorded on their own. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Infernal+Requiem">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
