Originally a solo project from Stanislav Govorukha, formerly of Auto da Fe, Coram Deo and Illuminandi. Cold and desolate, atmospheric Funeral-based Death/Doom that retains a lot of the hypnotic repetition of the former style against a tempo more suited to the latter. Mixes clean and extreme vocals to good effect, along with atmospheric keyboard touches to vary the guitar-led music. The line-up and the dramatic effects of the music further expanded after the band moved to Sweden in 2015.
