2) Prog Band fron Austria :

AGNUS DEI is a project of Gerald Krampl, band leader and keyboard player of former Austrian bands KYRIE ELEISON and INDIGO. He performs music inspired by his wife Hilde's simple yet elegant poems. Although the bilingual (German and English) lyrics are enclosed in the booklets, none are sung. The music style could be described as meditative new-age piano with keyboard orchestration and a tinge of prog.

AGNUS DEI have released four albums todate: "Lemuria" is an epic fantasy of the endangered crystal world, and "Merlyn" is a mystic dream journey to the inner world and visions of the great wizard. Unfortunately, Hilde died of cancer after its release and Krampl used some of the poems she had left behind to compose "Angelos" in 2003, then "Gaia" (a love song to earth) in 2004. Of the four albums, the latter is the more up tempo, more percussive and less meditative of the lot. AGNUS DEI generally goes for ambience and their albums are a pleasant, if limited and predictable listen.

Designed for dreaming, relaxing and comforting the soul, this material is recommended strictly for fans of VANGELIS, KITARO, David Lanz and the likes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Agnus+Dei">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
