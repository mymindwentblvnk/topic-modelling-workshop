Mittens On Strings (1954-58) were an influential rhythm and blues outfit from the North and West Sides of Chicago. Synthesizing a unique blend of uptown Jazz and an ecstatic interpretation of music that would later become known as Rock 'n' Roll, they influenced a number of other outfits from the era, including Frankenstein Bank Holiday, Time On My Hands, and the inimitable Frog Cock.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mittens+On+Strings">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
