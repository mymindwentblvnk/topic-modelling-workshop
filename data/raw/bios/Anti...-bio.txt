2) 

A fantastic Synth/Punk group from Greece. Only released a couple if cassettes and a split.  Members were Kwstas Aggelidis, Dimitris Diplas and Kwstas Panagopoulos.  The name was founded when one of the members tried writing anti nowhere league, but all that fit was Anti.  This here would be the first cassette self titled.
