Gortuary is a brutal death metal band from San Diego, United States. They formed in early 2006 by Oscar Padilla (Vocals), Andres Guzman (Guitar), Glenn Davis (Guitar), Jae Vizcaya (Bass) and Josh Mauney (Drums).

After awhile of practicing and writing music they started to play shows later that year. They self-released a demo called Splatter Fecal Matter and got the interest from labels. This led to a signing to Sevared Records, in 2007, to release their debut full-length album "Manic Thoughts of Perverse Mutilation" in 2008.  In 2010, they released their sophomore album Awakening Pestilent Beings.  They left Sevared Records and they are signed to Amputated Vein Records.  Amputated Vein Records released their third album Divine Indigenous Sacrament in 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gortuary">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
