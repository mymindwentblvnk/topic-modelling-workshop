Cresent is a dark heavy metal band, that hails from Greensboro, NC, USA. Formed in late 2000 by guitarist Alex Bledsoe and drummer Chris Tallman, they began with the vision of starting a band that didn't follow the latest trends and stayed true to the original form of metal. In the summer of 2001, they were joined by vocalist/guitarist Chris Parrish. It was at this point they started writing songs and developing the sound that would later be the band's trademark. Shortly there after they found bass player Preston Smith. Around this time, Chris made the decision to step down from playing guitar so that he could give the vocals the attention they deserved. Chris' longtime friend and former bandmate Jamie Lam was recruited to fill the guitarist spot. After a few short months of rehearsal, the band began playing shows in North Carolina and Virginia, steadily building a fanbase. In mid 2004, lead guitarist Troy Shaw replaced Jamie Lam, bringing with him a new dynamic to the band. They continued to play shows and released a demo in 2006. It was also around that time founding guitarist Alex decided to part ways with the band. Fortunately, Jamie had become available again and was first choice for the open spot. Which brings us to the present: Now a complete unit, Cresent is shopping their demo around for the right record label. Stronger than ever before, they are surely a force to be reckoned with.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Cresent">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
