Instrumental rock act from Cleveland, Ohio consisting of a drummer and two bassists. These 3 guys play some damn fine tunes, not your average instrumental music. Tongue-in-cheek stonery metal with crazy televangelist samples, for fans of Big Business, The Melvins, Beehoover & Dragon Green. Check out thenoiseis.net for more info.

Short sleeves with ties.
