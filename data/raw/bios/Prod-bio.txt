Prod' is dario orac (guItars,back voacals),Marko stavalj (drums),mario suPrna (bEss) and marKo tarabic (vocals).The idea of the band Prod starded out somewhere in the middle of year 2006. It was formed at first by three friends,but later to make the band bigger we called an extra singer - Marko.With his great vocal and singing style,he created totally different dimension to Prod.Untill he came all of the songs was made with Dario singing on them. The song ''Hera'' is one of them. This is the first real band for our drummer. Lead vocal Marko and bass player Mario were together in the metal band called Anborn.And guitarist Dario was singer in the band called Entropy.We're trying to make the things a little bit different and more interessting,and also trying to combine all our music influences such as Mastodon, Neurosis, High On Fire, Tool, Isis...in one single band.With brutal,math and mellancoly tunes we're trying to make music that we always wanted to listen,but never had a chance...
But even with such major influence,we still are trying to make our own sound,hoping original and unique. Our music is based on modern metal but the foundation of our songs are never the same.We combine progressive,rock,blues,death metal,hardcore and many other music genres so we could express our selves. 

2.) Prod is also an alternative rock band from berlin, germany.
