Ayano Tsuji (つじあやの) is a Japanese singer, songwriter and ukulele player.

Ayano was born in 1978, in Kyoto, Japan. In high school, she loved folk music, but found her hands were too small to play guitar. So she tried the ukulele. Her love for the instrument grew, and she has been playing the ukulele ever since.

In an NPR interview, she was quoted as saying: "If my songs were a motion picture, they would not be an action film. They would be a slow, typical love story, in which there is some happiness, and much pain. This reflects everyday life, and that's what I want."

Ayano's hobbies are watching movies and cycling.
