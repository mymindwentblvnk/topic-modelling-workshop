Vincente de Teba Költerhoff (born October 18, 1978), better known as Frauenarzt (German for gynaecologist, literally "The Women's Doctor"), is a German rapper from Berlin-Tempelhof, also known as "DJ Kologe," "MC Digital F," "Arzt," "Gyniko," and "Günther." Frauenarzt was well-known for his sexually explicit, Miami bass style music. Since 2008 he began to produce electro-hop/house songs, together with Manny Marc as duo Die Atzen.

In 2009, the duo got their breakthrough with the hit single "Das geht ab," following that with "Disco Pogo".

The sexual themes prevalent in his songs have brought criticism from SPD politician Monika Griefahn, who cited Frauenarzt among other German rappers in her argument for stricter regulation of pornographic rap in Germany. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Die+Atzen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
