Explicit Hate is a Thrash formed in 1986 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  They released 4 demos and one album in 1988, A View From The Other Side.

The brothers and founders of the band, Gus and Rod Santoro, after a break of 19 years, decided to revive the project along with Alex Kaffer (Guitar) and Joel Jr. (Bass).

Leon Manssur never used to play in Explicit Hate. He played in a band called Slaughter that changed their name to Devastation (band that years later would be Explicit Hate). The only relationship Leon had with Explicit Hate was through the track Angels of Hell (originally by Devastation) which was later re-recorded for the 1988 Ruins of Ambition demo. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Explicit+Hate">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
