2. As an activist, promoter, and MC, Oddity has brought a new breath of hope to the hip hop game and to all musical genres. With a gripping voice along with a unique style and a mind ripping delivery he brings a new sound to a monotonous genre. Bringing social awareness with fresh relevant lyrics and banging tracks, his debut album ‘Illegal Truth’ knocks with a vengeance as his lyrics breathe life to hard-to-swallow reality, the struggle, hip hop and government conspiracies. After years of playing shows, freestyling on corners to working and writing with various artists, this project will give Oddity his long overdue shine
