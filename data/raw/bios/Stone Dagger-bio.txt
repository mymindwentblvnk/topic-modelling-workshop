Brendan Radigan, vocalist of Magic Circle, Battle Ruins, etc. strikes out on his own as STONE DAGGER (with the help of a couple of studio musicians), delivering the kind of working class power metal the USA has been historically known for. Stone Dagger is heavily indebted to Manilla Road's "classic period", but also brings to mind other bands of the era like early Omen, Obsession, and of course Manowar. There's also an undeniable European influence, maybe comparable to the likes of Heavy Load. A nice debut, capped off with period appropriate production and presentation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stone+Dagger">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
