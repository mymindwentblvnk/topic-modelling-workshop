From the beautiful skies of Belgium has risen Newmoon. A five piece post-punk band layered in reverb and influenced by volume. Forming in 2013 as a two man project, quickly became full over a matter of months they recorded their debut EP “Invitation to Hold” shortly thereafter. With sounds reflecting 90’s heroes Slowdive and modern bands as The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Newmoon bears the innocence and humbleness to become much more than they could ever expect. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/newmoon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
