Kaiowas’s two founding members, Denner Vieira (Guitars) and Rick Pivetta (Drums) hail from Brazil and moved to America in search of a band to realize the music coursing through their veins. 

Formed less than two years ago Kaiowas has quickly developed their unique style by immersing themselves into their music with lengthy, free-flowing rehearsal sessions at their home studio where they reinvent ideas until a song is born.

The LA-based band Kaiowas debuted its self-titled EP on November 12, 2008. The five-song collection is truly a statement amidst today’s progressive metal scene. Long-time Tool producer Sylvia Massy says, “Kaiowas is one of the most exciting [bands] I’ve heard for a long time.”

The band name, Kaiowas, is inspired by the Brazilian tribe who committed mass suicide rather than relinquish their land to local farmers, having had their own government turn their back on them. The songs in the newly released Kaiowas EP invoke feelings of love, tragedy, anger, lust and greed and subtly suggest the road less traveled may be the key to salvation.

The EP is available on iTunes, Amazon.com and all other digital outlets as well as physically on cdbaby.com.
