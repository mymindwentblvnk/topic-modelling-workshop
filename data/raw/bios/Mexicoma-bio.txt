Mexicoma was formed in early 2005 by long time friends who wanted to play some kind of rock music with a lot of love and heavy stoner vibes. After a few rehearsals, the song writing were flowing. Five songs were quickly made just by riffing in the rehearsal room. To have fun and jam was the key of existence. And they sure had a blast, surprising eachother with great ideas, sad hymns, experimenting tunes and agressive riffs. 

But Mexicomas major problem was to find a singer that could set the final touch to the amazing stoner riffs they made. And In order to get this going, they needed one hell of a singer. And they found him!! 

The 5 ended up 6 with the line-up consisting of: Magnus Olsson, vocals. Peter Norstedt, Niklas Wiberg and Olle sjölund on guitars. Robert 'Rob Rod' Kerstis playing the bass and Nils Lidstöm on the drums. Now the band was complete. And the magic feeling of playing and sounding exactly what they wanted accured. To get the first songs out of there heads, and get a clearer feeling of what they really sounded like, Mexicoma recorded there first demo in late summer of 2005. It was a great step in the right direction. 

Their minds are now set, not on conquering the world but to have fun, play the music they love, the music make there existence complete, and share it with you on stage. Mexicoma started off this summer by supporting the mighty Abramis Brama and Dexter Jones Circus Orchestra. And right now Mexicoma is recording a full length album with producer Jimmy Ågren. Due to be released in late 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mexicoma">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
