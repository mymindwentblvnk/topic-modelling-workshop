Dry Cleaning is a British post-punk band formed in south London in 2018.. Comprising longtime friends Lewis Maynard, Tom Dowse, Florence Shaw, and Nick Buxton, the band initially formed after a karaoke party in 2017 and made some instrumentals. Six months later, Shaw — a university lecturer and picture researcher by day — joined the fold as their vocalist, a first-time endeavour for her. The band's debut album, New Long Leg, was released in 2021. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dry+Cleaning">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
