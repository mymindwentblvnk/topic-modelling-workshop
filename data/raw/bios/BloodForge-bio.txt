band formed in September, 2004 in São Paulo, Brazil. Its main characteristic is the female vocals, which alternates with male and guttural vocals. The main band influences goes from Doom to Gothic Metal, and sounding also like some 80's Heavy Metal, as well as the 70's Progressive, as a result of its members’ experiences in other bands and musical projects.

Its composing has the commitment to show that in spite of every single situation a person may be, there will always be a Light capable to drive all dark away. The lyrics are honestly written and talks about personal situations, thoughts and ideas about living, feelings and the supernatural around us.

The first CD-EP, "Forged", released in Abril/2005, counts on the tracks "Show You the Way", "Inside my Mind" and "Morning Star". This album tells the story of a character and the process that leads his life to be molded – forged - as the raw metal in a blacksmith's forge. The cover art is composed by the elements of this theme, and demonstrates the possibility of hope and change among mankind’s degradation.

In July/2005, Bloodforge was the winner in a festival with other fifteen bands in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Today the band is performing throughout Brazil, and preparing the complete official CD.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/BloodForge">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
