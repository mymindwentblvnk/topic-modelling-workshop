Odenwrath is built upon myths and legends of epic proportions. The brutal battles, mysterious foes, blood-soaked pacts and mystical forces can all be experienced in the music! The music embraces imagery from the Medieval, Viking and Fantasy realm. Death Metal and Thrash riffs collide with melodic interludes characteristic of the Swedish Death Metal scene,the Bay Area Thrash scene and beyond!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Odenwrath">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
