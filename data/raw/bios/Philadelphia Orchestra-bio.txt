The Philadelphia Orchestra, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is one of the "Big Five" symphony orchestras in the United States and usually considered among the finest in the world. For the greater part of its history, the orchestra gave its concerts at the Academy of Music. Since 2001, its subscription concerts have been performed at Verizon Hall in the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, down the street from the Academy of Music, although the orchestra returns to the Academy of Music for its annual gala concert. The Philadelphia Orchestra also performs an annual series of concerts at Carnegie Hall. Past music directors include Fritz Scheel, Carl Pohlig, Leopold Stokowski, Eugene Ormandy, Ricardo Muti, Wolfgang Sawallisch, and Christoph Eschenbach. Charles Dutoit is currently the chief conductor.
