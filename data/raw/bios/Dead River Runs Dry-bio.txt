A charred black slab of ruthless venom that only a country like Australia could spit out, Dead River Runs Dry is an obsession with the annihilation of constraint, a savage reaction to existence as determined by ignorance and an insight into further paradigms that are offered through experience alone...  

After receiving accolades from around the globe for their ominous Winter 2012 release and delivering a series of blistering live performances on Australiaâ€™s eastern front, Dead River Runs Dry's debut album HIEROPHANTS OF THE STORM is available now: https://deadriverrunsdry.bandcamp.com/
