The story of Baht has begun by the time Bilgehan had decided to involve into the Turkish metal scene with something oriental and progressive with original sound. In the spring of 2007, he came together with Doruk to work on his music. After a two-song demo –which is unreleased- Ersin joined the band to handle the bass duties. In 2008, the trio decided to record an EP album to extend their position among local metal bands. In the spring of next year, they recorded a five-song EP album Bilinçten Derine with all the songs in Turkish and Baht's product. This album was unique by being in Turkish, and received good comments from the metalheads of Turkey and from all around the world as well. As the time goes by, the band performed in many local bars and rock festivals. After a while, it was a necessity for the band to show up with a new record to take the band to the next level. Hence, Baht has recorded their last album Resurgence Hour in 2009, with Joona Räsänen on drums. The concept of the songs is based on individual’s struggle with life, death and self. The songs consist of dark and heavy rhythms besides local melodies and mostly brutal vocals.
