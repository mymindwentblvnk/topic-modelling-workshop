Infinitus Mortus is a symphonic metal band from New Jersey, USA. Their songs alternate between piano-heavy and guitar-heavy melodies with ever-powerful drum rhythms, and they aren't afraid to experiment with different sounds (such as the sitar in Dissolve and organ in Beauty, Lust, A Fake Love). Formed by Stephen Megna, their debut EP, 2012, was released in 2010, followed by the 2012 full-length release The Conspiracy of Love, a concept album about the pain and heartache of love. Megna has played and still plays all of the instruments. The present singers are a sibling duo: Caitlin Meehan and Vincent James Meehan. The lyrics to The Conspiracy of Love were written by Rebeca Proa√±o.
