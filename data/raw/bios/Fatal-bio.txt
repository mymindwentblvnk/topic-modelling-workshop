Fatal (Death Metal - Le Havre, France) :

" FATAL: they conquer! " Its what you can hear at the end of the concerts where FATAL delivers its incisive and powerful Thrash Death that the band qualifies itself as BARBARIK DEATH METAL 

FATAL is a combo from France (Le Havre), which was born in 1997 in the deeper metal underground. 
Changes of line up influenced the musical direction of the band as you can feel it through its 4 CD, thus multiplying aggressiveness, but also the technik and the effectiveness of the songs.

Summer 2002 is entirely devoted to the recording of the 1st album: ` ESKHATON' at the ` OCTOSON studio' (Le Havre) produced at 500 specimens by the band . (with a CD-ROM track including lyrics, pictures and video clip done by BOHR )

In 2003, GANDALF (bass) came into FATAL which enlarged the rows of the death tribe composed now by SKULL (singer), JOHN (guitar), OLIVIER (guitar), & MEHDI (drums). "ESKHATON (Greek): eschatology: doctrines relative to the last ends of the humanity and to the ultimate transformation of the world " 

The albums design is due to a work of ROLAND KISTNER, German famous artist who cordially accepted to take part to this new opus. ( http://www.kistner-art.de/ ) 

After 3 years of stage through France, but also Belgium or Switzerland, Fatal really became to make its own reputation, playing with bands like CANNIBAL CORPSE, KATAKLYSM, ABORTED, NO RETURN, CANCER, PSORIASIS, PITBULLS IN THE NURSERY...

In 2006, FATAL is back on studio to record its next album,
and after some changes, get a new guitarist (Alex ) and bassist (Ben ). 

Some of the bands FATAL shared the stage with : 
CANNIBAL CORPSE - KATAKLYSM - ABORTED - CANCER - HAPPY FACE - GTI - PSORIASIS - PITBULLS IN THE NURSERY - KRONOS - POLLUTED INHERITANCE - EVIL WORMS - BENIGHTED - DSK - DECLINE OF HUMANITY - CESSPIT - FURIA - NO RETURN - GENITAL GRINDER - WARGASM - NEURINOME - STRAIGHT - VEHEMENS - SENTENCE - YYRKOON - FOREST IN BLOOD - KORUM - SOLSTIS - ROTTING FAITH - SCYTHES - ASHURA - ANOREXIA NERVOSA - VIKINGS & CELTS - ACALMY - ULTRA VOMIT - SHURIM - GORROTTED - IN QUEST - SHYVA - STRONGHOLD - ZE BELLES BETES UNDERGROUND & NICO - MANIAC - BESTIAL PERVERSION - EAR DESTRUCT UNDERWASH - 7 COLD SHADOWS - BIRTH DECLINE - REPUDIATE - FATE - MORTFINE - SMALL BAD TRIP - DRAFT - DROWNING - ANTAGONY - TRIDUS ELASTICUS - VAKARM - OBTURATED - UNTOLD - WARGUS - EMPTINESS - CEREBRAL NECROSE - SHEDDING SKIN - DYSLESIA - HERETIK - ECLYPSE - DECOHERENCE - AOD - OUTCAST - INSECTS & FUCKING MORE... & FUCKING MORE TO COME. 

Fatal (Jan Burton fronted four piece, London):

What can be said about FATAL...? They certainly don't drink from the Mainstream,... fusing lush Electronica with Organic Instrumentation Soundscapes, that has mighty fine groove, addictive melody and poise. It absolutely delivers and captivates.

Jan Burton has the voice of a non-conformist Angel of the deep, tainted with a burning heart that's both Sublime and Majestic... "You've got to learn to live and love and die at the same time. You expect respect, but neglect the feelings on the inside". You get me?

Andy Gray is the technical Wonder kid, responsible for the Musical backdrop and Doctored wizardry. Andy's history and experience are too long and impressive to even mention right here, but in short, Andy is a writer/producer and remixer and has worked with Tori Amos, Liz Fraser, Gary Numan, Korn and U2. He wrote The Big Brother theme tune (channel 4), he also scores for movies including Swordfish, (John Travolta) Timecop II. They first came together when Jan was in a band called SYNTAX and released a Debut called MECCANO MIND. Andy Post Produced and Arranged a number of those tracks to the highest order, resulting in Meccano Minds Highlights. An excellent album in Diversity and Emotive Beauty (a Lost Classic) that lacked support from the label it was signed to.

PRAY landed in the top 40 at number 27, championed by Pete Tong, Rampling, Digweed, Joe Wiley and Mary Anne Hobbs giving it Record of the week. PRIDE also featured in very relevant episodes and scenes in the O.C and Nip Tuck. Jan and Andy have come together and written from scratch some very innovative and mesmerising tunes that are difficult to pigeon hole or ignore.

Jan's voice is unusual and a one off. FATALs more contemporary comparisons are Chemical Brothers, Zero 7,Underworld, Air, Antony and the Johnsons. Jan has also contributed four stand out tracks to the recently released debut album from San Francisco's finest DJ outfit, Gabriel & Dresden (www.gabrielanddresden.com) which was released after rave reviews and an outrageous launch at the WMC this year (winter music conference, Miami). Jan has also sung with Moby but meat got in the way!

Fingers crossed, FATAL is in the middle of talks to get signed up and brought to the masses.

Fatal (Russian darkwave)
Band was formed by three men from Moscow, whose names become widely-heard later becouse of their own musical projects. 

Line up:
Eugene Voronovsky ("Cisfinitum") - keyboards, effects.
Roman Sidorov ("Staruha Mha", "Der Golem", "Sedative") - vocals
Eugene "Ych" Soloviov ("Model") - guitar, programming

The band left behind single record (made in autumn 1998), containing very few tracks. Fatal pervormed transparent, slow and tranquil music. But Sidorov's unique gloomy detached voice adds a lot of gothic-suicidal-darkwave tendencies to trip-hop-like electronic backgrounds.




-  Fatal is a member of the Haitian hip-hop group RockFam Lame a (or just RockFam). Before that he came onto the scene as part of a group named Brave Guys.

Fatal - Oi punk band from Germany

Die 1998 gegründete Bielefelder Oi Punk Band Fatal, wuchs erst 7 Jahre später aus ihren Kinderschuhen. 
Nach einer langen Phase starker Trunkenheit und nicht wirklich ernsthaften Musikalischen Exzessen, die in einer ursprünglich anderen Besetzung (Boris/Schlagzeug, Mirco/Gitarre/Gesang, Christoph/Gitarre/Gesang, Michael/Bass) statt fanden, ging es nie über die Mauern der Proberäumlichkeiten hinaus. 
Ein letztes Mal wurden die Karten 2005 neu gemischt, und die Trommelstäbchen an Robin weiter gegeben. Alex vergeht sich seit etwa 2003 an seiner 4-Saitigen Schlampe. Christoph und Mirco sind ihren vorlieblichen Stellungen treu geblieben. Die Musik wurde schmutziger und es ging durstig aber stätig voran. 
Musikalisch bietet Fatal eine gesunde Mischung zum nachdenken, saufen und ficken.
