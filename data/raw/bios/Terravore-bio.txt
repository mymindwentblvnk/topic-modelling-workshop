Terravore is a bulgarian old-school thrash-death metal band from Varna. Formed in the early spring of 2015 by Kalin Buchvarov (bass/vocals, Mass Cremation) and Ivan Lazarov (guitars/vocals, Abductor, ex-Nema Labavo). The project started two months earlier under another name, but after the affiliation of Trendafil Trendafilov (drums, ex-Mass Cremation, ex-Mental DIsorder), the project name was changed to Terravore and the band started working with full force. Several months later the band started to perform gigs in Varna, and a mini tour in Bulgaria during September 2015, as a support to a Greek thrash metal band. In January 2016 Terravore records an EP, which will be released soon, and two single  studio tracks, which will appear on two international compilations. In 2017 the band records and releases a full-length called "Unforeseen Consequences" through the American metal label "Stormspell Records". In 2018 Boiko Nikolaev joins the band as second/lead guitar. In 2019 the band releases a split album with their friends "Many More" and also an EP called "We Came To Destroy". Terravore shared stages with different artists like: Kreator, Necronomicon, Suicidal Angels, Korpiklaani, Chronosphere, Testament, Nervosa, Suffocation, Pyogenesis and many more.
