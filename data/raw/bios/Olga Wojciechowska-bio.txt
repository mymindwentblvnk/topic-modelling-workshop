Olga Wojciechowska is a Polish composer, producer and multi-instrumentalist whose work drifts between modern classical, experimental and electronic music.

Wojciechowska’s original compositions are frequently sought out by acclaimed directors and choreographers for dance, theatre and multimedia projects around the world.

Her commissioned work includes music for Constellation, Puz/zle, Genesis & Pluto by Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, music for The Moon Opera by Yabin Wang and for Woman and Cygne by Daniel Proietto. Her score for Cygne was performed by an orchestra at Oslo Opera House and used in Wim Wenders’ “Cathedral of Culture” motion picture.

In 2019 she makes her Royal Opera House debut as the composer for Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui’s Medusa.

In December 2015, a collection of Olga’s commissioned work was released by American record label, Time Released Sound on her debut album, Maps and Mazes. Critical reception to this work was very positive and as a result, Olga’s immersive and introverted music caught the positive attention of fans, record labels and publications. Her music has since been featured in high-profile compilations released by Ninja Tune, Traum Schallplatten and The Wire. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Olga+Wojciechowska">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
