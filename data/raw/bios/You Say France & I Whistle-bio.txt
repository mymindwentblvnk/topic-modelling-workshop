You Say France & I Whistle is a swedish indiepop band with a lot of energy and melodies.

The band consists of six members (including a squirrel) that - even though they're still mostly guitarbased - constantly tries to blend in different instruments such as accordions, glockenspiels, old casio keyboards and washboards, but always combined with a steaming drum and bass section and three simultaneous lead singers.

The band has been playing on a variety of venues in Sweden, mostly in Stockholm, and are influenced by artists like Flaming Lips, Kings of Leon, Beck, Cure, Arcade Fire, MGMT, Vampire Weekend, Bob Log III, Architecture in Helsinki, Beatles, Beach Boys, Daft Punk, Justice and many many more. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/You+Say+France+&+I+Whistle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
