Enrique Collado (Vitoria, 1974)

He primarily makes music with FL Studio Sytrus, Nexus, AAS, and Adobe Audition.

His musical influences are not very electronic, and it shows in his songs partly because they are electronic items in their sound but not so much as to its structure. Highlight in his musical influences: Echo and the Bunnymen, Kraftwerk, the mission, vangelis, the postal service, pixies, u2, placebo, ...

Some of my songs have been used in soundtracks of films. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pictures">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
