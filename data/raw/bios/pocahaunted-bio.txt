Pocahaunted (often shortened by the band to P-haunt) was a psychedelic pop duo formed in 2005 in Los Angeles, CA, by Amanda Brown and Bethany Cosentino (subsequently in the duo Best Coast). The duo disbanded in August 2010.

The self-proclaimed "Olsen twins of blissed out drone" from Eagle Rock, California, United States was envisioned by musicians Amanda Brown and Bethany Cosentino. Debuting in 2006 with cassettes Moccasinging and What the Spirit Tells Me, Pocahaunted quickly rose to become one of the most popular Not Not Fun related bands releasing several albums (including the critically acclaimed work Island Diamonds) on various underground labels. They have been described as a journey through the celestial mind, whatever that means and they play a unique brand of hypnotic droning psychedelic bliss, an earthy sound conjuring unearthly visions. 

From spring 2009, Pocahaunted was Amanda Brown, Britt Brown (Robedoor), Leyna Tilbor (Psychic Reality), Diva Dompe (Blackblack), Ged Gengras (M. Geddes Gengras, Robedoor). 

The duo formally disbanded on 17th August 2010.

Cosentino now records as a member of indie pop band Best Coast.
