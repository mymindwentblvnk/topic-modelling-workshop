For centuries Sri Lanka has slowly been turning away from its rich cultural heritage. A heritage soaked in Blood, Brutality, War and Hate as well as being entrenched in Peace, Honour and Mind warping Spiritualistic rituals. In 2008 a group of Individuals decided to address this slow fade of ancient knowledge. Out Of their Longing to see their countries culture revert to the tiems of old, Raaksha was born

Formed in the early dawn of 2008, Beelzebub and Deshapriya came together with a concept. A concept which Raaksha Projects. The concept of projecting the beauty and atrocity of ancient realms to modern day society. The unique genre of Pure Hela Metal is charactarised by furiousy shredded guitar riffs with bowel shaking bass and animalistically decimated drum lines with Inhuman Shrieks and growls.

Raaksha disowns any other brand of hela metal, be it Shri metal or Hela black metal. We stay true to Hela Metal alone. As in the times of old, we hold our banner up high and take no prisoners.

Raaksha is influenced by the deep dark sounds of Blackened Doom and Old school Black Metal, characterized by screeching vocals, thundering double bass sounds that blend with melodic guitar solos, raw guitar rhythms and traditional Sri Lankan percussion.

Raaksha's main influence is the Heavy metal gods Black Sabbath. Along side with bands like Iron maiden, Venom, Bathory, Katatonia, Carpathian Forest, Bethlehem, Om, Isis, Meshuggah, Rudra, Necromantia, Dark fortress, Catamenia, Emperor, Dissection, Borknagar, Draconian, Candlemass,Isolation, Drudhk and Sri Lankan Black Metal gods Siblings of hatred and Forlorn Hope. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Raaksha">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
