1.CAÑA Flamenca is a group of creatively thinking musicians, who under the guidance of a guitarist and composer Matjaž Stošić create and perform original music in the spirit of Spanish Flamenco.
In the last six years they have created their own repertoire which gives the band a unique sound and style. Strong and reach rhythmic undertones of guitar compositions reflect the temperament and emphasize the very heart of the band, which can be by the sounds of additional instruments placed in the so-called style of Flamenco Nuevo.
While playing, they magically create all the power, passion, lightness and vivacity of this musical sub-genre. When this temperamental rhythm is accompanied with a similarly impassioned dance, the happening on the stage carries us right into the cradle and heart of flamenco, by which nobody is left calm. realeditorbest profile toolsrealeditorbest profile tools
