Formed in 1990 by Paul Zavaleta (Guitar/Vocals) & Jon Brody (Drums), they together recruited Will Kuberski on lead guitar & Jim Hoffman on bass. Deteriorot recorded their first demo in 1992, dominating the first half of the 90's by frequently playing shows with Obituary, Entombed, Unleashed, Incantation and many others which earned Deteriorot a large fan base and local following along with notoriety among metal fanzines around the world. 

Deteriorot went into the studio and recorded an EP for Afterworld Records entitled "Ceremonies Of Blasphemy", but the record label fell through due to financial problems and never released it. Shortly after, Deteriorot was offered a contract with Drowned Productions. Winter 1992 was spent in the studio recording their next release with new bassist Chris Machado (now in Ill Ni√±o). In summer 1993 Deteriorot released an EP on Drowned Productions entitled "Manifested Apparitions Of Unholy Spirits" with a much darker, heavier sound. A follow up full length album was in the works, but due to Drowned Productions going out of business, the album was never produced and eventually they went their separate ways. 

Deteriorot returned after a long hiatus with all the original founding members: Paul, Jon and Will. The new release picked up exactly where "Manifested" left off, with the Deteriorot sound remaining largely the same due to the songs still being written and arranged by Paul Zavaleta & Jon Brody. In January 2001 bassist O.D. Lallo joined the band after the departue of long time guitarist Will Kuberski. Their latest album, "In Ancient Beliefs" was originally released in October 2001 by the now defunct WW3 Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deteriorot">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
