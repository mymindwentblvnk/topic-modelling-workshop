From self-titled EP:
Jason Bunnel - Lead Vocals
Frank Hernandez - Guitars
Mike Walish - Guitars
Erin Fyfe - Bass

(The band has since signed on Ira Black as the lead guitarist, apparently replacing Frank Hernandez.)

A virtually unknown band from California's Bay Area, early 2000's band Doom Society vows to break through the current scene of dull music and show the world the brutal face of heavy metal. Doom Society is aggressively pursuing its new goal of a U.S. tour and extending to Europe and beyond.
