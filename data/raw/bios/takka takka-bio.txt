Takka Takka is a foursome indie rock band from Brooklyn and Queens. Singer-guitarist-keyboardist Gabe Levine says their name comes from "writing songs about war, and it's a painting about war, with machine guns going, 'TAKKA TAKKA.'" Other band members are Conrad Doucette, Damion Jurrens, and JP Jones. They cite their influences as: the Kinks, Orange Juice (sometimes Orange Julius), Pavement, Lou Reed, Zombies, Johnny Cash, Echo and the Bunnymen, the Magnetic Fields, Brian Eno, REM, Bob Dylan, and OMD. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Takka+Takka">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
