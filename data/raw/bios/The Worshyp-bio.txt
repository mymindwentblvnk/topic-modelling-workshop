The Worshyp are a Heavy Metal based out of Toronto, Canada. The bands founder Marz Nova named the band The Worshyp as a salute to how heavy metal fans love, and almost worship, their music as if it were a religion to them. The name has no ties to any real organized religion.
In the spring of 2010 Marz recruited Danish guitarist Thor Rune as well as bassist Mig Diablo & KK Devina both from Peru and former band members of Ex Iron Maiden Vocalist Paul Di'Anno.
The band's chemistry is based on strong vocal melodies sang over driving guitar riffs set to todays lower tunings.
