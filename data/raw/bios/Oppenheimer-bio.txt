Oppenheimer was an indie pop electronica band from Belfast, Northern Ireland formed in 2004. The band is made up of musicians Shaun Robinson and Rocky O'Reilly, both of whom were once members of the now disbanded Belfast group, Torgas Valley Reds. The band's popularity has been steadily increasing, and they have toured with several notable acts including Regina Spektor, Architecture in Helsinki, The Bravery, The Chalets, They Might Be Giants, OK Go, and The Presidents of the United States of America. Their music has also been used in television shows, including "Rockville, CA", "How I Met Your Mother", "Ugly Betty" and "Gossip Girl".

The band insists that, contrary to popular belief, they are are not actually named after physicist Robert Oppenheimer. Instead, they claim that their title was chosen purely on the basis of it sounding good.

In late 2009, the band announced their forthcoming split via their website, citing a changed level of passion and commitment they could give to the band. They are planning to release a farewell EP in early 2010 and will play their last live show at Belfast's Spring and Airbrake on December 19th 2009. Shaun will be taking 'new and different path in his life' while Rocky said his 'ideas, dreams and notions for writing, recording and touring are more alive and vibrant than ever.'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oppenheimer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
