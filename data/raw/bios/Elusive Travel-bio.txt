Death metal meets red house painters & chicken tacos with sour cream

Elusive Travel was formed in Rochester,NY in the summer of 1996.Founding member " Chris Dalcin/guitar/vocals" began working on material that would appear on both Watchmen Studio compliations 1 & 2 under his own name.After the fall of Windbreed featuring (Tim Yeung/HateEternal/Nile/Hank the 3rd on drums) Chris decided it was the right time to start on his own.After 4 years of compiling over 20 demo tracks ranging from all sorts of styles, death,doom,trance,darkwave,black metal & rock,it was time for the first offcial release "My Final Demise".After relocating to Cincinnati,Ohio in 2000 & putting together a full band line-up the band would complete the album release it in 2001.With the band never really stopping the regional touring some of the better shows have been, Metalfest 15,Cleveland's Music Macabre 2000,World Series of Metal 2002 & Cincinnati Punk/Metalfest 2004.Some of the great acts we've have played with are Rain Fell Within,Thorns of the Carrion,Estuary,Macabre,Enslaved,Electric Wizard,Evoken,Avernus,Anathema,Brave,Bleed for Me,Fledgling Death,Keen of the Crow & 137.In 2003 Chris released an EP called "You caved my Karma In" which included 3 songs featuring only 2 tracks of minimal vocals & clean guitar.Proving a handful of solo shows proved to the metal community that ET would break the barriers of what a metal band should be.With more touring running through 2003-2005 Elusive managed to reach NY,Wis,Ill,IN,KY,OH & VA. The Spring of 2005 ET released a split 7 inch with Rochester doomsters 137 Separation/In Vain would be a limited run of 300 records, withing a short time sold out! But still avail through some online distros.Elusive Travel entered Watchmen Studio's Sept of 04' for the recording of third release/second full-length "Breathe Before You Die" which will end up featuring Rick McCoy (Avernus),Dawn Desiree(Rain Fell Within), & Alex Neidt.The 8 songs selected for the cd will surely widen the fanbase of anyone who claims Doom,death,darkwave,indie,ambient to be something of their desire.Down tuning in A combined with huge sludgy dirge, doublebass mayhem,screaming to the depths of solitude and haunting clean etheral vocals bring a healthy mix of dark brooding tones which paint a bleak picture of darkness.With the remaining of 2006, Elusive Travel will commense a mini tour of the NorthEast with Indy Doomsters Apostile of Solitude in MID OCT.With more and more ideas coming to Chris's mind the band decided to take much more time on the completion of the album,making sure nothing was left unturned, so to ease the demand of a new Elusive release the band decided to release a 10th anniversary complation of 8 tracks containing a deep mixture of the bands first song ever recorded in 1996 to a rough mix of the newest track that would on the upcoming new cd "Breathe Before You Die". This compilation would be titled "I Emptied The Sea".
