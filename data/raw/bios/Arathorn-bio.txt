Arathorn play medieval/old fashioned sounding raw black metal, with keyboard samples and other instruments added in to add to the atmosphere. Atmosphere is everything with Arathorn. The medieval, and somewhat folky sounds put Arathorn into a category of their own. A very unique band, and one that would not easily be matched by other bands. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arathorn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
