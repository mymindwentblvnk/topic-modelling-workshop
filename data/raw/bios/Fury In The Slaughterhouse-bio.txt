Fury in the Slaughterhouse were formed in Hannover, Germany, in 1987 by brothers Kai Uwe Wingenfelder (vocals) and Thorsten Wingenfelder (guitar, vocals). The siblings then added Rainer Schumann (drums), Christof Stein (guitar), and Hannes Schafer (bass). Fury in the Slaughterhouse's self-titled debut LP was released on January 10, 1989; keyboardist Gero Drnek also joined the band that year. In 1996, original bassist Hannes Schäfer was replaced by Christian Decker.

In 2007, the band announced the release of a career-spanning retrospective called "Don't look back", to be accompanied by a tour. Following the completion of that tour in late August 2008, the group entered an indefinite hiatus. 

The brothers Wingenfelder reformed as Wingenfelder & Wingenfelder and have released three albums and a b-sides album, with plans record a fourth in 2017. Rainer Schumann released a solo album under the name Schumann. Christof Stein formed Wohnraumhelden and has released three albums under that name. 

In 2016, the band reformed for their 30th anniversary, and released a new track. Additional new tracks were included in the band's new retrospective "30 - The Ultimate Best Of Collection."
