Molly Sweeney was born in Sault Ste Marie, Ontario, the youngest of five children. She grew up in Northern Michigan and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, returning to Canada to attend McGill University. Graduating with a degree in Cultural Studies, she found herself eminently well-qualified to bartend. Working at a music venue in the heart of Montreal's indie scene and playing the coffeehouse circuit, she met many of her future friends and collaborators, including composer Sam Shalabi, who recruited her to appear on his 2009 Land of Kush album Against the Day. She collaborated with Shalabi on a number of soundtracks and live performances, and sang the title track from Land of Kush's 2010 album Monogamy.

Sweeney released her debut album Gold Rings and Fur Pelts in June 2011 to critical acclaim, with Ann Powers of NPR comparing her to “a young Kate Bush” and The Globe and Mail likening her to Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell, with “emotions and stories that are deeply cast and artfully arranged.” Matthew Fiander of Popmatters wrote “it’s her delivery, with all the control and emotion of a seasoned soul singer, that makes her a unique talent.”

Sweeney’s folk-infused torch songs explore the dark side of rapture, showcasing her sultry, dramatic vocals and enigmatic lyrics. Gold Rings and Fur Pelts features nine songs that conjure up an elemental world of longing, passion, and poetry with “moments of aching loveliness” (Pitchfork), including Not Faithfull, Spirit, Will I See You, and You Mustn’t Worry.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Molly+Sweeney">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
