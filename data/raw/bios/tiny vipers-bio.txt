Tiny Vipers is the stage name of Jesy Fortino, an acoustic musician from Seattle, Washington, United States. After having started out as a more conventional pop singer-songwriter, she has since developed a very distinct style. She uses both minimal but complicated melodies and techniques that move her away from the pop sound of "Hands Across the Void" into more abstract music.
Her guitar technique is very acute, and during live performances, she will play non-repeating instrumental guitar parts between songs. It is hard to tell when one song ends and the next begins, or what is improvised and what is written.
"Life on Earth" was released on July 7, 2009 on Sub Pop. Luckyhorse Industries will release a limited edition 180 gram double vinyl on November 16, 2009, which will include a bonus track "Audrey's Well".
