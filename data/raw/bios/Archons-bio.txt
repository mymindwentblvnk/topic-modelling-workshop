Everything began in the summer of 2004 when Simon Charette, SÃ©bastien Audet, Christian Poulin and Charles Fontaine decided to found a group of melodic death metal called Wrecked Mind. However, near the end of 2004 the group collapsed. Pushed by a wind of renewal, they set up in 2006 a project called Archons with guitarist Francis Beaulieu. In 2008 the album "The Consequences of Silence," produced by Yannick St-Amant and under the label Cryogenic Records, was presented to the world. The group announced their break-up on March 17, 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Archons">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
