There's at least two bands that share the same band name:

1) Acrania were a British deathcore band from London, England that formed in 2012. Having already toured with various acts around Europe including Cerebral Bore and Warpath, and with upcoming shows booked alongside Thy Art Is Murder, Blood Red Throne and many more, Acrania will continue to devour their way through the scene and spread their message of unrelenting hostility through their blistering mix of brutality, slams and blastbeats. Debut album Totalitarian Dystopia due for release August 19, 2014 through Unique Leader Records.

Band Members:
Luke Griffin - Vocals
Jack Simmons - Guitars
Jake Hadley -- Drums

2) Acrania is a band founded in Mexico City in the summer of 2001. It is a project that proposes a different musical style, with strong Melodic Death influences, complementing music with different latin rhythms and melodies and with other instruments that aren't the classical Metal, such as jarana, teponaxtle, congas, pailas, saxophone etc. Acrania has created a very unique sound and gives a different and innovative proposal.
