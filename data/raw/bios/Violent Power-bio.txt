Violent Power is a progressive heavy metal band from S & Fj, Norway. The project was formed by brothers TJ Cobra and George W. Blofeld in 1989, as their first heavy metal band. Through different line-ups and band names they finally got a hold of the incredible talents of "The Dynamic Duo"; Sveinung "Candyman" Hjelle and Dan "The Man" Aasebø. The band has also gone under the names of Juicy Jane and Cobra. TJ Cobra is also the singer of Infernal Manes, Blofeld and Memorized Dreams. And he also writes and plays guitar for his girlfriend's band "Marita"

Violent Power are currently recording their first studio-album. It includes songs that were written as long as 20 years ago, and has a wide variety of themes; with everything from sci-fi to horror, fast and furious songs like "Awake / Asleep" and "Nosferatu", and also epic progressive songs like the 14 minute long "Commander Of The Forgotten Galaxy"
