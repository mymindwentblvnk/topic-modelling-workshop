BAUM is an LA-based pop singer-songwriter whose shimmering sound supports lyrics of youthfulness and freedom. 

There are 2 European Baums: 

1. Switzerland:
Baum is a singer from Switzerland. In May 2006 he acts as support of Van Morrison in Germany. With his guitar he creates a dense atmosphere and attracts the attention of the audience. 


2. Germany:
Baum was founded in 2008 by Johann Faustus (formerly Vox Diritatis) and Fleischart.
In the beginning they wanted to deal with the musical and yrical concepts, that didn't fit their 
mainprojects but nowadys the music is way more individual.
There are made side trips to old blues and hard rock, one gets lost inside the folkloristic 
undergrowth, follows the invitation of black metal and doesn't even stop before mucilaginous 
kitsch.

And in lyrical matters one also leaves the dowdy themes behind and avails oneself on wide
metaphors and ciphers. But nevertheless one still finds classical compositions in the lyrics.

In autumn 2008 their first demo was released.
The first album 'Panzertape' was released in summer 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Baum">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
