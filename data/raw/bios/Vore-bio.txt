VORE (Fayetteville, Arkansas) has been cranking out their unique blend of crushing, doom-laden death metal since 1994. The band draws upon death, doom, thrash and traditional metal influences to create an onslaught of brute power and heaviness. VORE's mid-paced rhythmic style is built around strong riffs and songcraft, rather than all out speed, which sets them apart from current trends in death metal. Over this soundscape, themes of doom, darkness, conquest and sorcery are laid down by two distinctly different vocalists, adding further flavor to the band's sound. The inclusion of acoustic instrumentals like Albion, Opaque and Ashes on their recordings shows VORE's diversity and spirit of experimentation.  

VORE presently consists of guitarist/vocalist Page Townsley, drummer Remy Cameron, and bassist Jeremy Partin. The band independently released four self-financed CDs â€“ Dead Kings Eyes in 1997, Lord of Storms in 2001, Maleficus in 2005, and their latest opus, Gravehammer, was unleashed in late 2011.  Vore is currently signed to AFM Records of Germany.  Website is at: http://www.vore.org <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
