Flatulated is a one man "DIY" death metal project. There are plans to release a few more albums although an attempt will be made to innovatively excel musically upon each release. The basic approach that was used was to take traditional songwriting and apply it to Death Metal. 

One man's idea of juvenile could be another man's idea of good songwriting. The songs DO NOT all sound the same like alot of other albums, but they do lack that "epic" feeling that is incorporated in Metal, generally speaking. There isn't any long winded musical introductions and as a matter of fact the music starts and we just jump right into things. No waiting around for that epic into or mid song passage to conclude.

All criticism will be taken into consideration on the future albums and a major effort to add more twists and turns in the song writing and storytelling will be made.

For now, we can only hope you enjoy this musical stepping stone. After all it is free you might as well listen to it a few times before you decide if it's something you like or not...
