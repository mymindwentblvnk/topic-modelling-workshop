Wangel is a Danish artist with Peter Wangel as the frontman.

Behind Peter Wangel stands the producer and co-composer Kasper Ejlerskov Leonhardt. 

Wangel draws inspiration from Peters own at times tumultuous life, which can be found everywhere throughout the lyrics and the melodies. From fragility and yearning, through the promiscuous and grandiose. These songs all mirror Peters external and internal challenges in life so far.

The first single from the EP is called ‘’Seoul’’. The primary source of inspiration for this particular song came from a trip to South Korea in the summer of 2014. Wangel was hired to play two gigs at Koreas biggest music festival Pentaport, and played in front of thousands of new fans. This was before anybody in Denmark had ever heard a word about Wangel.    

In the fall of 2014, Wangel also began to make a name for himself in Denmark, with radio appearances and support-jobs for fellow dane Kill J at sold out gigs in Aarhus and Copenhagen. In 2015, Wangel is ready to follow up the success of 2014 with the release of his first EP and shows booked at important festivals like Roskilde Festival and SPOT Festival.
