Colombian-Canadian singer-songwriter Jessie Reyez from Toronto whose unique take on pop music, accented with R&B and hip-hop influences, is reinforced by a raw vocal style that merges the deeply passionate with the stylishly theatrical. 

Reyez started singing at a young age. Inspired by her father's talent for playing acoustic guitar, and singing Colombian boleros, Jessie was destined to be a creative herself. It came naturally to Jessie, as she began writing lyrics and adopting her father's talents for the guitar. But before Reyez became serious about music, she was a committed student, and studied hip-hop dance from junior high into high school. However, after a traumatic breakup with her first serious boyfriend when she was 17, Jessie poured her heartache back into music. Reyez was then introduced to Chicago-based hip-hop artist King Louie. Soon, Reyez was approached to share her songwriting and vocal talents with such notables as Calvin Harris, Babyface, Chance the Rapper. Reyez was focused on building an audience for her own work however, and in April 2017, she released a seven-song EP, 'Kiddo', which includes tracks "Figures" and "Gatekeeper". Reyez followed EP with standalone "Phone Calls" and "Cotton Candy".

In March 2018, Reyez released a reprised version of "Figures" which was performed live alongside fellow Toronto-based artist Daniel Caesar at the Juno Awards. She recieved Breakthrough Artist of the Year, dedicating the win to Canadian artists.

Reyez, currently touring with singer-songwriter Halsey in North America, commemorated her recent success with a new single: "Apple Juice". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jessie+Reyez">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
