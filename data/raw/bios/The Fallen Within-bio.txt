The FALLEN WITHIN is an Athens based band, created in 2003 by the guitarist Gio S. The group belongs to the general style of metal influenced mainly by the American metalcore and Swedish melodic scene, having also experimental, progressive metal and many other elements like industrial and thrash ones.

For the moment we have completed our first full-length album which will be released in 2009! We want to mention some important collaborations like Bob Katsionis from FIREWIND on production and recordings which took part in Sound Symmetry Studio and of course Ahti Kortelainen who is the owner of the famous Tico Tico Studio in Finland and also responsible for the mix and mastering of the album.
