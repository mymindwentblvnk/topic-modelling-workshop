Dragonwind was formed in 2004 by the current members of Fireborn (Adam, Matt, Scott), and former members of Hatescar (Pat) and Herod (Nate) when Pat decided to start a new band.    He began looking for knowledgable and talented musicians and ended up getting together with friends in Fireborn to create some new music. With a good amount of material already written when they first got together, seven songs were quickly finished and perfected over the next several months. Pat had been handling vocal duties as well as guitar and decided that he wanted to focus just on guitar playing, so he got in touch with Nate to take over the screaming. In October of 2005 the full length "Kingdom of Flames" was recorded but never officially released. The Band immediatly started writing more music and in October of 2006 recorded their 2nd full length "Thrones Of Redemption". Their most recent full length "Beyond The Cold" was released on Feb 1, 2008.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dragonwind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
