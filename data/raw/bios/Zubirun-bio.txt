At the end of 1994, SHBS met his new suitable members. They are:
SBS
MABSM

The three of them are old friends, love the same music and can be said spiritually fit with SHBS. With this new line-up, Zubirun begin his quest.

Therefore in 1995 they managed to released ZUBIRUN's first demo entitled Ye Iblis Kingdom In The Aranyakas with the concept of 'Sado Dark Metal". In Y.I.K.I.T.A. they present 4 tracks based on Hinduism, Buddism & Ancient Malay. Anbe Muruga is the hit song in this demo, praise by many of their listener and gain attention from the local scene.
