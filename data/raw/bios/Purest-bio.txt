Purest was a German black metal band that formed in 2005. Only a single album was ever released (under the banner of Darker Than Black) entitled "Renascence" in January of 2008. The vinyl version of this sole album was released later the same year by Deviant Records. The band split up soon after, citing their reason as that they only wished to release one album and then terminate the project.

"Renascence" was recorded and mixed in 2007. The album was distributed by Merchant of Death and Abyss Records,. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Purest">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
