Nathicana is a Surrey/London based Death Metal Signed to Salute Records.

Formed in 2011, the band has seen a few lineup changes and a stronger pull towards Death Metal since their inception.

Though technically classed as an 'Old School' Death Metal band in a more 'Swedish' approach, Nathicana are varied in their sound, despite the obvious influences of classic Swedish Death Metal bands such as At The Gates and Entombed and the inclusion of the classic 'Buzzsaw' tone to the Guitars, though worth noting that Nathicana achieve their tone without using the seminal Boss HM-2 'Heavy Metal' pedal.
