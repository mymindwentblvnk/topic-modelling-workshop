Divertigo is a quest for idealistic expression in forms such as Metal, Rock, Ambient Jazz, Pop and New Age, favoring darker colours in its sonic appearance as well as bright.

DivertigO is a "one-man band" - the project of Steve, who does everything on the albums: he plays guitar, bass, drums, piano, horns, keyboards, and sings, as well as self-produces his music.

History in a paragraph:

1993 - 1996 saw a lot of cassette recordings of solo guitar work from DivertigO as well as music releases on the PC .mod scene. At the beginning of 1997, the "Primal Demo" cassette was released, containing styles ranging from Metal to New Age. The First CD, Integral was then released at the start of 1998, showcasing compositions with digital production and mastering for the first time as well as the addition of vocals. This was followed by several releases of new material in 1998-2000 on divertigo.com and mp3.com, resulting the "Human Chemicals" CD release through MP3.com in 2001.

In 2003, Divertigo returned with its most powerful work yet, "Gentle Chaos". All of the style elements of Divertigo are further vivified with this record. Each song maintains its own identity while contributing to the neural flow that is "Gentle Chaos".

In 2007, Divertigo will release "Assembly of Anxieties", a much different semi-concept record that pushes further into the cerebral realm, highlighting the purpose that Gentle Chaos had served. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Divertigo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
