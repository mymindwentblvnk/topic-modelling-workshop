Art of Deception was founded in 2012 and have since then released an EP, been playing shows around Norway and parts of eastern Europe and even won a music award. Their style is modern with an old school approach to writing heavy, melodic riffs. With this combination you get an undefined sound, and the band keep it interesting through progressive songwriting.
