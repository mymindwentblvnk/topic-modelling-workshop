Conceived in the summer of 2008, Decades Of Deception resides in Philadelphia, PA. Formed from ex-members of A Well Thought Tragedy, and When Man Meets His Maker, along with new additons, this band does not intend on upsetting it's audience. Derived from fast riffs, intense breakdowns, precise percussion, mind-boggling vocals and rediculous live show, Decades of Deception is already being compared to the likes of such bands as Whitechapel, August Burns Red, The Acacia Strain and many others. They plan to release their 8 song EP entitled "Imperium" this February 2010. In the midst of a falling out within the band in May of 2009 and a 6 month absence, they're now back and ready to continue playing as many shows as they can.  They broke up in in 2010.

In 2020 they reunited and released their new single Contagion Invasion. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Decades+Of+Deception">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
