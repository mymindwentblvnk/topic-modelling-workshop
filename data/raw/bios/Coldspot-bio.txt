In Januar 2009 (Bonn, Germany) Christian, Danny and Martin decided to leave former diseases, to focus on and to push their own and new energetic metal band! Later Bernd entered on guitar.
German and English, clean vocals and growls, pushing rhythm and melodic guitar riffs result in Coldspots own energetic metal sound!

In June 2009 the band recorded the first material for their debut album
