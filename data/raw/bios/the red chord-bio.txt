Since its formation, The Red Chord has released four studio albums, toured in North America, Europe, Japan and eventually became a pioneering band of the "deathcore" genre.

The majority of The Red Chord's music is written by McKenzie and to a lesser degree by Weeks. The band's "grindcore style of death metal" or "death/grind" incorporates also elements of metalcore and hardcore punk and is typically experimental. The band helped popularize the "deathcore" genre. The Red Chord typically uses frequent tempo changes, technically proficient instrumental approach and emphasizes the element of groove in their music. The vocal style of Kozowyk combines death metal's guttural growl with metalcore-style screaming, uses occasional spoken word and is rather decipherable. As a vocal influence, Kozowyk points out Frank Mullen from Suffocation; Black Sabbath as one of his musical influences and Faith No More as a lyrical inspiration. PopMatters states that "The Red Chord has become renowned for its sense of humor" exemplified by the video "Stache Attack".
