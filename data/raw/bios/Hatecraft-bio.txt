Hatecraft band was formed in September of 2001 by Alexander "Stepan" Stepashkin (bass, vocal), Alexander Kharavin (guitar) and Victor (drums). In November of 2001 the musicians got their 1st studio experience recording their 3 song demo. After that Victor Drujinin left Hatecraft and his place at the drums took up Boris "HyperBoryan" Oreshkin. Inspired by the new drummer the band activated preparing the concert program and material for record. By this time Hatecraft got a huge creative & material support from their new friend Uri Klochkov who began "an engine" of the band. In the February of 2002 studio record of 5-song 24-minute demo "Rebellious Heart" began. The work lasted till the beginning of April. During the record Edward Yohim (guitar) & Alexey Tkachov joined the band. In July 2002 Edward Yohim had to leave the band, but Hatecraft found his substitute very quickly - Dmitry Volkov began the second guitarist. Soon the band changed the drummer - Pavel Sokolov came in Hatecraft. So the line-up became
Alexander Stepashkin (bass, vocal)
Alexander Kharavin (guitar)
Alexey Tkachov (keyboards)
Pavel Sokolov (drums)
Dmitry Volkov (guitar)
In May of 2003 the record of debut album was started, but it lasts till the end of April of 2004 due to circumstances beyond the band's control. In May Hatecraft signed a contract with one of the most huge music labels in Russia CD-Maximum. The CD was released in the beginning of September. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hatecraft">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
