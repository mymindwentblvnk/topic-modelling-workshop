Tic Tac Toe is an all-female German hip-hop group comprised of Ricarda WÃ¤ltken, Marlene Tackenberg  and Liane Wiegelmann. Having sold over 3 Million Albums, they are the most successful German language rap group to date. Formed in 1995, they released their self-titled debut album in 1996. Their second album, Klappe Die 2te, was released the following year. After a successful first few years, the group split due to personal difficulties. Currently signed to Sony BMG (Germany), Tic Tac Toe attempted a return to the spotlight with the 2005 comeback single "Spiegel". This song has been very successful, receiving airplay in German speaking countries and being featured often on German VIVA, VIVA Plus and MTV. In 2007 they split up again.

Tic Tac Toe was also the name of a UK dance label that produced some of the first jungle / drum'n bass records in 1992. The first release was in April 1992 and consisted of "456" and "Ephemerol". Ephemerol was remixed in August by Mickey Finn, Fabio and Grooverider. Subsequent releases by Tic Tac Toe included Sunshine in Oct 1992 (inspiration for Fat Boy Slim's Trippin on Sunshine) and the Big Blue in 1993. Point to note - the producer behind Tic Tac Toe was Simon Ratcliffe, who is now one half of Basement Jaxx. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tic+Tac+Toe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
