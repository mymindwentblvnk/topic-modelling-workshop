From Euphoric's Myspace:

"we reach out to all suburbans, urbans, women, children, elders, people of different races, different religions, people who are outcasts, people who are popular, nerds, geeks, jocks, people with disabilities, deaf people, blind people, people with no tongues, and basic individuals who will listen. we do not reach out to people who discriminate against other people because of anything besides a terrible personality. we want to persue music with our creative intuition. listening to our music takes time; there is a sinking in factor that is unsettling at first. it will become better with practice. talk to us, share ideas with us, let's collaborate. thank you for giving us a chance." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Euphoric">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
