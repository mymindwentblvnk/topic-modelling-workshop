In 1999 Second Silence came together. After getting known because of their concerts and their demo (produced by Luis Trraga, Hamlet) they started recording their first LP Apocalipsys in Extrema, counting again with the production of Luis Trraga. They have been playing with amazing groups like Soziedad Alkoholika and presented their fisrt album touring with Habeas Corpus. Their LP as well as their concerts are having very positive and satisfying critics from press and people. Second Silence turns form a garage group to be a referent group inside the most aggressive Metal scene in Spain. After braking with their first record company and signing with Fucking Records, Second Silence begins to tape their second lp, Inmisericorde, produced by Haritz Harreguy and mastered in the best known studios of West West Side Music in USA. Aggressive, direct, forceful and violent metal do forme the new album INMISERICORDE.
