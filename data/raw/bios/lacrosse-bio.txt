Lacrosse is the national game of Canada. It is also the hometown of serial killer Ed Gein. But above all, Lacrosse is five boys and one girl making fantastic pop music. From a basement in Stockholm, Lacrosse brings you love and happiness in songs so catchy that you can't help singing along!  With a lot of energy, two intense lead vocalists, incredibly sweet guitar melodies and blazing drum beats, Lacrosse is the musical equivalent of endless summer nights when the world is young and beautiful and everything seems possible. The band was formed in 2005 and they released their debut album This New Year Will Be For You And Me in 2007. Their second album Bandages for the Heart was released two years later, in 2009. Two songs of Lacrosse can be heard in Daniel Espinosa's feature film "Outside Love".  Their song You Can’t Say No Forever is featured in Estrella Damm's 2012 summer ad. Estrella Damm is a locally well-known catalan brewery that has already catapulted independent bands in previous years.
