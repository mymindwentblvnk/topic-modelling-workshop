2.  Winter Solstice are a four piece indie-folk band hailing from Brisbane, Australia. Ari, Rosie, Kez and Joy met while studying and came together to form Winter Solstice, each bringing their own varied tastes in musical genres including folk, classical, jazz, pop, metal, etc. to the melting pot to create the rich harmonies, complex melodies and infectious rhythms that is their sound. They released their first EP in late 2010, followed by steady gigging in Brisbane and its surrounds. They are currently working on a second EP. Read more: http://www.facebook.com/wintersolsticeband
