The Ophidian ascension formed in 2008 via some mutual friends. After a couple of early line up changes the complete current band has been the same since the first show in 2009. Quickly developing a presence in the melbourne metal scene and playing regularly 'toa' gained the reputation of being one of the heaviest original australian blackend death metal bands in the scene. Playing along side the likes of 'in the burial' 'orphans of the sky' 'state of east london' 'sun tzu' 'the mung' and 'Jack The Stripper' TOA Are known for brutal stage presence and travelling the k's to play. Our debut EP release is planned to be complete before the year is out along side a supporting national tour and film clip. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Ophidian+Ascension">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
