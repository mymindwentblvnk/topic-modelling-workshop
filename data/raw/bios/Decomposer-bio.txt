Born and raised in Atlanta Georgia, Riyad Taher (The Decomposer) is pushing the boundaries of genres as far as they can go.  Currently doing solo projects as "Decomposer" and heading the group "Sundays Hangover", his music reflects a unification of all things pleasing to the ear.  

Decomposer started rapping at the age of 13 and was producing by 16, but "I didn't fully understand what music was until the age of 21".  Thats when he taught himself to read music and play piano.  "I didn't know anything about chords and scales before that.  I would just randomly play keys until I found something I liked. That method is highly inefficient, so I could only make one or two songs a week.  I needed to do better, and I wanted to feel like a true musician, so I decided to play an instrument.  I bought a piano book that same day and read it from cover to cover.  When I learned music theory I was able to produce, write and record two songs in a day."

Being a disciplined musician hasn't taken anything away from his creativity however.  He Is still able to bounce from genre to genre and invent music that forces us to add new chapters to the music theory guidelines, but hey, guess thats why they call it music theory and not music law.   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Decomposer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
