1) Old Forest are a self-acclaimed 'cult black metal' band formed in 1998, with mastermind James 'Kobold' Fogarty (Ewigkeit, The Meads of Asphodel and Jaldaboath) firmly situated behind it. So far 2 full-length albums, 1 compilation and 2 EPs have been released, in addition to 3 demos. Their highly praised track "Curse of Thundermoon" also appeared on the "Britannia Infernus - A History of British Occult and Black Metal" compilation, along with such acts; Anaal Nathrakh, Thus Defiled, Cradle of Filth, Hecate Enthroned and The Meads of Asphodel.

The name 'Old Forest' derives from J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, the Old Forest is a small forested area which lies east of the Shire in Buckland. The music is inspired by the early 90's Norwegian black metal bands, and mostly resembles that of early Emperor, Darkthrone, Burzum and Forgotten Woods.
