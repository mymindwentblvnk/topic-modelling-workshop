Putrid Blood was formed in the beginning of 2008, by Srdjan Ranisavljevic (guitar) and Slobodan Stanic (bass), with tendency to play thrash metal . Shortly after that, Slobodan leaves the band and Srdjan Hardi takes his place. 
For more than a year, the band existed only as a project and first versions of the band songs originate from that period. During the work on the material, few more people were interested in the project. Petar Barna (drums), Bojan Goluza (vocals) and Stevan Milankovic (vocals) joined the band. 

After a few rehearsals, new members contributed to the band’s sound, which is based on thrash metal, with elements of hardcore and black metal. The songs got their final shape. Putrid Blood held its first gig on “Sid cultural summer” festival, alongside Awaiting Fear, Ashen Epitaph, Salted Cut and Morbidoom. After a very good reaction from the crowd to the played material, the band decided to continue with the work and recorded its first demo, titled “Fire At Will”. The demo contains seven songs and it was recorded at the “Piknik” studio in Novi Sad, in September and October of 2009.

.
            In August 2012, the band entered one of the best studios in Serbia, called
“Blaze” in Belgrade and recorded its first full-length album titled “Absolute Profit”, which contains 10 songs – 5 in Serbian, 4 in English language and one instrumental. It was officialy released via Miner Recordings from Switzerland in November 2012.

           Two years later, in September 2014, Putrid Blood goes back to studio "Blaze" and records three new songs. Mašinerija, Vođa and Odmazda will be publicly presented on Putrid Blood's official Youtube channel.
