The Devil Makes Three is an Americana band from Santa Cruz, California, United States. The group blends bluegrass, old time, country, folk, blues, jazz, and ragtime music. The group's members are guitarist Pete Bernhard, upright bassist Lucia Turino, and guitarist and tenor banjo player Cooper McBean.

â€œThe rhythm is what our band is about." Says Pete Bernhard: Guitarist, Front Man. The Devil Makes Three are quite possibly the best band that you have never heard of. They have been constantly on tour, selling out dates across the country and in their neck of the woods on the West Coast drawing near capacity crowds nightly. This is all word of mouth. Over the years, the Devil Makes Three have garnered fans the old school way, playing a city, making friends, conquering fans and moving on.

Laced with elements of ragtime, blues, country, folk and rockabilly, the critically praised, drummer-less trio - consisting of Vermont native, guitarist/front man Pete Bernhard, stand-up bassist Lucia Turino and guitarist Cooper McBean, also of rural Vermont - brings forth a genuine approach to acoustic music.  The sound is deeply steeped in rhythm and alive with three part harmonies, while keeping a slightly punk aesthetic to their music and especially their live shows.

Note: the following songs belong to a different band with the same name, a small local metal band from Northern Ireland:
