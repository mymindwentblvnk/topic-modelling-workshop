2562 is Dave Huismans. This project is characterized by a post-garage skippiness, with rolling bass and hyper-edited snares learned from broken beat, a sense of space and echo learned from dub, and a devastating 4x4 anchorage and attention to detail from techno old and new. The result is more than the sum of its parts, an incredibly fulsome yet lean, natural-sounding, dancefloor-wrecking hybrid that has found favor not only among dubstep heads but anyone drawn to fresh and innovative club music.

Huismans has also made some rather kick-ass tunes under the name Dogdaze. That project is now retired, but he continues to turn out incredible deep house and techno confections under the name A Made Up Sound.
