Forbidden Site was a French gothic black metal from Grenoble, formed in 1993 and disbanded in 2003.
They released their first demo, "Renaissances Noires" in 1996. It didn't take long to this aristocratic/dandy-like group to become cult as soon as they gave birth to their first real album "Sturm und Drang", in 1997. Their last album, "Astralgeist" was released in 1999.
The music they play is kind of hard to describe, because they borrow elements from black metal and gothic metal in order to create a very personal sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Forbidden+Site">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
