Collective based in Prague, Czech republic, trying to mash up analog grindcore/metal groove with electro/breakcore stuff. Former industrial/experimental/death band with some noise/samples experiments, since 1994 [built on remains of czech industrial pioneer legend “střední evropa”, we have supported mighty CARCASS in february 94], now reinforced with a breakcore/hardcore/weirdo liveset. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/M.A.C.+Of+Mad">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
