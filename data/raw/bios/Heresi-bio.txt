Heresi is a one-man orthodox Black Metal band from Sweden featuring lyrical themes dealing with satanism and hatred for Christianity.

Composed, written and recorded by the sole member: Skamfer.
Skamfer was also one of the founding members of Ondskapt, and it is to be noted that he also came up with the name. Due to mental health issues (depression), he was admitted to a hospital, which rendered him incapable of recording any material with Ondskapt. 
Forming around 2000, the band is currently signed to Total Holocaust Records.
