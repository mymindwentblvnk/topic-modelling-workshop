One of the earliest death/thrash metal bands from Brazil, they were formed in 1984 in São José dos Campos, São Paulo, splitting-up and reforming the same year. In 1986 they released their first demo, followed by a live recording named "Live at Black Devastation Festival" the next year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tharithimas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
