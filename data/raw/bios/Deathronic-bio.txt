Deathronic  is a One-Man Symphonic Black Death Metal Project From  Paris  Created by   Amine Andalous O.

Deathronic is experimenting Symphonic Black Death Metal, combining several influences such as electronic music, oriental, doom and old school heavy metal!
In late 2011 Deathronic entered The Parlours Studios, in Kettering UK and began recording his first mini album, Duality Chaos with Neil Haynes as engineer. The vocals were recorded in March 2012 at the Audio Sound Art Studio in Berlin and engineered by Laurentx Etxemendi (Gojira etc.).
"Duality Chaos" was mixed & mastered in April 2012 by Fredrik Nordstr√∂m and Henrik Udd at Studio Fredman (Dimmu Borgir, At the Gates, Opeth, In Flames, etc.) - the famous Gothenburg Sound! The main concept behind Duality Chaos is human violence, a theme which is very present both in the lyrics and on the album's artwork.

"...The idea is to denounce how human are, still today, bestial beings. The contemporary bloody conflicts are a perfect example of this. Mankind continues to kill for irrational reasons. In this sense, real progress, real evolution is not measured by our technological innovations, but progress in acquiring wisdom, "Progress of mind". I think that the origin of that violence is the internal duality of human beings (the struggle between Good and Evil). Many of the worst atrocities are perpetrated in the name of subjective notions of good or bad? A duality that gives birth to chaos..."
