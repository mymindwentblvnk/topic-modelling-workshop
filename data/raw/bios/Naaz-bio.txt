Naaz Mohammad (born Gorinchem, The Netherlands, 8 June 1998), known professionally as Naaz, is a Dutch-Kurdish indie pop singer.  Born in Gorinchem, Naaz and her family moved to Rotterdam when she was two. Her parents fled Iraq during the Gulf War; Naaz's father is a doctor, and her mother is his assistant. 

Naaz was bullied at school but found comfort in the words of one of her teachers. A car accident in which her parents were wounded was a turning point in her life and that of her parents: music had been a 'no-go', but after the accident the family was more open and accepting of their daughter's ambitions.

As a singer, Naaz initially gained media attention as a participant in the Holland's Got Talent TV show in 2014, but her independent career in electronic indie pop seriously took off in 2016 when she started to release singles on Spotify. 'Sadboy' (2016) was the first, although Naaz herself feels that the song was "just a sketch". She considers 'Words' (2017) to be her proper d√©but song.

Naaz released a string of singles and two EPs: Bits of Naaz (2018) and The Beautiful Struggle (2019). 

She disappeared from the spotlights for a year or two, battled some demons and returned in 2022, a woman rather than a girl, with the single 'Sad Violins'. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Naaz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
