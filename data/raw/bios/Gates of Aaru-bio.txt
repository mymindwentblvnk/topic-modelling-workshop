Founded in 2012 by Sean Hendry, Gates Of Aaru started as a solo project which saw itself expand to include multiple members throughout the years before settling on a final lineup. Allen Purkiss was amongst the first to join and shredded his way onto the first album entitled 'In Retribution Of Life & Decay'. Apart from being an irreplaceable song-writer, Allen lent himself to produce & mix this album later on as well.

GoA was then joined by Leon (drums) & Charl (guitar) Kemp, brothers whose destructive power was heard on stage when GoA laid down a law for the first time in South Africa.

As of 2016, GoA are currently busy with the production of their first full-length album. Keep your eyes and ears tuned!
