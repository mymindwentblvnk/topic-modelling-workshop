NORZ FEUER was born of a collaboration between several members of the Violent Solutions forum.

During the evening of the second Rendez-Vous VS, Trauerbrandung and Entomber, alcohol helping, decided to realize a Black Metal project.

Trauerbrandung itself mit to compose from words to even the tablecloth of the restaurant and Entomber will take care of the music later.
This one tell Yann to come to hold the vocals and to Evil Lustus to realize the album artwork.

This collaboration gave birth to the 7 titles component the "Pure evil substance" album that you will be able free to download.

To this day, an after the "Pure evil substance" album is possible... the future will say us if she become real.
