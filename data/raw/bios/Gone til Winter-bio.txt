UK Dark Melodic Power Metal

Following a couple of embryonic years which saw a number of line-up changes and early demo recordings the band stepped up a gear in 2007.

Demo EP 'Deconstruct The Season' received airplay across the UK, France and Belgium from stations such as BBC Radio 6/Bruce Dickinson, BBC Radio Lancashire, Silk FM, Aligre FM, Radio Metal, European Klassik Rock, Rock Radio Manchester and Overdrive/Radio Aktief as-well as positive reviews from Rocksound magazine and countless fanzines and online publications across Europe.

With their brand of melodic, progressive, gothic tinged power metal beginning to spread across the underground, the band continued their momentum into 2008 maintaining a busy gigging schedule which saw hometown support slots with I-DEF-I, Forever Never and Blaze Bayley after which the band signed a deal with independent UK based label Headroom Records.

Gone Til Winter's debut single 'Hear Me' was released on May 11th 2009 in the UK with a self titled mini album following in the September. After getting back in the studio to record some acoustic tracks, Gone Til Winter released an album full of rare material in December 2011.

Gone Til Winter are set to tour the UK & release their new album "Hiding From The Sun" Summer 2012!
