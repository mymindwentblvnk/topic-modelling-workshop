Folkedudl was born 2001. The idea was to make folk-metal combined with saxophone. This turned out to be quite nice. The project was soon turned into a full band.
In 2004 they released the debut-album "Die Boten Des KÃ¶nigs". But after this it became quiet around Folkedudle. In 2006 they broke up, due to time problems for practicing, since all band members started to study in different cities.
