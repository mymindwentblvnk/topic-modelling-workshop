The name Klamm (German for “ravine“) stands for the artistic concept of the band. A typical piece starts out on a calm, peaceful surface. From there on it digs deeper and ever deeper, the tone gets louder, harsher and more hostile.

KLAMM don’t just make barrages of simple verse-chorus constructs. Each idea gets the time it needs to unfold, no matter if a few minutes suffice or if it takes even more than 10 minutes.

Originating in black metal, the music is intermitted by silent, melodic and experimental moments – vehemence strikes after the calm! The German lyrics reflect abstract personal experiences and thoughts which blend into the musical mix in the form of screams, sung or whispered parts.
KLAMM is: Simon (drums, music, concept, lyrics), Wolfgang (vocals, lyrics), Peter (guitar), Christian (guitar), Andreas (bass)

In summer 2008 the band's first demo called Frostfluss was released (distribution through the band).
The next album was released in 2012 and is called Wahnsee. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Klamm">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
