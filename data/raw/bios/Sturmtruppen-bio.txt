There are two bands named Sturmtruppen:

1) Sturmtruppen was a Black Metal band from Germany (Übach-Palenberg, North Rhine-Westphalia).  Formed in 1996.

Sturmtruppen changed their name into Truppensturm  before releasing the self titled 2006 Vinyl EP. The reason of the name-change was that there is another German-speaking band with the same name that formed almost a decade earlier.

2) Sturmtruppen was a Swiss RAC band from Basel that formed in 1988. They released the album "Es ist Zeit" (misspelled "Es ist Beit") on Rebelles Européens in 1990. Sturmtruppen presumably broke up shortly after its release, and the only other official release from the band is the discography compilation "The Best of Sturmtruppen" released by NS Records.

Line-up:
Patrick - Vocals, Guitar
David - Bass
Michael - Drums

Not to be confused with the similarly named Sturmtruppen Skinheads from Reinach that formed in 1994. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sturmtruppen">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
