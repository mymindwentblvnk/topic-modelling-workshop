Thrash metal from Greece in the vain of Anthrax, Vio-lence and Nuclear Assault.

We are a thrash metal band from Thessaloniki, Greece, formed in 2009. We recorded 2 demos in 2011 and we self-released our debut album called "Shit Into Existence" in 2014.

Fast and groovy thrash speaking about everyday problems that nobody gives a crap about.
