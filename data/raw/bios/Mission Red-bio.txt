In 1999 Nate Morris and Brandon Blair began playing music together while in still in High School. In 2001 they were joined by friend Dorian Lamb on bass, and performed around Dallas as Fifth Ticket Fraud. By 2003 the band had dissolved as the members devoted time to their personal lives - Blair left Texas, Morris started his own company, and Lamb continued to play music locally for a period before focusing on his career. Seven years passed quietly. 2009 saw Blair return to his home state, and by early 2010 the trio had begun writing and recording new material. The members of Mission Red shared the stage for the first time in years during the summer of 2010, and continue to perform in the North Texas area. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mission+Red">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
