Born in mid-September 2010, Dissonance In Majesty plays a singular style of Blackened Death metal, tinged with metalcore and overlaid with a rich, melodic canopy of lush orchestral arrangements. The music is as likely to pummel you with ferocious blastbeats and savage breakdowns as it is to uplift you with soaring string harmonies and melodic riffing.

New Disorder is part one of a continuing chronicle, with this segment detailing a man's struggles against a malevolent, omnipresent religious theocracy. 

Listen, enjoy, and stick around for the long haul. Dissonance in Majesty is only getting started. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dissonance+In+Majesty">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
