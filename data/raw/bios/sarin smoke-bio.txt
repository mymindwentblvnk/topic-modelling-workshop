A stirring and meditative dual guitar duo of Tom Carter (Charalambides) and Peter Swanson (Yellow Swans). Not what you would expect but exactly what you are in need of - a deeply soul-stirring sound of electric guitars. Great album art by Liz Harris (Grouper). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sarin+Smoke">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
