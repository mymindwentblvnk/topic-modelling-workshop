On the rare chance that you've dreamed about a supergroup consisting of Talk Talk's Mark Hollis, Thom Yorke and Rob Dickinson of Catherine Wheel, they'd most likely sound like Aveo -- Seattle's post-rock/experimental trio. Aveo's sophomore effort, Battery doesn't drift too far from their hometown's lush scenery, but it isn't your conventional cloudburst of emotion. A stormy aura is draped throughout songs such as the psychological lessons of "Newton and Galileo" and "Desert and the Great Divorce." "Dust That Dreams of Brooms" and "Hypochondria is Spreading" brim with similar appeal, but with a richer post-punk elixir. Adding to the slick polish of Battery is vocalist William Wilson's boyish hush. Wilson is a crooner provocateur, Paul Weller-style, compared to his fey efforts on Aveo's debut Bridge to the Northern Lights. Only can bittersweet pop moments equal the sheer pop splendor that is Aveo's Battery."  (RollingStone.com)
