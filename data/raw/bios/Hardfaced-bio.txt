Hardfaced was formed in the beginning of 2004 in Ohrid, Macedonia. Six friends influenced by different music styles such as hardcore, metal, punk and hip hop created original and recognizable hardcore/metal sound. Through 2007, with the following line up: Dime – vocals, Klimo – vocals, Goran – guitars, Jovan – guitars, Igor – bass and Bojan – drums, they recorded and self-released their debut full-length album called “More than hate”. The album got great reviews on Macedonian and Balkan underground scene and was completely sold out. The same year album was re-released in Bulgaria through “Years of Pain records”,followed by few performances in Bulgaria and Serbia. The song “Hope” appeared on the Balkan hardcore compilation released in Serbia by Fight For. The album was promoted in almost every city in Macedonia. In 2008, right before entering the studio to record their second full-length album, Bojan left the band. Jordan took his place and brought new fresh blood and strength in the band. Finally in 2009 they entered “Krecho Sound Studio” and completely recorded second full-length album called “Show them what they fear”, which will be released in the middle of 2010.
