The Bloody Irish Boys are best described as a drinking group with a music problem. The band was started by front man Shayne in 2003 and they are a hard drinking, working band still going strong today. They strive to preserve the sound of their roots and pay tribute to the bands before them. This was evident when they released their first album Drunk Rock in 2005 which featured many original songs mixing traditional Celtic, bluegrass, punk, and metal. They have created a very unique intense sound that people describe as more folk than most modern music and more punk than most popular music. Now they are at it again with the release of their most recent album Auld St. Patrick on St. Patrick's Day 2011. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Bloody+Irish+Boys">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
