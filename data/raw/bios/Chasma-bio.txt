Chasma is an American black metal band whose style is described as seeking "transcendence through ragged fury, shape-shifting dynamics, and frequently beautiful excursions, recasting classic black metal into otherworldly shapes and a plausibly modern contour" and as being "mystical yet emotional, of the earth and yet aiming for the cosmos".

Based in Portland, OR.
