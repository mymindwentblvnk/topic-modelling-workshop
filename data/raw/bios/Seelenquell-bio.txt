Seelenquell is a newcomer band from Dresden, Germany which, as they state themself, make melodic gothic metal.

Their songs are dominated by the voice of the singer and the finer guitar lines of their lead guitarist. Also the dark lyrics which often describe feelings of hurt and anger are an important element.
