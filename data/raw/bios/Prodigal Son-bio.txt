2) Prodigal Son are a progressive metal quintet from Scotland, UK. Formed in 2005 they built their sound around each members musical aspiration. All though all five were mainly into metal, their preference in sub-genres created a vast array of sounds to experiment with.  As a result, their sound is an amalgam of most sub-genres of modern metal. They draw from  Prog, Groove, Death, Grindcore,and occasionally Gothenburg, Industrial & Power metal. However, utilising more than one at most times, they manage to avoid clich√©s of these sub-genres and create a sound that is epic but not cheesy, aggressive without sounding stupid and maintains a certain Groove.

Their songs are mostly progressive with a few exceptions. The songs are not necessarily long and drawn out; they are able to take the complexity of a progressive song and compact it into spaces as small as three minutes. Their songs were originally played only in dropped C tuning but in 2006 they introduced the Seven-String to their sound which allowed for more expression and a lynching tone. They have more dominant bass parts than a lot of metal acts around today and the drums bring a bit more in terms of creativity. In short, Prodigal son are filtering out the mundane whilst keeping that which truly rocks.
