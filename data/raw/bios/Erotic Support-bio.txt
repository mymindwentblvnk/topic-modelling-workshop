Erotic Support, or ErSu as they're known to enemies, has existed in its current form since 2001, though the guys have played together in bands since the 90s.

Through the years, the band have evolved from post-punk rock to stoner metal, the first demo from 2003 exhibiting the former and the second and soon to be released third efforts the latter.

In conjunction with the release of the third EP in 11/2006, the band changed their name to the Swords of Mars, feeling that the old name did not fully reflect the band's musical direction anymore.

Line-up:
Ville - vocals & guitar
Tero - guitar
Mikko - bass
Jussi - drums
