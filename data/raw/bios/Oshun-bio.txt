OSHUN is a Iya-sol (Neo-Soul/Hip-Hop) duo comprised of DMV natives Niambi Sala and Thandiwe, both 19. Their sisterhood was manifested in March 2013 when the two met as incoming freshmen at a scholarship orientation at NYU. After an instant connection, OSHUN made their debut at the orientation’s talent showcase in 2014.

Niambi Sala has been a vocalist and musician her entire life and was raised in a musical home. She moved to NYC to continue her career as a student at the Clive Davis Institute at NYU. Thandiwe came to NYU to study Journalism and Africana Studies. During her initial time in NYC, she dabbled in music production. At the end of their first semester, Thandi and Niambi decided to pursue their collaboration seriously.

The name OSHUN is homage to a Yoruba river deity (Osun) and her sisters (Yemoja and Oya) who all represent elements of femininity and womanhood. Since their debut EP “AFAHYE” in March of 2014, OSHUN has amassed a fan base of over 10,000. OSHUN has gained attention from numerous publications, including Complex, Huffington Post, Okayplayer, Afropunk, Deli Magazine, Impose Magazine, Nu-Soul Mag and more, and have over 120K plays on SoundCloud, and 80K views on YouTube. OSHUN toured throughout the greater NYC area in 2014, and performed in major cities such as their home city Washington, DC and Philadelphia. “ASASE YAA” is their debut mixtape and was released to celebrate Earth Day.

Their goal is to share Oshun/JAH/LOVE/LIGHT ‘s peaceful omnipresence for the bigger purpose of empowering women, and all people, instilling confidence, cultural pride, and self-respect. This bigger purpose is within a re-emerging movement of cultural realignment, awareness, and creativity.
