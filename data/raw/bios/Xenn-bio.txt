Some time after Polish band ABRAXAS dissolved in 2000, Luq Swiech (guitars, synths, programming) decided to form a new project, with Maciej Bagin (bass, vocals, percussion) and Rafal Ratajczak (Chapman stick) - all with a background from ABRAXAS - joining the project, and Jurek Rogiewicz (drums, percussion) as the final member.

The recording of the album took place in Xenn studios from 2002-03; hence the name of the band; and in March 2003 the album "Offworld" was released.

Main member Luq Swiech moved to USA shortly after the release of the album, effectively dissolving the band, leaving their sole album as their legacy. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Xenn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
