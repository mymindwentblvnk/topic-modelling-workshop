There are a couple of bands called Lubricant:

1. Together with Purtenance and Convulse, Lubricant were the death metal scene of Nokia, Finland. Influenced by Xysma they called themselves O.V.D. before starting to play death metal with a rock 'n' roll sound under the new name Lubricant. They formed in 1991, recorded a demo in November same year and then signed a deal and released one album through the German label Morbid Records before splitting up. They played live shows in support of bands like Sentenced, At The Gates and Enslaved. After having split up several members went on to form the new band All Stars.

2. Kickass hardcore punk band from Singapore. https://lubricant.bandcamp.com/ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lubricant">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
