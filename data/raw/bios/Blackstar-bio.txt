The group:
Blackstar was formed after the demise of Carcass, with their one album, Barbed Wire Soul, continuing in the vein of Carcass' Swansong (i.e. away from the grindcore of that band's early works). In some areas the album has been released under the band name Blackstar Rising, presumably for legal reasons and apparently without the knowledge of the band itself (versions of the album can be found under both names). Drummer Ken Owen fell victim to a brain hemorrhage during recordings for a second album, and with him unable to continue, the band folded. Owen has since been reported as getting better.

The rapper:
Blackstar used to be a member of the underground rap group "The Pretty Young Pimps" or "PYP" with Popcorn from the Lower East Side, NYC.  He is now branching off and organizing his own Label.

Blackstar is also a jungle crew with varied members of congo natty led by rebel mc <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blackstar">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
