Leipzig, November 2011 
While the onset of winter approaches, DeZafra Ridge make their debut with a four-track EP: a gloomy composition of down-tempo sludge strokes, rolling guitar riffs and expansive melodies, overlaid with strong shouting vocals.
The five-piece band from Leipzig, Germany, creates in this release a dark, cold atmosphere of both stillstand and progress, slicing heavy fog while delving into spiritual abyss. Inspired by ancient Mythology and contemporary culture as well as personal experience and introspection, the music accompanies the lyrics by a [homogeneous] fusion of different [varieties of] metal genres, in a monotonous, hypnotic manner.
The release splits into hardware record on tape and digital download. The Tape comes in a carton slipcase sealed with black wax and is limited to 100 copies. It contains two tracks, each of round about ten minutes length. Additional download codes for two more tracks are included. The EP is also available in digital format via bandcamp. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DeZafra+Ridge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
