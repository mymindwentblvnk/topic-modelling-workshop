Austrian anti-fascist Black Metal/Punk/Speed Metal band from Krems, Lower Austria.

Formed in 2003 with an original line-up of Nïtro (N.) on vocals and guitars and D. on drums. They recorded a demo in the very same year ("Forgotten Grimness Returns"). The music was heavy influenced by early 90's black metal, especially the Norwegian/Scandinavian sound.

Demonstorm Azahel and Sethnacht alternately completed Ewig Frost's live line-Up.

In 2007 the first album "Blue Septime Winters" was released by Ashen Productions, in which the bass-tracks were done by Nïtro.

Füel (F.) joined the band in 2006, he is a blues-guitarist playing bass for Ewig Frost. The music evolved, the band drew new inspiration from 80's hardcore punk (D-beat, crust, japcore), thrash and speed metal, rock 'n' roll and the first wave of black metal.

In December 2009 the EP "Rust" was released by Noise Of Dissent Records in cooperation with Ashen Productions.

D. decided to leave the band in 2011. A few weeks later, in September 2011, Doom gave Ewig Frost a shot, and his drumming finally completed Ewig Frost's unholy trinity. The names changed from N. to Nïtro and from F. to Füel.

Line-up:
Nïtro - vocals/guitars
