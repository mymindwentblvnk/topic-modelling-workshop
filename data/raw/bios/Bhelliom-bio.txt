Formed in mid 2000, Bhelliom set about constructing heavy groove-driven Melodic death metal with a touch of Stoner/Thrash metal that would not only set them a part of from other homegrown metal bands but also gain the interest from metal critics abroad

“Bhelliom’s style is a striking and refreshing counterpoint to the stale, shitty melodic death seeping out of garages across the United States and elsewhere”- Metal Review

Their debut album (Self-release). ‘Within Nowhere’, released in Sept 2005, paved the way forward for Bhelliom. The album opens the door for Bhelliom to enter Asia, invited to be part of Thailand oldest metal fest and to performing at one of Asia biggest music festival, Formoz music fest in Taiwan, had helped establish the group with a solid and loyal fanbase and those who saw them have witness a raise of new Asia Thrash/ Melodic Death metal band.

In 2007, the band will celebrate its 7th years of existence, with a release of a brand new album (to be release in 3RD quarter of 2007). Bhelliom has also prove that even without a major label backing and not following trend, they are making ground on their own, and now with more tours in Asia and possible further, Bhelliom are working harder than before for the recognition and for the people who believe and supported them since day one
