Crain was at the forefront of Louisville's noise/indie scene and recieved a bit of attention nationwide (although not as much as say, Rodan) partially due to recording with people such as Steve Albini in Chicago. But with that said, it's not to slight several phenomenal records that the band put under it's belt, most notably the rare (until the recent reissue) Speed and the Heater album.

The name "Crain" was reportedly a nod towards some of the members previous band (Cerebellum) as Crain was to refer to your "Crainium". The bird "Crane" had nothing to do with it. Member Jon Cook has ranted and raved for years about putting the band back together, sometimes with the same name, sometimes under another "brain" related name, but either way, it's unlikely that he'd ever work with Tim again.

Members went on to Parlour, Matmos, The Soft Pink Truth; and spent time in Undermine, Spot, Cerebellum, Pope Lick, Sunspring, Lead Pennies, Endpoint, 7 More Seconds, and many, many more...
