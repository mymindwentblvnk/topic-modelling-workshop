1. Started as a side project beside Iron Maiden during their break in 1989.  Adrian Smith left Iron Maiden in 1990, some short time after the release of "Silver And Gold". Smith described in an interview that this album had probably sent the wrong signal to the guys in Maiden as they had thought Smith had lost interest in Heavy Metal and were not able to realize the AOR approach of this album. In the late 70's he was with Andy Barnett in a band called Urchin. Their style was different from Maiden, only comparable to the "Somewhere In Time" session "Reach Out"  (b-side of the "Wasted Years" single).
The name stands for Adrian Smith And Project.

Line up (last known):
Adrian Smith - Lead Vocals & Guitars ( Urchin, Iron Maiden, Psycho Motel, Bruce Dickinson)
Andy Barnett - Guitars & Vocals (Urchin, Metal Mirror)
Dave Colwell - Guitars & Vocals (Samson)
Robin Clayton - Bass
Richard Young - Keyboards
Zak Starkey - Drums (Tony Martin, The Who, Oasis)
