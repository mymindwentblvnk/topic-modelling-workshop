Ariosophic majesty from Northern Oregon. Formed in 2001, disbanded in 2013, Fanisk have released three full-length albums, "Die and Become" (Winter 2001), and "Noontide" (Summer 2003), and "Insularum" (2013). In 2006, Fanisk contributed a track titled "Nemesis" for Supernal's "Anti-Geldof Compilation". Vithólf has written lyrics for Thor's Hammer ("Grand Isolation", on "The Fate Worse Than Death") and Infernum (all lyrics for "Farewell"). On the horizon is a split with Giboraltar. Listeners will surely enjoy all Eldrig material to date as well as future Vithólf material.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fanisk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
