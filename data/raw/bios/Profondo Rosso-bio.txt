I was sent a promo copy of "To Live and Die in the UK" by this band from Neat Metal in the late 1990s and over the intervening 11 or so years despite being a fan of classic-rock I've played this tribute to the English North-East until the CD was almost  worn into a spiral of plastic.

Formed in 1992 and named after the1975 Italian cult horror directed by master of Giallo, Dario Argento, this was a band churning out powerful tunes in the finest tradition of The Jam or The Sex Pistols with well-crafted, exremely-tight songs driven by a punchy backline and vocals reminiscent of the best of the late 70s punk-era. They cite their influences from bands as diverse as the Sex Pistols and Ned's Atomic Dustbin.

Although no small amount of bad luck seems to have dogged the band activity was shown on their website at http://www.profondorosso.co.uk/. as late as 2007. They took the world by storm in the late 1990s then disappeared from the face of the earth. It's a crying shame as the music is as powerful as weapons-grade coffee and probably as addictive as a bucket-full of blue Smarties (TM).

Unfortunately no media has been uploaded to last.fm by their agents but if you want a good taster then try this album streamed from their website. Hopefully someone will work out how to get some media uploaded onto last.fm so this fine band can be appreciated even if it's a few years on! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Profondo+Rosso">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
