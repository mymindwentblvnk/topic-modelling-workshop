Friends In Paris is an Electronic/Pop project between a London born singer/songwriter now based in South West Australia and a London based producer. Having formed at the end of 2013 by the power of the world wide web, Friends In Paris is still only a budding flower, yet over the few months the duo have been writing together, theyâ€™ve found an enchanting sonic union . Their imminent Debut Ep promises fresh production, haunting melodies, soul and hard hitting beats. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Friends+In+Paris">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
