Raw vocal talent and thoughtful lyricism pair with vital and adventurous songwriting to comprise Broken Luxury. Featuring Josh Reynolds and Zach Golden, the Chicagoans work to create art that is both busy and minimal, accessible and reflective. Reynold’s voice punches viscerally amid Golden’s calculated compositions. If Golden’s sounds are a maze, Reynolds’s voice is what leads listeners through. Their debut album arouses listeners’ own emotions while eliciting the undeniable emotional context in which the music was crafted. 

   The music is founded on hard-driving electronic beats, infused with jazz-influenced rhythms and powerfully soulful vocals, that invoke feeling. Vocalist Josh Reynolds, a Berklee School of Music alum, brings a unique and impressive set of skills to the table. His vocal talent is only matched by his deft sense of rhythm and melody in complete synergy with Golden's brilliance.

   The mastermind behind the tracks, another Berklee alum Zach Golden, is relentless in his attention to detail. Building and weaving layer upon layer of rhythm and melody, there is no doubt Golden is a unique musical talent with an incredible ability to create tracks that are not only multidimensional and complex, but groovy and exciting. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Broken+Luxury">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
