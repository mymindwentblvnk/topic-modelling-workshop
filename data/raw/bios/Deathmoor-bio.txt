Deathmoor's "Opus Morte III" takes us into yet different regions of madness. Fully improvised in a studio under the constant influence of alcohol and drugs, its tempo variates between the full-speed assault and slow melancholy of the fall. Imagine yourself lost in a rainy forest on a cold autumn night.... The forest could as well be a stone forest of a big, unwelcoming city. You are lost and there is no way out of here.... Endless hostility of the dim, serpentine streets. The city indifferently witnesses your struggle, knowing that there is no chance for anyone to escape the cold claws of desolation. There is no way out.
