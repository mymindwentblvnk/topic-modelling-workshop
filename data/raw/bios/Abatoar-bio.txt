Abatoar, formed on February 2012 by this current line-up. The name was taken from a French word "abattoir" which means "slaughterhouse".

They started covering songs from some metal bands such as Lamb of God, Chimaira, and Arch Enemy. Now, they're working on their own tracks and releasing it as a demo.
