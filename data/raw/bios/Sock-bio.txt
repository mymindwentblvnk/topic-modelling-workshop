There are multiple artists with the name Sock:

1) Sock is an anthropological semi-abstract concept that, inexplicably through an obscene scientific accident, turned into flesh and, following being bitten by a radioactive synthesizer, inherited all the powers of a minimoog voyager and decided to make some music.

2) In the year of our Lord 1995, four friends started playing music together. Grady Avenell and Jeff Irwin called that band SOCK. Other bandmembers of SOCK were also in Far, and due to it's commitments had to make a choice. SOCK seized to exist. But the two afore mentioned friends continued to play music together, and asked other friends to join them to form a band, that band is now Will Haven

3) Cardiff-based four-piece Sock emerged on the local scene in late 2017 as a fully formed, perfectly defined musical force. Attention-grabbing live sets on Sofar Sounds and at Sŵn Festival, as well as support slots with emerging Cardiff stalwarts Boy Azooga and Buzzard, pricked the ears of all encountering them; their lazy, trippy, funk-rock instantly both endearing and impressive. People even lovingly threw their actual socks at them.

Drawing on elements of jazz and surf, their influences range from Mac DeMarco to Khruangbin to Blur and beyond. Characterised by their wonkily imaginative guitar and bass lines; the overall sound is underpinned by tightly administered percussion, with Jacob Church’s slow, expressive vocal reverberating out their offbeat narratives. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sock">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
