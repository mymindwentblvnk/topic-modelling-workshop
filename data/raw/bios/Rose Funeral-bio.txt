Rose Funeral is an American deathcore band from Cincinnati, Ohio, United States.

Rose Funeralâ€™s first demo, Buried Beneath the Blood, was self-recorded and self-released in March of 2006. The demo was followed quickly by the release of their EP, Crucify.Kill.Rot, in August of 2006. It was enough for them to get picked up by Siege of Amida Records, who re-released Crucify.Kill.Rot in March of 2007.

While promoting their debut album, Crucify. Kill. Rot, they toured and played shows with The Black Dahlia Murder, Unearth, Walls of Jericho, The Red Chord, Animosity, Too Pure to Die, The Faceless, Dead To Fall, As Blood Runs Black, Emmure, With Blood Comes Cleansing, Becoming The Archetype, Dead Man In Reno, For The Fallen Dreams, Diskreet, Last House On The Left, Once Nothing, My Bitter End, Endwell, Year Of Desolation, Nights Like These, In This Moment, The Burning Season, Veil Of Maya, Iscariot and more.

Their numerous regional and national tours helped gained the attention of Metal Blade Records and by early 2008, they had landed a deal. Since then, Rose Funeral has been hard at work continuing to tour across North America as well as writing their Metal Blade debut.

At a concert in February 2010 where they opened for Nile, Immolation, Krisiun, and Dreaming Dead, the band lost some credibility after attacking and kicking out some concertgoers at the front of the crowd that, by playing the popular card game UNO, were protesting that the band should not have been been hired as openers at the last minute.  This incident has led many people to mockingly refer to them as UNOcore. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rose+Funeral">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
