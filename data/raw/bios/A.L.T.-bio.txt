A.L.T. is an american rapper.

A.L.T. (born 1970 as Al Trivette) is an American rapper of Mexican and French American descent from El Monte, California. He started rapping in 1983 and started working with producer Tony G in 1989. Tony G asked him to write a track for Kid Frost; and Frost in turn asked him to join his Latin supergroup Latin Alliance. In 1991, his début album Another Latin Timebomb (mainly produced by Mike Greene and Geoff Rios) came out on Atlantic/East West, spawning the worldwide crossover hit "Tequila", a cover version of the song by the Champs. After his second album, Stone Cold World (mainly produced by Tony G), came out independently with more of a G-funk to the album, A.L.T. continued collaborating with rappers such as Slow Pain, Mellow Man Ace and Kid Frost, proving to be one of the driving forces behind the L.A. Latin rap scene, A.L.T. is featured on the new Eazy-ECPT.com Mixtape.
