Dol Theeta is the second project of the "Electronica Art Metal" vision of composer Thanasis Lightbridge, and includes Kortessa (Vocals) and Dim (Guitars) members also in Dol Ammad.

Thanasis' vision of total artistic freedom in music involved blending sounds and feelings from extremely diverse music genres such as heavy metal, electronica and opera/classical. Having released 2 albums with Dol Ammad, Thanasis needed to create more sides of his music in order to fully materialize his musical freedom. 

Thus Dol Theeta were born to express a more atmospheric and psychedelic version of "Electronica Art Metal". Dol Theeta feature a lot of ethnic elements and instrumentation something new  for Thanasis who apart from the various sounds and synthesizers, also performs the drums in the band.

Dol Theeta's discography starts in Spring 2008 with the single/mini CD "Goddess" which apart from the track "Goddess" taken from the upcoming full album, also includes 2 more exclusive/unreleased tracks and a video clip for "Goddess". The video clip is the first video released for Thanasis' music and is directed and produced by Harry Kalogirou. 

The upcoming full Dol theeta album will be entitled "The Universe Expands".
