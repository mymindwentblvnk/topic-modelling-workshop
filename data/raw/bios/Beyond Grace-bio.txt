Omni-Dimensional Death Metal Devastation from the collective unconscious of Nottingham, UK.
Transformed and transmuted, shedding the weight of the past like a snake sheds its skin.Reborn in a new, more lethal form.

We are Beyond Grace. Architects of omni-dimensional death metal devastation.

The past years of touring and playing shows with the likes of Becoming The Archetype, Abigail Williams, Demonic Resurrection and Awakening Sun have taught us much. They showed us that we needed to change. We needed to get tighter... harder... faster... heavier. And most of all, smarter...

The name has changed, but the power remains.

February 2014 sees the release of our debut EP 'Monstrous' - three tracks of thunderous progressive crush and savage technical intensity - and a UK tour with the masters of Supreme Avant-Garde Death Metal, The Monolith Deathcult.

The ongoing project 'The Bloodguard Chronicles' will continue to pay tribute to our early days, remixing and releasing classic songs for free consumption, even as we push ourselves, our skills, our potential, ever further with the writing and recording of our debut album 'Seekers'.

There is no salvation. We are all beyond grace. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beyond+Grace">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
