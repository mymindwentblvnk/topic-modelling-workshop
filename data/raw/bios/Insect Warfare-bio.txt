Insect Warfare was a grindcore band from Houston, USA. Formed in 2004, they made their first demo "Gulf Coast Infestation" later that year. This earned them some interest from 625 records, which helped to release the following year IW's next installment as a band, "At War With Grindcore" EP with 8 fast, heavy noise grind tracks on it. Alex Hughes quit the band and formed the powerviolence act Hatred Surge, later recording a split 7" through RSR with his former band.

In 2006, another EP "Endless Execution Thru Violent Restitution" and another split with Bolt Stein.

In 2007 with their demo "Evolved Into Obliteration", the band received more interest from other record companies, as this demo was their third release on their own. This ultimately lead to their first full-length album "World Extermination" released late 2007.

It has been reported by the band that after 4 years of tearing up the international grindcore scene, their final performance will be at the U.S. festival Dudefest on June 21st 2008. After this show Insect Warfare will be no more.
