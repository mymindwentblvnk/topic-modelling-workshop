Sextodecimo formed in Oxford, UK, 2000. They played heavy, noisy, slow, feedback-laden rock music. Gigs were sporadic and rare, but their consistency in creating such a "bloody racket" on stage gained them notoriety on the local underground scene and firmly established them in history as the most uncompromising band to arise from the city of Oxford. Having said this, their recorded output reflects an earlier and more restrained (and indeed orthodox) style of music which had long since disappeared from their live shows. A debut EP, "The Banshee Screams For Buffalo Meat" was released in 2004, which featured 3 tracks sprawling 34 minutes (longer than Reign In Blood). It was produced by Dave Smart of doom legends Sevenchurch. A second EP was released in 2005 as a split with 3 other bands (Holiday Stabbings, Gunnbunny and Deguello) from the Oxford underground punk/noise scene, this time produced by Ben Thomas and Ben Perrier of Winnebago Deal. Both EPs were released via Hanging Out With The Cool Kids Records/Plastic Head Distribution. Both releases received favourable reviews in the press in the UK and internationally, and the sound has been compared to the likes of Harvey Milk, Burning Witch, Swans and Eyehategod.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sextodecimo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
