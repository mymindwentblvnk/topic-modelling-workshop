Rapper Lil' Cease was born and raised in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant area, at age 15 becoming a protégé of the Notorious B.I.G. With his distinctive lisping style, he made his recorded debut in 1994 as a member of the Junior M.A.F.I.A., issuing the single "Players Anthem"; the full-length Conspiracy followed in 1995, and that same year Lil' Cease scored a hit with the Lil' Kim duet "Crush on You." On March 9, 1997, he and the Notorious B.I.G. were driving away from a party in Los Angeles when Biggie was shot and killed; Lil' Cease continued as a solo artist, signing to Lil' Kim's Queen Bee label and issuing The Wonderful World of Cease A Leo in mid-1999. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lil%27+Cease">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
