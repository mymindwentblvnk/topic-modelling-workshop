Sepalcure’s combination of love for bass and 90's house acapellas is the culmination of a cathartic two week collaboration between Travis Stewart (Machinedrum) and Praveen Sharma (Praveen & Benoît). Their mix of tribal dub, house and 2-step beats works equally well for both late nights in the club and rainy, introspective nights at home. Detroit techno chords cut through wooden beats, neon synths and dubbed out atmospherics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sepalcure">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
