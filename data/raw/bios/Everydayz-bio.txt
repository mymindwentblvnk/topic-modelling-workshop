Ilia "Everydayz" Koutchoukov is a man of his times, getting inspiration from everywhere, anyone, everydays.

Originally from Perpignan, south of France, Ilia spent most of his musical youth between the sounds of the streets, the electronic rhythms’ that he used to listen at home and the pretty official benches of the conservatory.

The producer never wanted to choose between vintage and contemporary. Better, he plays around, mixing styles and colors to create hybrid melodies. From 70’s black music to hip hop and pop music.

It’s hard to keep Everydayz locked into one category, he comes from beatmaking but does not hesitate to go elsewhere; sometimes dee-jay but also composing its original work.

His tour with rapper Nemir as well as his individual performances brought him a solid scene experience, giving him credibility to perform at Boiler Room in 2013.

Clear validation of his talent, Everydayz started collaborating with producer and dee-jay Agoria within the duo that they form together, SunLune. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Everydayz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
