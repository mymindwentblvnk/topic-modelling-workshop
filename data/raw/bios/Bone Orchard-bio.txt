1) Bone Orchard was a batcave group from the UK, active during the early 80s. With their wild bass antics, offbeat tribal drums, shreds of shrieking rockabilly tinged guitar, and lurid, poetic lyrics sung with tortured, guttural female vocals, they (along with contemporaries like Ausgang, Inca Babies, Sunglasses After Dark, etc.) expanded on the dark, noisy theatrics of The Birthday Party.  Their only recordings date from 1983 to 1985.
