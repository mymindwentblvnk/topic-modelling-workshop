Alphabeat is a pop band from Silkeborg, Denmark signed to Polydor. The band were previously named Sodastar but this was changed to avoid confusion with a German band. 

Their Danish debut single Fascination was a major hit in Denmark during the summer of 2007. A second single 10,000 Nights saw equal success, just like their eponymous debut album that went platinum in Denmark.

Their sound is mainly retro 80s melodic pop, taking inspiration amongst others from Deacon Blue and Prefab Sprout, with distinctive overlay of male and female harmonies.

Their native success attracted the attention of several major labels from larger markets abroad, and Alphabeat were eventually signed to EMI's Charisma Records label in the United Kingdom. Their British debut single, Fantastic 6, was released on 26 November 2007. Several popular British publications have praised Alphabeat including NME, The Sun, The Observer Music Monthly, Digital Spy and Popjustice.

The band was offered to play as a warm-up for the Spice Girls during their reunion world tour 2007-8, but declined the offer, feeling that it would be "too weird" to suddenly play in front of a very large audience unfamiliar with the band's music.

On 2 March 2008, the song Fascination reached number 23 in the UK Singles Chart on download sales alone, and on 9 March 2008, following its physical CD release, it climbed to number seven, the following week it rose to number six. The band's debut British album was entitled This is Alphabeat.
