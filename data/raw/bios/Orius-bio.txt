Formed in the Summer of 2003, Orius immediately launched into stamping their own brand of dynamic and uncompromising alternative/heavy rock on the burgeoning Stourbridge music scene.
 
Extensive gigging and the release of several self-produced EP’s, between 2003 and 2007, have earned Orius impressive reviews and an ever-growing fanbase.  Their reputation on the live circuit has been formed by manic live performances, captivating audiences with their energy and enthusiasm. Six years on, Orius have developed a style that is alive with diversity; boasting contagious guitar riffs, provocative lyrics and emphatic vocals backed by a hard-hitting rhythm section.
 
In 2007, Orius released their critically acclaimed debut album ‘Us V You’ through Code 7 distribution.  ‘Us V You’ was an instant hit with fans, and its impressive reviews prompted the bands 2008 EP ‘Me and the Girl.’ 
 
Heady with the success of  ‘Us V You’ and ‘Me and the Girl’, this 4-piece enlisted the skills of producer Andy Taylor (Editors, Twang, Babes in Toyland) for the creation of their greatly anticipated new double A-side single ‘Saving Grace / The Reckoners’ which is set to elevate them to new heights. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Orius">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
