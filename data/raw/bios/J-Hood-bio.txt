A young lyrical artist, formerly of the hip-hop group D-Block, Joshua Hood, also known as J-Hood was born in North Carolina on July 12, 1984 and moved to Yonkers, New York when he was 8 years old. J-Hood believes that he can bring flamboyant punchlines and complex wordplay to any track he spits on. He has been in the mixtape game for six years, and has done many tracks with his closest friend in The LOX, Sheek Louch. After doing many collaborations with Jadakiss, Styles P, Sheek Louch, and other non-D-Block rappers: Cassidy, Jin, J.R. Writer, and Ruff Ryders, he started to produce his own mixtapes and songs that are produced by Liveson, Poobs and Vinny Idol, and hosted by the Running Up Hosting DJ Big Mike and D-Block's Leader, Supa Mario.
In late 2007 J-Hood asked to be released from the group D-Block/LOX and now no longer considered a part of the group. Since then he has released several remarks disrespecting his former group. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/J-HOOD">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
