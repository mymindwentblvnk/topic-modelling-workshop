In a Dark Fair world there was a dark haired girl who met a fair haired girl. They created dark electric, low-carb indie pop, peppered in punk to be inhaled on the dance floor.

THE DARK FAIR

The Dark Fair took pop music and gave it its first cigarette.

Fronted by Ramona Moore (lead singer/guitarist) and Eleanor Dunn (drummer/vocalist), the Melbourne-based duo formed in 2011 after meeting and bonding over loves like The Divinyls, black jeans and low-carb beer.

For a year though the girls were divided. Living in two different cities, they made the most of their long-distance musical bond by jamming, recording and doing shows when airfares were at their lowest. Finally though, in the middle of the long, lingering, low cloud Melbourne winter, Eleanor landed her shuttle and promised to stay forever.

Their debut EP, ‘Penny Universe’, is an ode to chaos, paranoia, black holes and the pursuit of happiness - all within this 'penny universe'. It was recorded and produced with the likes of Dave Mcluney (Nick Cave), Magoo (Regurgitator) and Stuart Sikes (Cat Power).
