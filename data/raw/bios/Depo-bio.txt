Depo was an indie rock four-piece band from Rīga, Latvia since 2000 till 2002.

They are usually referred to as one of best Latvian bands today and almost the only hope for the Latvian indie scene. Usually people associate them with Joy Division and The Strokes.

On June 1st 2002 they released their first CD, a 7 song EP "Alepo" (recorded in "Tornis" studio), performing an acoustic set on a street corner in Rīga. John Peel played two songs from it on his BBC Radio 1 shows during summer 2002 and named this EP as one of the best albums in August. Needless to say no Latvian rock band has achieved something like that up to now.
