In february '10 the 6 dudes from Wecanwalkonwatertoo had the urge to play some brutal music.
some of them had former projects that disbanded, so they really needed to spend their time on some new music.
with different musical backgrounds the music consist of every good thing from deathcore/death metal/metalcore/hardcore/beatdown and various boybands of the 90's.
in july they recorded their first 3-song demo and are now ready to play shows. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wecanwalkonwatertoo">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
