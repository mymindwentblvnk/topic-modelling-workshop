In january 2007 a group of friends created a band to play songs from their favorite bands among different music styles such as metal, ska, rock, etc. What started as crazy idea kept evolving until the band became Eldelvar and started producing its own music under the main writer, Horaci Brians√≥. In 2009 they released their demo with ten tracks and a more defined music style, folk metal.

Eldelvar kept evolving and sharing its music around during two years until they decided to record more things. In 2011 they started recording what would become their first CD, with a better sound quality and the previous demo. After many months of recording and editing, while carrying on with our lives and personal projects, Once Upon a Beer was born and it arrives in 2012 to reborn Eldelvar's spirit. Sharing its music and enjoying making it for its own pleasure and for all the people who has showed support to the band.
