Jinsang is a low-profile beatmaker who specializes in idyllic, slightly dazed left-field hip-hop trackswith elements sourced from dusty soul and jazz recordings. The Californian made his debut with the EP-length beat tape Kona Park (2014), and has refined his approach through an assortment of short-from releases and stray tracks, as well as albums including Gratitude (2015), Solitude. (2016), Life (2016), and Confessions (2017). The producer's output has been self-issued digitally and made available on streaming platforms. Some of the releases have been pressed in small quantities on cassette or Vinyl through the blind Love, Dirty Beauty, and Vinyl Digital labels. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi
