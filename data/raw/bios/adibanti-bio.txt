Adibanti is a West-London-born singer, multi-instrumentalist and producer. He infuses lo-fi and hazy sonics with genres like UKG, UK House and DnB.   Growing up listening to the likes of countrymen Radiohead, Mr Scruff and Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs has added an indie/alternative edge to his productions and melodies.   His latest release 'The Overflow' is a testament to his musical upbringing. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/adibanti">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
