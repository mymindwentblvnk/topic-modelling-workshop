Keltish is a Wammie-nominated five-piece band whose players have widely different musical backgrounds, including Jazz, Rock, Blues, African, Latin and Middle Eastern in addition to the underlying Celtic sound that is the foundation of this band.
Keltish plays a mix of acoustic and electric instruments, and the tunes chosen are often traditional Celtic tunes with a fun and tasteful modern twist, or modern pieces made to be more... well, "Keltish"!
 Keltish was the first “live” band to perform in Second Life (SL). Second Life is an online society, a 3-D virtual world built and owned by its residents.
Keltish plays regularly in SL, performing in Lynn’s living room and broadcasting their sound over the internet, to be enjoyed by other SL residents in the US and abroad.
The SL concerts take place in the “Blarney Stone”, a fun little online bar in "Dublin". 
Keltish performs (in real life) mostly in Washington DC, northern Virginia and Maryland.
