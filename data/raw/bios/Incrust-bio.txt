Incrust was created by Moises SG Grinder in 1998, with the intent of playing the most intense and morbid underground Death Metal possible.  Incrust has a vision to keep the "Metal of Death" alive the way it was meant to be played, violent and raw.

Moises SG Grinder - Bass & Vocals recruited Guilherme Saldanha - Guitar, Mateus Oliveira - Drums and Joao Resh - Guitar, but after their first rehearsal Joao left the band.  Incrust decided to leave the band as a trio and continue the Death Metal bloody reign.

In september 2000 Incrust released "Brutal Penetration in a Dead Woman" promo-tape, produced by Sergio Baloff, this release was really chaotic and rotten.

In the bloody morning of September 11, 2001 during the holocaust (the record session beginning 9:00 am!), the recorded "The Bloody Art of Torture" a 4 song demo-tape, produced by Sergio Baloff(Headhunter D.C.) and with a special limited edition of 66 copies soaked in virgin menstrual blood....during the mix./master, another dead appear: One suicide at studio's exit, around the same street... Morbid coincidence again...

The band entered the studio in November 2003 to record 3 new songs for a morbid limited tape called "Hellhearsal" (#66 copies).  Without a final mix, the production was totally dirty and heavy.

Their unholy Metal brother and underground supporter John McEntee (Incantation, Funerus, Ibex Moon Records) contacted the band and an agreement was made for the Incrust release known as "Baptized in Unholy Gore", special ed with Demos, mastered in New York by Roger Beaujard (Mortician) and cover art by French Legend Chris Moyen (Beherit, Incantation, Blasphemy...).

Coming soon: "Beyond The Dead Flesh"...
