Into Salvation started as a jam session band, but soon grew into a full-time band. Our music is fast, definitely technical and partly melodic also. We are influenced by several death metal and metalcore bands.
In the future we are hoping to have a lot gigs in Estonia and who knows - maybe even further than that.

Members:
Kask - Vocals
Juni - Guitar
Markus - Drums
Sten - Bass
Martin - Guitar 


NOTE : Apparently there is a German band with the same name, but just so you'd know it's a newer band (according to the date of the creation of their myspace profile) and please, do not mix those 2 up, this is the profile for the Estonian one, so please, rename your band or just make another last.fm profile and don't upload your singles under this profile. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Into+Salvation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
