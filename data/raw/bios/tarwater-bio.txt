[01/07] Bernd Jestram and Ronald Lippok are Tarwater. Their story started back in 1995 when Bernd Jestram bought his first digital sampling machine. And when Ronald Lippok said something like: “Oh, let’s do some music together”. Since this time both – close friends since their roots in East-Berlin’s sub- and avantgardeculture – have done a lot. They made soundtracks to German silent movies of the 1920s, made musical environments for drama plays from Arthur Miller to Anton Tschechow. And, first of all, they released several records under the flag of Tarwater. If one is talking about the electronic music scene Berlin was famous for in the late 1990s one has to talk about
Tarwater.
Bernd Jestram and Ronald Lippok share their passion for repitition, improvisation and experiments with the Punk or Krautrock movements. Both, Jestram and Lippok are
sound searchers – at home in their studio, next to it a chamber full of all kind of instruments. Well, nearly all kind. Every track or song they made starts with a unique sound – or even with the unique idea of a sound. Although there are a few of nearly old-school guitar based songs on their latest releases „The Needle Was Travelling“ and „Spider Smile“ .
Tarwater is an on-going process, sensitive about its skills, curious about its sounds, clever in its allegories.
