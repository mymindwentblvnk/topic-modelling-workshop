Formed in 1998 in Bordeaux, France, Hellraper plays raw thrash/speed metal slightly influenced by black metal. Although the band includes Black Lord Beleth' Rim, it has nothing to do with The Black Legions. They released one EP, titled Feed Bitches with Satan's Seed in 2003. The band is currently on hold. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hellraper">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
