Defilementory is a brutal death metal/technical death metal band from Denmark.
The band was formed in 2008 by Fischer, Johnny and former vocalist Jesper, with whom they parted ways around the same time that Richardt and Simon joined the band in 2009. “Gory Defilement”, Defilementory’s first demo, was recorded in late 2009 and released in 2010.
After roughly a year of writing and rehearsing new songs, as well as playing some bigger shows with, among others, Putrid Pile and Corpus Mortale, the band’s second release, “Infatuation With Deformity”, came out in February 2011. In this two-track single, the band delved into a darker, more atmospheric sound in contrast to their earlier, more traditional approach to playing brutal death metal.
On their debut full-length album “The Dismal Ascension”, released by Torture Music Records in July 2014, the band expanded on the experimental style of “Infatuation With Deformity”, drawing influences from groups such as Ulcerate, Gorguts and Vengeful, while at the same time not losing track of their roots in traditional brutal death metal either.

Current line-up:
Fischer – vocals & bass
Simon – guitar
Lars – guitar
Richardt – drums
