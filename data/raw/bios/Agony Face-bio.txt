BIO
Agony face was formed back in 2004 and nothing interesting happened
except for some line-up changes.In 2006 the beasty drummer "Bass"
joins the band and the first unripe demo with the first works is recorded.

THE TURNING POINT: sick of the usual stuff in 2007 the band decides
to radically modify the style of their songs, inserting some prog elements
and some surreal influence, taken from art and philosophy.

We present a schizophrenic and surreal death metal with "golden ratio"
structures and harmonizations based on pitagoric rules, hypnotic melted
scales and modern technical-progressive elements. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Agony+Face">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
