Sod Hauler, not your typical stoner doom group. Sod Hauler plays anthems for pirates of the dustbowl as well as defiant, fuzzed-out odes to Sirens everywhere. The Seattle Trio brings thunder from the valleys as well as the rumble from the sea together to honor and respect Dark Energy. And like the dark energy, from which all life races towards death and all death seeps back into existence, Sod Hauler brings the heavy. Born of toil, sweat, all-to-occasional free beer, and the necessity to rock, Sod Hauler has outlasted several line-up changes and is now cast from the heavy metal of truth, conviction, and brotherhood. Cascading riffs evoke ghosts both unfamiliar and known. Earthen vocals breathe life unto fallen warriors to ride again. The battery of rhythms charges the unison of fists clutching for oranges. The low-end adds a depth to the sonic brew, intoxicating and fucked up. 

The power trio takes the doom/sludge genre into a new era, with their most recent Fertilizer EP. The self-produced album starts out with smokey riffs and ends with a triumphant fist pumping, guitars in the air finish. Once again a great example of how Sod Hauler evolves their sound from album to album.
