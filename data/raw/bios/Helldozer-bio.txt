Helldozer started in the hot steamy summer of 2003 when Jef and Bart (classmates) decided to start a metalband. They both had been playing in several metal/hc/rock bands and felt the need for something different. They recruted Jeroen and Steven into the band and started the search for a singer.

Several Screamers joined the helldozers at rehearsal, but it wasn't till April 2004 that Stevie walked upto Demis and asked him if he would like to give it a try. A month later Demis drove up to Malines and after 2 hours of screaming and puffing both Helldozer and Demis were convinced the band finally was complete!

In 2005 the Dozers recorded a demo at the Shumcot soundlab called "Here comes the helldozer", containing 4 songs. It was mastered in the CCR studio and printed in 300 pieces.

Late 2006 Jef left the band for personal reasons. The erst of Helldozer was left  to make a critical coice. Continue as a 4some or recruit a new member. After some auditions the band decided that the the fourpiece formula was going to work best so they went on to conquer the flat lands of flanders with their incredibly evil rock and roll tunes.

During the summer of 2007 the idea of a Helldozer/Sludge phenomenon was born and a few months later Helldozer entered the famous CCR studios in Zulte record 6 tracks that are to be released on the split early 2008.
