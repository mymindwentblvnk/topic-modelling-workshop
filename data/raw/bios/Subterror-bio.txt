Subterror is a trio from Brasília, Brasil formed in 2009. They released their first demo “Desespero” in 2010 and a split 7” with the band Do You Think I Care (Hungary) in 2011.
In 2013 they released another split 7 inch with São Paulo’s DEFY named “Human Beings Should Have Never Evolved…At All!” Then toured Europe in the same year.
All of those who crave for some Crust mixed with Metal, or simply for a clash between Bolt Thrower and Disrupt, or Hellshock and Doom, won’t be disappointed with their full-length “Antropomortum” out on Black Hole Productions.
