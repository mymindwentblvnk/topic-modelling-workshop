Aura Noir is a black/thrash metal act from Norway. Their style tends more toward old-school BM.

Originating as a duet of multi-instrumentalists, Apollyon and Aggressor, Aura Noir grew into a full-scale band when Blasphemer of Mayhem joined their cause.
Over the time, the band's recordings featured several notable guests, including Fenriz of Darkthrone on vocals.

Soon after releasing "The Merciless" (2004) on Darkthrone's label Tyrant Syndicate, Aggressor got into an accident (fell from the roof of a four-story building in Oslo), which left his lower half temporarily paralyzed.  He spent several months in the hospital but is already playing guitar again. In 2008, Aura Noir released "Hades Rise," which boasted a guest appearance by Danny Corrales of Autopsy and Abscess. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aura+Noir">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
