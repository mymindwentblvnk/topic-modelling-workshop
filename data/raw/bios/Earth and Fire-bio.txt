Earth and Fire (1967-1983 and 1987-1990) was a slightly psychedelic and symphonic pop band, with singer and front woman Jerney Kaagman and twin brothers Chris Koerts (guitars) and Gerard Koerts (keyboards) as its core members. The band members hailed from places Voorschoten, Voorburg and Leidschendam, suburban towns of The Hague, The Netherlands.

The band was founded in 1967 as Opus Gainfull, but changed its name into Earth and Fire as early as in 1968. The Koerts twins were two of the founding members.

The band's big break in The Netherlands came in 1970 with Seasons, a song written by George Kooymans, guitarist of fellow The Hague rockers Golden Earring. The single reached #2 in the Dutch charts. Between 1970 and 1983 eighteen Earth and Fire singles charted in The Netherlands. Nine made it to the top ten, two (1972's Memories and 1979's Weekend) reached #1. The latter was also hit internationally.

The band released eight studio albums, of which Reality Fills Fantasy (1979) was the most succesful one, reaching #2 in the Dutch album charts.

The departure of founding member Chris Koerts in 1979 marked the beginning of the end for Earth and Fire. The group eventually folded in 1983, after which Jerney Kaagman embarked on a solo career, to little commercial success. 

Earth and Fire briefly resurfaced briefly in 1987, without the Koerts brothers and with Ton Scherpenzeel (formerly of symphonic rock band Kayak) as its musical leader. 'Earth and Fire Mark II' released one single that failed to chart, and no albums.
