A rising band from North Carolina (USA), Domination Through Impurity appeared in early 2004 in the form of the duo of vocalist/guitarist Joe Payne and drummer Jordan Varela, both of which are also members of Lust Of Decay. Inspired by such names like Meshuggah and Necrophagist, they intended forging a new sound, something in the field of technical death metal. It took them not much time to record and release through Comatose Music their first album entitled Essence Of Brutality. All trademarks of tech-death are undeniably present here, and so DTI's future seems to be bright, if guys aren't going to let up.

P.S. Bassist Dan Royer joined the band after the first release. All bass tracks were done by Joe Payne. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Domination+Through+Impurity">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
