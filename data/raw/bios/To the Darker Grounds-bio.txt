To The Darker Grounds (now known as Darker Grounds) was formed in early 2002 by the leadsinger Olli-Pekka Rissanen and guitarist Henri Mäkijokela. Soon after the
band was formed Jussi Harju (keyboards), Ville Miinala (drums) and Teemu Ylinikka (bass) joined.

At first main idea was to play cover songs from bands such as Dimmu Borgir and Eternal Tears of Sorrow, but soon the idea of playing also own songs became real.

In summer 2002 Henri was asked to leave because of his attitude and Matti Palenius came to fill the line-up with Markku Kerosalo, the bassist of the band May I Cry, on rhythm guitars. Matti left the band in the end of the year.

As Juhana Länttä came to replace Matti, we started recording our very first demo titled "Sundown". After few gigs, Markku left To The Darker Grounds because he found his other project May I Cry more important.Homepage:www.ttdg.org <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/To+The+Darker+Grounds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
