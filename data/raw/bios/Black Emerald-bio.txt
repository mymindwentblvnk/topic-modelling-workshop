Black Emerald is a Reading area based band, sporting influences ranging from hard rock, thrash, doom, southern and progressive metal.

Black Emerald reared it's progressive, stoner, thrash head from the scruffiest of Reading's depths, to show that the ways of old school are far from dead.  Only to be revitalized with a new found energy.  All with crushing Hard Rock Riffs.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Emerald">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
