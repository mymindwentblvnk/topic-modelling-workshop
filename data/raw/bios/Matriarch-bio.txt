There are multiple artists operating under the name Matriarch:

1) Matriarch are a death/black metal band formed in 2002 in Puerto Rico. They released the Black Apples demo in 2003. The demo featured the quintet of Shamara Irizarry on drums, Ara López on guitar/low vocals, Vanessa Urrutia on guitar/soprano, Isabel Conde on bass/grim vocals, and Michelle Baez on keyboards. Shortly thereafter, the band parted ways with Michelle. In 2004, the song Sinful Decadence was recorded as an attempt to display Matriarch’s virtuosity beyond the confines of the Black Apples demo, marking an evolutionary step to their repertoire. This continued with the recording of the song Profanity in mid 2005, further exemplifying Matriarch’s presence in the metal world.

The summer of 2006 saw the departure of co-founding member and guitarist/vocalist Ara when it became apparent of her needs to focus more on her personal life. In the Fall of 2006, Matriarch began recording their debut album, Revered unto the Ages, and finalized the recording process in December after a grueling four month process. The album also sees drummer Shamara stepping in to perform the low/death metal vocal duties that became vacant with the absence of Ara from the band. Revered unto the Ages was released in 2007.

2)  Matriarch is the alias of J. Spotts, a noise/industrial artist currently based out of western Massachusetts. She began the project after the downfall of her previous project Mellified Man in late 2021/early 2022, with the intent of creating more cohesive, sensitive, and composed electronics. After playing many live sets that were acclaimed in the noise community on the east coast, including sets in New York City and Richmond, Virginia, she released her first tape, “Jeffersonville”, on New Forces Noise in September of 2022. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Matriarch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
