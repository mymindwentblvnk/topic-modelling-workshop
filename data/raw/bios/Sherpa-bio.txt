There are more than one artist with this name:
1) A Spanish metal band
2) A five-piece psychedelic/power pop band from Auckland, New Zealand
3) A Norwegian band who mixes hip-hop, roots and jazz


1) After almost fifteen years away from the rock scene, the former bass player and frontman of the band Barón Rojo, Jose Luis Campuzano is back with a solo record. Tunes that could have been out of any Baron Rojo record, including a cover of the immortal "House of the Rising Sun". For fans of artists like Barón Rojo, AC/DC, and Bruce Springsteen.

2) With their previous releases 'I'm Sparklers' and 'Pretty Cool Optical Illusions' earning them a Groove Guide album of the week, two number ones on the bFM Top Ten, a Roundhead Studios Live In Session, opening slots for Darwin Deez, The Clean, Real Estate and a noteworthy performance at this year's Auckland Laneway Festival, Sherpa are set to paint 2012 in a psychedelic haze with the release of their anticipated debut album - 'Lesser Flamingo'. A high speed blend of blood, sweat and tears with bowl cuts, feathers and rainbow kaftans, Sherpa's music is both raw and flamboyant, energized and unashamedly fun.
