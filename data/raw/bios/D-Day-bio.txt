2) Punk/New Wave band from Austin, Texas, regionally popular in the early 80's.

De Lewellen - vocals 
Stuart Hillyer - guitar
Dave Fore - drums 
John Keller - bass
Glover Gill - keyboards
Will Fiveash - guitar (replaced Stuart Hillyer)

D-Day's first 45 rpm single "Too Young To Date" was written by David Fore and De Lewellen. 
It reached as high as #1 on Rodney Bingenheimer's show on KROQ in Los Angeles.  A second single "Right to Know" also got a fair amount of air time on KROQ and on KLBJ in Austin.  This led to a record with A&M in 1982 when Glover and Will had joined the band.

Note that after the band had been together for a while, Glover Gill joined on keyboards and eventually Will Fiveash replaced Stuart Hillyer on guitar.  You can read more about D-Day on this site: http://www.madmartian.com/music_dday.htm
