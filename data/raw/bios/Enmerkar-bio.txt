ENMERKAR  began in 2007 in New York City, USA as an ambient, black metal project, by the sole member Morchiant.  The concepts behind the music relate to mysticism, shamanism, and the Universe and its mysteries.  The music combines black metal, post-metal and ambient music with distant vocals to create monolithic and ethereal soundscapes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Enmerkar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
