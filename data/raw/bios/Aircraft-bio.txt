There is a desperate honesty in Richmond-based band Aircraft that truly sets them apart from mainstream rock and roll. Their self-proclaimed emo-pop music is just that: pop tunes that get embedded in your head, pulsed by pure emotion.

Aircraft's rich sustained textures of two guitars drenched in echo, combined with patient arrangements, provides for a large field of view. They can create a vivid landscape or an uplifting dance song. The bass and drums of Aircraft are not just the backbone of the band, but they are also the cirulatory system. They are very complex in the way they are intricately routed through the song, yet they maintain a simplicity that is desired. The keyboards have become one of the band's signature sounds. They keys seem to wrap themselves around the spine of the music in the sense of rhythm, while creating the perfect shading to an already very defined picture. Aircraft's vocals seem to rise up from the deep within the music. Rather than singing over top of a bed of instruments, the music of Aircraft seems to dictate where the vocals should go. The melodies are very accessible. They stay with you and won't let you go. Add to that their quirky timbre and the sound is complete.

Seeing Aircraft live is a true manifestation of this unique entity. The Richmond Times Dispatch said it best: "Some bands play stadiums. Some bands play rock clubs. Aircraft can play a rock club and sound like they're in a stadium." The fact is Aircraft looks like they sound....sophisticated, energetic and honest. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aircraft">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
