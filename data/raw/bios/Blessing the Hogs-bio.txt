One of San Francisco's heaviest quartet's, often praised for their original and uneasily characterized sound, BLESSING THE HOGS forge a style of heavy music all their own. Punishing vo-kills, rapid-fire drums and dropped tuned sludge mayhem - all the key ingredients that Blessing The Hogs are known for - show up in spades in all three of their albums; Blessing The Hogs, The Poisoning (2002), and The Twelve Gauge Solution (2005). Featuring Billy Anderson (studio wizard who has worked with the likes of MELVINS, MR. BUNGLE, BRUTAL TRUTH, HIGH ON FIRE, FANTOMAS, KISS IT GOODBYE, NEUROSIS, EYEHATEGOD, UNSANE, SICK OF IT ALL, and many more) among their lineup, BLESSING THE HOGS show no sign of relenting on their musical quest. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blessing+the+Hogs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
