Di'Anno was a heavy metal band from England formed by ex-Iron Maiden singer Paul Di'Anno, after that the band split up he started his new band Battlezone, and later Killers.

Di'Anno (1983–1985):
Di'Anno was the first project by Paul Di'Anno after he was fired from Iron Maiden. This group was originally called Lonewolf but after certain disagreements with a group already called Lone Wolf, they changed their name and ended up recording only one album under the simple moniker of Di'Anno. 

On the tour Paul refused to play any Iron Maiden songs (much to the dismay of the crowd), playing only their own songs and a few other covers (most notably Van Halen's version of The Kinks You Really Got Me and Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood. After minimal success, the six piece band disbanded shortly after they were done touring.

The only other items available from this band are a single of "Heartuser", a single Japanese release of "Flaming Heart" and a Sweden VHS release called "Live at the Palace" (today in DVD as "Di'Anno Live From London"). During this performance, the band played an unreleased song entitled Spiritual Guidance, which Paul told the audience would be on the band's forthcoming new album. This album was never recorded, leading some fans of the Di'Anno project to speculate that there may yet be more material from 1984/1985 laying around somewhere.

Di'Anno/Nomad (2000–present):
Di'Anno had a reunion in 2000 and released the album Nomad which later was re-released by Paul Di'Anno solo in 2006 as The Living Dead.
