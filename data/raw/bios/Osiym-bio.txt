OSIYM (Out of Sight, In Your Mind) is the next up in the new wave of Toronto artists that is starting to get shine right now.  They are not new to the game however. Charlie Black and Nova have both been on the underground scene in the city for some time now, creating a buzz for themselves individually before linking up to form a lyric lover's dream team. Charlie Black has already gotten two mixtapes under his belt ( D.E.S.T.A. Dude & Work in Progress ) with the latter featuring the song, “Blue Jay fitted low” ft. JD Era which got a lot of love on Flow 93.5 and You Tube. Nova also recently just finished promoting his “It was all a dream: The HIStory” mixtape which received a lot of love from local blogs and YouTube. Now they’re looking to up the ante and shake up the game. So enjoy, there is much more music to come.
