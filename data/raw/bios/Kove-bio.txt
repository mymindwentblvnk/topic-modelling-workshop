18 months ago only a select few knew who James Rockhill was. Now millions know him as Kove.
Shortly after his first release, ‘Breach/Stellar,’ released on Matrix and Futurebounds’ Viper Recordings, RAM Records’ boss Andy C signed ‘Iodine/Open Ground’ to his new imprint Program Recordings. The track was featured on the legendary DJ’s Mixmag mix CD, which led to Kove being invited to play at RAM’s residency at London’s infamous club Fabric.

Only a month after the release of ‘Iodine’ and Kove’s track ‘Searching’ found it’s way into the hands of chart topping producers Chase & Status, who included it in their own Mixmag mix CD. It became Kove’s second track to feature on the magazine in just six short months. A record deal with Chase & Status’ label MTA (also home to Nero), followed. Soon Kove was supporting them at club nights across Europe as the track became one of the biggest releases of the summer, receiving major support from Radio 1 and reaching the #1 spot on Beatport’s D&B chart. 

With remixes for Chase & Status’ top 10 hit ‘Lost and Not Found’ and John Newman’s massive no.1 single, ‘Love Me Again,’ now nearing 3 million views on YouTube, Kove has become increasingly in demand as a re-mixer. This summer has also seen his stock rise as a DJ, with a regular slot for Together at Ibiza’s famous Amnesia and playing the main stage for UKF at SW4 in London - not to mention support slots for the likes of Sub Focus.
With so much achieved in such a short space of time, 2014 will undoubtedly propel Kove further into the limelight.
