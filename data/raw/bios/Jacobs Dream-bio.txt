Jacobs Dream is an American Christian power metal band originally based out of Columbus, Ohio, that formed in the mid 1990s under the name of Iron Angel.

The band features guitarists John Berry and Jon Noble, bassist James Evans, drummer Gary Holtzman, and frontman Chaz Bond. The groups first major release was in 2000 with their self titled album Jacobs Dream which was released on Metal Blade Records. The bands original vocalist David Taylor left after the second album Theater of War due to family commitments. Taylor was then replaced by ex-Biogenesis vocalist Chaz Bond who first appeared on the 2005 album Drama of the Ages. The sound of the band could be described as that of Iron Maiden or Judas Priest with slightly more progressive tendencies, similar to that of Queensr√øche or Fates Warning, but heavier. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jacobs+Dream">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
