The Sweet Leaf was founded by Fernando Benitez (Raxas, Acrostic, El Diablo, Simio, La Orquesta de Animales, THC), Sury Attie and Alain Sefchovich in the early nineties in Mexico City. Soon after that, Claudio Arellano on guitars and tattoo artist Oscar Montes a.k.a. El Compa joined on bass. Former members included C.A. (Mechanical Chaos, Makina), El Thrasher (Atoxxico), and Adela Mizrahi on vocals. By that time, stoner rock was unforgivably smashed by the mainstream, the mexican new wave of rock which stand for banning all English references such as lyrics and latin sounds were encouraged.

Despite these hurdles, TSL toiled in the club circuit playing with several punk, glam and testosterone-fueled biker-metal bands. One of their most important shows was as an opening act for The Obsessed, who hit mexican soil back in 1994.

A year earlier, they released a 7’’ called Rotten, which lately met the vehement ears of Cathedral’s Lee Dorrian and catch the attention of Germany’s Hellhound Records. This EP is very hard to be found and it raises in some retail collector’s stores up to 30€. In 1996, a cassette was self released titled Take a hit with Adela Mizrahi’s vocals. Yet again, this work is tough to get.

They received several reviews by magazines and fanzines such as Reflections of Doom, Metal Maniacs, Less than One and Banda Rockera. 

The Sweet Leaf quit the scenarios in 1997, and all members dedicated themselves to give birth to new projects that would take the lead for early mexican stoner bands such as El Diablo.

Finally, during 2008, TSL is back with two new members, Adolfo Sarabia (TCH, La Orquesta de Animales, Las Bailarinas) on keyboards and Gaby de la O (Dagger, Occulta) on vocals.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Sweet+Leaf">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
