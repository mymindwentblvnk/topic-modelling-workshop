Bloated Carcass from the United States of America (Birmingham, Alabama) play memorable Death/Thrash metal that is both old school as well as innovative and new. We pride ourselves on our uniqueness and try not to follow any trends. Our goal is to play cult extreme metal our own way with lots of surprises that will leave you begging for more or crying for it to end! Bloated Carcass was formed in 2004 by Ground Chuck (Vocals / Bass) and Ryan Sullivan (Guitar)  to make true underground Death/Thrash metal of the classic variety. The duo soon drafted fellow metal-obsessed weirdos, Chris McDonald (Drums), and Michael Stew (Guitar) to complete their lineup and to help spread the putrid yet intriguing stench of Bloated Carcass throughout all the world!
