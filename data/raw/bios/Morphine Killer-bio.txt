Morphine Killer was founded in 2007. After two bands had not worked out (Reckoning Day & Honor The Fallen), Eski combined with efforts with Belle Roka (Xob) as she was trying to pursue a solo career. As a way to write new songs, Eski started what would eventually become the musical entity Morphine Killer.
