Belaire are twins Cari and Christa Palazzolo and Matt Simon and Jason Chronis of voxtrot.  In another life not so far away, a petite and beautiful girl emerges lightfooted from a subway with her scarf trailing behind her.  She grabs the hand of the old woman standing at the crosswalk and leads her across the boulevard, pirouetting around her while citroens and renaults screech to a hault. crackle, crackle, and everything's quiet and still for a moment as the blind beggar encamped at the base of the flower boutique flips to side b of a belaire record and slowly cranks his old gramophone to continue the soundtrack to this idyllic carnival.  The undescribable creative assemblage that is belaire has been serendipitously patched together from members of arkay, fozlur, flashlight fiction, voxtrot, and fancy feast. 

Together, the band mixes genres at will floating from brazil funk to italian movie scores to carnival music to new wave to italo disco and back again to form a cohesive and incredibly addictive sound all their own, 'exploding impacting' is their much-awaited debut album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Belaire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
