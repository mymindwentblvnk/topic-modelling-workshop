IMPALE has been around since 2002 (First ever gig was June 15, 2002 at a block party). The original members, Frank Shannon - guitar, Phil Messina - drums, and Ed Cichon - bass, started the band, and through different member changes, found Jay McGury - vocals, and Kenny McClarin - guitars (ex members of metal band Rupture). IMPALE has had it's ups and downs, struggling through numerous member changes, people having to leave and come back, periods of time with little to no shows and the long, time consuming process of writing songs and promoting, but WE HAVE FUCKING PERSEVERED THROUGH IT ALL AND ARE STILL ROCKING OUT TO OUR OWN STYLE OF METAL!!! IMPALE is a clear cut definition of dedication, and nothing will stand in our way. Thank you to everyone over the past years, and thank you to everyone now and in the future that has helped IMPALE stay strong. WE WOULD NOT BE HERE IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU GUYS!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Impale">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
