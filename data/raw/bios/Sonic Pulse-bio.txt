Description
Sonic Pulse: Good music for bad people. The foundation of the band is a carefully crafted fusion of the unparalleled virtuosity of Powermetal and the upbeat, fun-loving thrash metal attitude.

Fusing the symphonic virtuosity of epic Power Metal with the fast, aggressive yet fun-loving nature of Thrash Metal, the music of power thrashers SONIC PULSE unleashes a firestorm of both meticulous shredding and savage beer-fueled aggression that will take the listener on an epic journey! SONIC PULE fuse the “beer-fueled thrash metal of TANKARD and the finger-burning speedy power metal of DRAGONFORCE.”

With songs such as “Queen of Beers” and “Bong Zombies”, SONIC PULSE brings forth both lyrical and instrumental genius that will cause listeners to reach for that next beer, pound it and headbang! 
Alongside the endless good times and dauntless adventures that go along with SONIC PULSE, the band has also accomplished quite a lot in a short period of time. In only 6 months of being active, SONIC PULSE has released their debut album, completed a summer tour with LICH KING, been endorsed by SALUDA CYMBALS, BLAKHART GUITARS, and SPEKTOR BASSES, and signed with HORROR PAIN GORE DEATH PRODUCTIONS to release their debut on Vinyl.
