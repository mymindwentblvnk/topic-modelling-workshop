Tempo No Tempo have been a band, in some form, since meeting as students in Berkeley back in 2004. From initial house shows and early home recordings to full tours and features on Pitchfork and I Heart Comix, the band's growth has been on display over three records and countless shows, including dates with the Mae Shi, Panther and the Dodos.

Now working with three sets of hands, the band uses their guitar-drums-bass setup to utilize space, noise and rhythmic counterpoint to create complexity out of their minimal post-post-punk jams. They've grown out of their old indie rock shell, and shifted to something weirder, funkier, and much harder to pinpoint. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tempo+No+Tempo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
