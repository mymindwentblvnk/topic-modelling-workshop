Jones met rapper Doug E. Fresh, who admired her vocal skills and invited her to his Get Fresh Crew tour. She began performing on recordings by such hip-hop artists as Big Pun, AZ, and Common. In 1994, her singles "Where I Wanna Be Boy" and "Don't Front" became popular. Her first and only album, The Other Woman, was released in 1998 through Motown Records.The project featured production from the likes of Mario Winans and Rashad Smith and guest appearances from Mobb Deep and Craig Mack.

The album's lead single was "2 Way Street", which managed to make it to the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at 62. The Other Woman, however, did not perform well and only made it to 51 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. Jones was soon released from Motown and eventually left her music career behind in 2001. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Miss+Jones">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
