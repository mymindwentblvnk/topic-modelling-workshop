Dark Intentions kicked off in late 2002 / early 2003 from their hometown of Breda, the Netherlands. Starting out with writing songs, gradually the style of music evolved into a more modern version of eighties/nineties NY hardcore with thrash/deathmetal influences, resulting in hard and heavy compact songs. The bandmembers come from different musical backgrounds. Bands like Testament, Slayer, Anthrax, Iron Maiden, The Haunted but also Leeway, the Cro-Mags, Biohazard and numerous other artists all have a big influence on their music.

In the period October 2003 - March 2004 the first 3-track demo "Survival is not an option" was recorded by the band as a DIY-project. The demo was well received, the reviews giving the band an indication of where they were. Playing shows throughout the country helped the band to further develop their own style.

In 2005, Dark Intentions recorded a 5 track EP at the Artsound Studio in Belgium that has been released by the new ambitious recordlabel Pure & Simple Records. Numerous good reviews in the press and some 40 shows further, they are now ready to record their debut full-length CD.

The recording will once again be done at the Artsound Studio with Stefan van Neerven (formerly of Born From Pain) as producer.

On the new album Dark Intentions have found their own style; no trends, no bullshit, just aggressive, ultra-heavy hitting songs with strong melodies that will haunt your head.

Recently the band signed to Deity Down Records. Dark Intention's first full length entitled Destined To Burn is in stores as of June 30th of 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Intentions">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
