Progressive metal band currently based out of the Champaign-Urbana area of Illinois after releasing a full-length demo in Texas with a different lineup.  Curt Beeson of Nasty Savage fame played drums for the current demo, and Skott Carino (ex-Death) played bass on one of the tracks before Ken joined the band.  The band is still currently trying to fill out the lineup.
