Rubblebucket was formed after Kalmia Traver and Alex Toth met while attending The University of Vermont. Following graduation, the two were joined by Adam Dotson (trombone, euphonium, vocals), David Cole (drums) and Ian Hersey (electric guitar) and released their self-titled debut in 2009. The group’s second full-length, Omega La La, was produced and mixed by Eric Broucek (Hercules and Love Affair, Classixx, Holy Ghost) and its single “Came Out of A Lady” was chosen as one of the Top 50 Songs of 2011 by Paste. The album was available online for free two months prior to its official release and was downloaded 50,000 times. The band made its television debut on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” in 2012.  Survival Sounds is the band’s label debut and comes on the heels of 2013’s Save Charlie EP and 2012’s Oversaturated EP.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rubblebucket">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
