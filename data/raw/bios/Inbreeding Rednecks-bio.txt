The old-school death metal band INBREEDING REDNECKS are ready to unleash their crushing debut album "Abnormal Life Portrayed"! 

Danish INBREEDING REDNECKS was formed in 2008 and consists of experienced metal musicians from bands like Autumn Leaves, Memorial, Frameless Scar and Mercenary.
After only one EP the band is now ready with the debut album â€œAbnormal Life Portrayedâ€. The album has been under development for the last two years and is recorded at CB Studios by Christian Bonde (Dawn Of Demise etc.) and mixed by Sebastian Wolff from Kellermensch. 

INBREEDING REDNECKS has roots in the seaport Esbjerg and is inspired by "old school" metal and therefore attaches great importance to those areas are the prominent elements of music. Bands like Suffocation, Morbid Angel and Hypocrisy is the source of inspiration as well as modern metallers like Gojira amongst others. 

INBREEDING REDNECKS writes about critical events in society, which are characterized by everyday frustrations and supports it with the brutality of death metal. This universe consists of an equally brutal instrumentation - 90s inspired growl vocals are delivered in a convincing manner, a high technical level on the drums and lyrics with a clear-cut message. The riffs are written with consideration to the simple and harmonious. 

The band pays homage to the old way of making albums, but has found their own way to make it work in today's metal world. With these elements in focus, the band knows that the messages will strike the listener as hard as the songs suggests.
