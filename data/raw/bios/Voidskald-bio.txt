Voidskald is a raw black metal band from Berlin,  Germany. The band members are Eugen Grimken (vocals, lyrics, drums) and Andreas Kratochvil (guitar, bass) . Voidskald primarily concern themselves with atheist supremacy, anti-theism, nihilism (in particular Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra), misanthropy and existentialist thought (mostly Camus) in their music. Heavy distortion, steady blast beat with occasional slow passages and dissonant riffs mark their style. Contrary to many people in the black metal scene they are strongly opposed to all forms of supernaturalist beliefs and theism which usually manifest themselves in the form of satanic and occult imagery. "Whatever connotations black metal music might have nowadays - we fully embrace a scientific view of the world and propagate it by all means possible.", Andreas told BELLVM GERITE in an interview. They work at an incredible speed. According to Eugen their first album, Hermitry, which has a playing length of approximately 43 minutes , was written and recorded in only 8 days.
