Begushkin is the masterwork of Brooklyn's swinging sultan, multi-instrumentalist and masterful songwriter Dan Smith & friends. Begushkin's debut full length Nightly Things is an 8 track journey into a creepy & disturbing surreal nightlife full of enemies, coarse love, and violence delivered with both a manic desperation and deadpanned absurdity that's augmented by Smith's intricate guitar picking & a woman's mournful harmonies. Nightly Things takes the time honored American Gothic themes and recasts them in a witches brew of middle eastern and eastern European musical influences. The result is a beautifully disorienting trek through the wilderness of Smith's disturbing mind like some successor to Michael Hurley's twisted, yet sympathetic Werewolf first introduced some 40 years ago. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Begushkin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
