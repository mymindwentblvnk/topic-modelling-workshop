With the surgical precision of an epidemic needle and the raw, awesome power of an atomic detonation, SOULBREACH’s debut album will add a new flavour to aggressive music. On My Dividing Line the band has managed to combine the ruthless energy, the pinpoint accuracy and the massive ponderosity that is SOULBREACH. 

SOULBREACH arose from the ashes of Swedish thrash metal band Mausoleum in late 2004. With influences such as Slapdash, Meshuggah, Tool, Testament, Soilwork, The Haunted, Nevermore, Iron Maiden, Yngwie Malmsteen, Metallica etc., SOULBREACH are determined to combine excellent musicianship with great songwriting, thus creating the most groundbreaking breach of genres ever.

While performing numerous live shows SOULBREACH quickly earned themselves a reputation of being an outstanding live act. Soon enough it was time to prove their dedication to heavy music by recording their debut album entitled My Dividing Line even before landing a record deal. 

My Dividing Line was recorded in Studio Underground, Västerås (Sweden)
Produced and engineered by Pelle Saether (Terror 2000, Carnal Forge, Steel Attack, Construcdead etc.) Mastered at Unisound by Dan Swanö (Bloodbath, Edge of Sanity, Nightingale).

In 2006 SOULBREACH signed a worldwide deal with the mighty Mascot Records and soon thereafter recorded their debut video for the song Skin Deep from My Dividing Line, produced and directed by Christoffer Glans.

My Dividing Line will mark the dawn of the SOULBREACH-era. Make no mistake about it; SOULBREACH are ready and have their mind set on becoming the next main attraction on the global thrash metal scene. 

Get ready to step into the breach!
