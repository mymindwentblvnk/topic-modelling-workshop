10 KINGDOMS™ started as a solo project of Ellis' next to MindThreat, a thrash metal band he co-founded with Rick Cartwright out of Dallas, TX. After MindThreat folded under the venues insistence that bands follow the flavor of the week (referred to as Grunge) or forget playing their clubs, Ellis was free to put all his time into 10 KINGDOMS™. All he needed was a vocalist.

Ronnie Trent had been si
nging in various bands in Dallas for years, including the highly acclaimed blues/rock band Magic Box. Even though they knew each other from the Dallas music scene, it was through a mutual acquaintance, Michael Kelly (then guitarist for ABSU) that they came together to record the "Knife Through Bone" EP. Trent's soaring, bluesy vocals fit Ellis' sweeping sometimes grandiose songs perfectly. The EP sold quite well over the internet as well as through the then fledgling online stores, exposing the band to a world market for the first time.

10 KINGDOMS™ hopes to have new material out sometime in 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/10+Kingdoms">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
