O’Flynn is a young producer and DJ from London who has been hailed by Boiler Room as “one of dance music’s most prosperous newcomers”.

One of the standout 12 inches of 2015 came in the form of O’Flynn’s debut release; ‘Tyrion’ quickly became a tool that Four Tet rarely left out of his sets, while the anthemic ‘Desmond’s Empire’ won support from Gilles Peterson and was used to soundtrack festivals throughout the summer.

His follow up 'Oberyn / Spyglass' featured more clattering percussion and upfront energy and garnered Radio 1 and Rinse airtime from James Blake and Hessle Audio respectively. Whilst 'Glow Worm / Aloha Ice Jam' was championed by the likes of Bonobo and named by Phonica as one of their "Best Singles of 2016".

Maintaining the pace with remixes for FaltyDL and Addison Groove, and a new release on seminal dance label Ninja Tune, O’Flynn continues to develop as an exciting new name in the electronic dance music scene. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/O%27Flynn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
