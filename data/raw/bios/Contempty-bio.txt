Contempty is a doom/death metal band from Rio Pomba, Minas Gerais, Brazil formed in 2012.
The band started when Joe and Anderson began writing some songs in this style, with lyrics that portrays loneliness and death. After that other musicians join the band and in may of 2012 they did some gigs and played these compositions.

In 2013 the band came back to studio to record their first EP titled ''Gaping Deception in Guiltless Eyes'', with three songs. They hope to release another EP in this year of 2014 and maybe a full album on a near future.
