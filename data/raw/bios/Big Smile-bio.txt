After spending nearly two years building a solid local fan base around Cincinnati, Big Smile released a three-track EP in 2019, titled 'Dependent’. The lead single, “Pillbox Hill,” landed on multiple Spotify playlists such as Pop Punk's Not Dead and The Scene, as well as opened the door for the band to open for national acts such as State Champs, The Dangerous Summer, and Grayscale. After the late 2019 release of their music video for the song 'Oscillate', which premiered on Live Nation's 'The Noise', Big Smile hit the road one last time before signing to Anchor Eighty Four Records in mid-2020.
