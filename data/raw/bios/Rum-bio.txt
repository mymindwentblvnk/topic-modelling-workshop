Rum was probably the first very successul folk group of the Flanders back in the 60s. It consisted of Dirk Van Esbroeck, Paul Rans and Wiet Van de Leest. When Wiet left the group, a new Rum was formed, with Dirk Van Esbroeck, Jean-Pierre Van Hees, Frakke Arn and Juan Masondo. Wiet joined up with Vera Coomans, and Paul Rans went to do his own mostly solo performances, singing accompanied by his lute. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/RUM">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
