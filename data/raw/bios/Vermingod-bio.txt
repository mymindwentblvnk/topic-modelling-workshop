The band started in the summer of 2003, in Patras, Greece.  They were George, Stathis and Jimmy. Two years later (summer of 2005), after lots of changes in the line up, at the second guitar player and the lead singer positions, Fotis joins the band. They recorded two Demo cds and had headline and support live shows. For those two years (2005-untill summer of 2007) the vocalist was George, he was singing and playing guitar in the same time. Now a guy joined the band, called Aris, letting George play the guitar, so Aris will be the lead singer for them, from now on. A year later Fotis is leaving the band for some personal reasons and now Telis takes his place. They recorded their 2008 Demo and in 2010 they released their first self-financed album,The Grand March to Devastation.
