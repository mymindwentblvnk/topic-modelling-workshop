One of the affiliates introduced on the Wu-Tang Killa Bees: The Swarm compilation, this group is composed of Apocalipps, Beno, Iron Mic, Sha Gotti, and Truck, with their production being handled mostly by The Blaquesmiths. Like so many Wu-Tang affiliates, completed an album that was scheduled to be released during the 1997-2000 period but which was continually held back by RZA. Eventually the group were so dissatisfied with this treatment that they cut their Wu-Tang business ties and went independent. However, they are believed to still be on relatively good terms with the Wu-Tang camp. They have since released various mixtapes and solo mixtapes. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ruthless+Bastards">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
