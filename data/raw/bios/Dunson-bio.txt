Dunson, formerly known as Kenton Dunson, resigned from his career as an investment advisor to become a full-time artist in 2010. After spending a multitude of years playing in bands of different genres, the Maryland native took the chance to become a solo artist focusing on lyrics and production. He has since amassed a receptive, global fan-base, proven through hundreds of thousands of downloads of his self-produced Creative Destruction series, among other projects and collaborations.
