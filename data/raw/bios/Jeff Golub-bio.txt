Born in Copley, Ohio, Jeff started playing by emulating 60's blues rock guitarists Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix, etc...Then, following up on the artists that these musicians cited as their inspiration, he delved deeper into the blues listening to Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy, and anyone named King --B.B., King, and Freddie.

Golub was in his teens when he first heard a Wes Montgomery record. This moment set him on a whole new course which led him to study at Berklee College of Music in Boston. From Boston Jeff moved to New York in 1980 where his first major gig was with rocker Billy Squier. Jeff appeared on 7 albums and 3 world tours with Billy. He released his first solo recording, "Unspoken Words" for Gaia Records in 1988 but really embraced his role as band leader and instrumentalist with the release of "Avenue Blue" in 1994 for Mesa Bluemoon/Atlantic records.
