Stygian Apothegm combines the likeness of thrash metal with classical influences with focus on riffs and solos.  Created in 2006 by Mike Byrne and Nate Lumbra (ex-The Knife Trade) and later on recruiting guitarist Sergio Quesada, we tested our luck in the live scene of Georgia and the surrounding Atlanta area. Unfortunately no success was made and within 4 years the band succumbed to exhaustion after so much blood and sweat was poured into the band. Within that time, however, we were able to create one album entitled "The 1000 Year Journey" and Mike Byrne continues on as a solo artist in hopes of one day being recognized as a formidable musician and songwriter in the metal era.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stygian+Apothegm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
