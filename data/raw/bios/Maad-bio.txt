Maad (also known as Maad*Moiselle) is a singer, songwriter, model and a DJ based in New York City. She is no stranger to music and fashion world. After spending recent years modeling for L'oreal, Seventeen, Essence & Anastasia Beverley Hills, along with songwriting alongside the likes of Claude Kelly (Britney Spears, Jason Derulo) & Jared Cotter (Nicki Minaj, Jay Sean), Maad has set her sights on the spotlight with her blossoming solo career. With a forthcoming EP in the works for a 2016 release, Maad is a quadruple threat, steadily becoming a force to be reckoned with.

Following the stunning visual for her song “Black Ice,” Maad returns to continue making her mark on the music scene with the debut of her new single “90s Love” in September 2016. Over smooth and sensual production by HSVN and TheVamp, MAAD sings an ode to head over heels love, with nods to epic, throwback R&B and soul jams.

Look out for MAAD’s forthcoming debut EP, Lé Funk, due out this fall, which includes a collabo with Ro James. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maad">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
