SEASONS OF STORM was formed during the Spring 1999 by songwriter and lead guitarist Johan Lindgren together with his rhythm guitarist colleague Andreas Stenlund. Over the next four years the duo recorded three demos, undergoing several line up changes in the process. The band's fourth demo, 'Face Of The Evernight' fronted by new singer Simon Ã…kesson, arrived in early 2003. Tobias Lundgren would augment the group as new drummer shortly after and this version of the band duly scored a deal with the British based Now & Then label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Seasons+of+Storms">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
