Thoracopagus first started in 2004 when Paul Slagle contacted Sam Stone about joining Sam's then current band which never delivered any releases. After going through many bands in the past such as ECDM (now known as Spill the Blood), Paul decided to move to Sylva in 2004 to Sylva, NC where Sam was located and they began writing sick death metal. They both had the same tastes in music and wanted to create a band which was entirely brutal, no holds barred death metal that encompassed the beliefs of each member. They then decided on trying to find other members for this yet unnamed project which came with fruitful results; Benjie Stewart who is also in Grimmoon soon joined as with Adrian Hornbuckle of Pride Before a Fall fame.

They all decided on using the name "Thoracopagus" which means basically two twins conjoined at the chest. After playing some local shows and releasing a rehearsal demo in 2004, things began to grow stagnant in the music Thoracopagus was playing, so a break was in order. After a break, all the members of Thoracopagus rejoined and decided to give the band another shot, this time changing the musical direction that flows better and more challenging to play, along with picking up a new band member, Adam Russell. Throughout this period, Thoracopagus had many temporary members including Doug Dugan of Cryptic Torment, Adam Ranke of Southern Cross, ex-Pride Before a Fall and ex-Grudge and David Storm of The Zultones and Spill the Blood.

In August of 2006, Benjie and Sam decided to quit due to inner conflicts and lifestyle differences, respectfully, thus leaving Paul and Adam to band duties. Just before Sam quit, Thoracopagus recorded a demo for 2006, which will be released soon! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thoracopagus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
