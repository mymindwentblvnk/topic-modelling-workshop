PCYST was formed in 2005 as a Black Metal project but was originally formed back in 1997 as an Industrial project known by its full name of Polinoidal Cyst. There has been many releases over the years. To inquire about any past release feel free to send me a message or get in touch with me at cyosis@gmail.com. Thanks. -C
