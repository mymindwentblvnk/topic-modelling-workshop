Kania was formed in early September '03 in Lithgow, a small town 150km West of Sydney, Australia. Formed by guitarist/songwritter Marty Warren and vocalist Dan Ellery Kania's sound has been described to possess aggressive guitars riffs, catchy choruses and of course some magical melodies which are the key elements to the young bands already whispered name, with influences from early metal bands such as Amorphis / In Flames through to Insomnium / Ensiferum the band wasted no time in writting and releasing Prophecy in December '03.

The demo recieved much attention from the underground metalscene, and the song Ethereal Skies was chosen to be on the National-wide compilation album Underearthed 2. Kania was now ready to take the live scene by storm. Marty went to drums, Alex Warren took over Lead Guitars and Aaron Staines (Rhythm Guitars) and Pete Knight (Bass Guitars) joined the band to begin rehersing. Although Pete and Aaron left Kania for personal reasons some months later, Simon Holmes (Rhythm Guitars) and Luke Case (Bass Guitars) gave Kania a full line-up to unleash on the live-scene, playing there first live show in August 2004 and have since been playing live shows alongside some of Australia's premier metal acts such as Dungeon / Devolved / Argument Soul (Japan)

With newer, stronger material Kania entered Velvet Studios in October '04 to record a new MCD which would be released in Europe through Cartel Media Records and has since not only caught Australia by suprise, but all over the world reviews for Remorse have been flawless. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kania">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
