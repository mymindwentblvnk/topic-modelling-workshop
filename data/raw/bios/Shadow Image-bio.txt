2nd: Based near Flint Michigan, Shadow Image is a rock duo formed by singer and multi-instrumentalist Harley Mace with partner in crime on keyboards, Mandy Monster. Combining influences ranging from goth, deathrock, post-punk, heavy metal, and classical piano, Shadow Image creates a sound which defies definition and fuses memorable, underground music of the past with dark tones of today. 

Between 2010 and 2012 Harley Mace composed and recorded what would become the group's first self titled EP which would be released on May 22 of that year. With the help of long time friend, Alex Baskel, aiding in additional studio percussion, the tracks Too Much (Could Never be Enough), Before the Dawn and Memento Mori complete the EP and attracted attention to the band worldwide.

After adding Mandy Monster to the lineup on keyboards, the group signed to the legendary Danse Macabre records of Germany and released their first full length album, Kiss the Ashes in May of 2013.

1st: Shadow Image, hailing from the Hudson Valley NY, was formed by brothers Chris and Tom Spadafora in 2001. Well at least the idea of putting together a progressive metal band was created back in 2001. SI is an original progressive metal band ranging from the likes of Symphony X, Dream Theater, Spiral Architect, and Fates Warning. Each member is a true lover of music, influenced not only by their love for metal, but also styles ranging from jazz to the classics. Each member excels in their trade, and brings forth an individual character to the song. Our main integrity as a band is to keep each song distinguishable from the next and to capture our audience in a way that will keep them guessing what we will do next. As time grows, we will grow as musicians, writers, and a band. SI will always remain pure in who and what we are stylistically, regardless of trends.

We have performed with quite a few local and national acts within the tri-state area, including one of our biggest influences SYMPHONY X. Performing live is a challenge for us, and we look forward to sharing the stage with fellow musicians and our audience. That live environment is one of the most intriguing and energizing rushes a musician can feel.

Well we have come along way since 2001, and look forward to what the future will bring. We are psyched about the new line up we have in place. It is the strongest yet in all aspects. So keep tuning in and keep the music alive out there!!!!!
