After a hugely successful 2011, Caveman continued their exciting rise in 2012 and 2013, and are currently touring the United States.

Their new, self-titled album comes out on Fat Possum Records on April 2, 2013 and features the single "In The City" which Pitchfork described as achieving "an anthemic sound by playing to their strengths". 

In 2011, Caveman garnered praise for their debut album CoCo Beware from outlets like NPR, The New York Times, and Fader and for their big sounding, impressive and completely unforgettable live shows alike.  NPR Music charted them as their #7 most favorite live show after seeing them at CMJ in October and named them "Discovery of 2011" in their year-end edition of All Songs Considered.
