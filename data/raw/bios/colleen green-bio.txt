Colleen Green (born 23 October 1984) is an American indie pop musician from Los Angeles, California. 

Green always wears sunglasses onstage. 

Green's first full-length for Hardly Art, Sock it to Me, is grounded in pure pop. Greenâ€™s multi-tracked, emotive vocals take an enormous leap forward, evoking all-time heroes such as Rose Melberg and Tina Weymouth, with every drum-machine-tracked song awash in the dreamy slacker romanticism of California. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Colleen+Green">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
