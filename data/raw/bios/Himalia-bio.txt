Himalia AKA Davee Hinman.
Himalia hails from Lincoln and has only been producing for a couple of years.  Prior to this he was jamming in a few deathcore bands! He has made the crossover in order to experiment with a range of sounds, unfamiliar to him. 
His post electronic music is diverse.  You can hear he enjoys exploring genres and putting his unique spin on sounds.  Himalia’s influences are vast.  He aims to make music to take you on a journey, remind you of a time, a place or hold you in a moment. 
“When I listen to my music it takes me back to a certain time in my life (Himalia, 2014)”.
Stay tuned and enter the ambient, melodic soundscapes of Himalia’s mind!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Himalia">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
