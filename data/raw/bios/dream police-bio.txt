There are several acts called Dream Police.

1. Dream Police was a Norwegian rock band which existed from 1989-1991. The members of the band were: 
Odd Rene Andersen - vocals and harmonica
Trond Holter - guitar and backing vocals
Rino Johanessen - bass and backing vocals
Ole Petter Hansen - drums
          
Odd Rene Andersen is on the artistic side working as an entertainer and singer, some of you may recognize him from TV shows. Trond Holter owns his own studio, Firehouse Studio, where he's working as a producer. He is also playing guitars in the nowadays famous rock band called Wig Wam.
Ole Petter and Rino often play together in different settings, when they are asked.
They also play in a party band called Tante Gørilds Hobbyorkester.

2. Dream Police, psychedelic rock band from Brooklyn, NY, United States, a musical production by Nick Chiericozzi and Mark Perro of the band The Men. The project began in 2010 as a reservoir for ideas which had overflowed from The Men's drain pipe. In that same year, a two-song cassette single was self-released, with a follow-up live document in 2011. Most recently, the duo has conceived an LP with longtime sonic partner, Kyle Keays-Hagerman from late 2013 through early 2014. Although the production began using the most conservative rock and roll devices, it slowly plumed into a cloud of future primitive psychedelia bursting with glimmering electronics and cinematic, vibrato storytelling. Dream Police are brutal, erotic and overlit.

3. A German hardcore band from the 1980s.
