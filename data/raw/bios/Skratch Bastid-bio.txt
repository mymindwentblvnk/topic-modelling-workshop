Paul Murphy a.k.a. Skratch Bastid was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was a nerdy kid obsessed with hip hop and after saving his pennies bought turntables and began to pester dj's to help him learn how to master them. The name was born because often within days of being taught a trick by a dj, Paul would master the skill and excel at it often bringing the words "little bastid" to the lips of his teachers. The name was born. But this is where he begins to define himself from the regular dj's. He dominates the competitive circuit playing in the top 5 at all Canadian Competitions, 2nd at the Cincinatti Scribble Jam. 

Today in 2006, The Bastid,  as he is known, is the top Canadian DJ, one of the most demanded club Dj's because his seamless mixing and incredible skills make him the man to get the party started and going all night long. He currently dj's every Thursday at Montreal Club Blizzart.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Skratch+Bastid">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
