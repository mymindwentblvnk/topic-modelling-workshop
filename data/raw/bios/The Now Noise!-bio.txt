Obscenity's side-project

A crazy symbiosis of Oldstyle Thrash, Death Metal, Punk and Grindcore gets into your limbs. The golden 80s meet contemporary song structures just before the turn of the millenium. 
"Raging Mad Insanity" impresses by catchy record song, spontaneity, Mosh character, banger and hop melodies. 

These gentlemen offer a wide selection of the hardest sounds.
