AEONS OF OLD was formerly known as Anaemica ( 1997-2003 ). Throughout the years the band played Death Metal sometimes with hints of Black Metal and melodic touches were never far away.

2005 marked a new beginning as a sturdy lineup was finally established after a couple of turbulent years. The quintet came to realize a gazillion contemporary metalcore acts popping out of nowhere were actually starting to sound like their music of old. In reaction the band decided to droptune their guitars some more and sought a more straightforward approach in their music, resulting eventually in seemingly simple but effective Death Metal.
