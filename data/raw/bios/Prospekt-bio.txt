Shutter Asylum is available on the free compilation album city of screaming spires: vol 1

Formed in 2007 by guitarist Lee Luland and drummer Blake Richardson, the band Prospekt was unleashed. Lee and Blake forged a sound that would epitomize the Prospekt sound, technical and progressive.

With the addition of bassist Phil Wicker and vocalist Matt Winchester, Prospekt began writing music for their first demo, to be released at the beginning of 2010. The demo features three original compositions, with full artwork by Mattias Noren (Evergrey, Kamelot, John Petrucci), and represents the culmination of a productive year of song writing.

By delicately combining brutal riffs with odd time signatures, the principle of Prospekts music is to create intelligent and atmospheric progressive metal.

We are currently continuing to write and record new songs, as well as rehearse for our up and coming performances...
