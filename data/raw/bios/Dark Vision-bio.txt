DARK VISION were formed in 1996 and have been performing extreme metal ever since, starting of as a heavy/black six piece resulting to a straight death/black quartet nowadays. The demo days from 1996 to 1999 brought up several promo tape recordings, all spread to the underground network marking their first steps in the scene.

DARK VISION recorded their first full length album “Full Moon Shines” during 2000 though its official release came two years later through NMC Records. What followed was a promo track recording in 2004 which was also shot for a video clip (“Signs From Fallen Stars”). Numerous line-up changes slowed all activities until DARK VISION got active again in 2006.

Having a solid four piece line-up, they released a self-financed digipack CD entitled “Bestial Remedy” including 5 tracks revealing their new face; death/black through a modern metal perspective. DARK VISION is a live act and have been on stage since their first days to date, having shared the stage with well established bands like Mayhem, Ancient Rites, Rotting Christ, Kaamos, Devian, Dark Fortress, Septic Flesh and many local underground bands. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Vision">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
