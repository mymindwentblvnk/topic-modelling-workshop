Haeredium is a folk-influenced metal band from Eastern France, whose musical and thematic core is based on the will to integrate folklore-related sounds like accordion, flute, mandolin or bouzouki, and lyrics about nature and philosophy in English, French or even German.
Since its creation in 2009, Haeredium got the opportunity to play on many local venues and is now preparing to cross the borders its local area to the release of their first album, Aurora.
