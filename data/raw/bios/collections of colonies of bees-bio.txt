Since 1998, Chris Rosenau and Jon Mueller have worked together as Collections of Colonies of Bees. As a sidestep to their work in the group Pele (Polyvinyl Records), this arrangement saw them using traditional folk/bluegrass instrumentation combined with modern process and technology, creating a melting pot of style so refreshing, classification became meaningless.

To date, there have been three full-length releases. Their self-titled debut, on the U.K. label The Rosewood Union, gained a surprising amount of media attention, and has since been a highly sought item among collectors. Likewise, their sophomore release, Rance released on the U.S. label Crouton, sold out two complete editions. fa.ce (a and the Meyou EP also released on Crouton, continue to receive press and listener attention. Their limited edition EP Stuck on Sweden's Pillowscars, based on live material they were performing with Jon Minor, was released Winter 2003.

Following the demise of Pele in 2004, Rosenau and Mueller began further developing their work as Collections of Colonies of Bees. With the addition of new member Jon Minor, who was also a member of Pele, the group began to become even more stylistically broad. To engage these changes even further, yet another member joined the group, Jim Schoenecker, whose previous electronic work with Jon Minor over the years brought an even deeper sense of cohesiveness to the overall Bees' sound. As they entered the studio to record their fourth full-length, the revamping of the Bees would lead to one of their most ambitious projects yet, 2004's Customer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Collections+of+Colonies+of+Bees">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
