Bestial Mockery is a Swedish black metal band formed in Uddevalla in 1995 by the quartet of Carl "Master Motors√•g" Bildt, Micke "Doomanfanger" Petersson, Jocke "Christcrusher" and Carl "Warslaughter".[2] The band's stated aim at that time was to "channel perverted lusts for Satanic bloody Metal".[2] Although they split up in 2008, Bestial Mockery released four full-length albums for Metal Blood Music, Osmose and Season of Mist, as well as a large number of stand-alone EPs and shared releases with other underground metal acts. In a review of Slaying the Life in Decibel magazine, a similarity between the band and Nunslaughter was noted.[3] As of November 11, 2011, the band is active again.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bestial+Mockery">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
