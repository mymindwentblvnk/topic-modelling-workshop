I Shalt Become started as a one-man black metal project by S. Holliman in 1995. Holliman recorded two early releases, Wanderings and In the Falling Snow before ending his project, though the latter remained unreleased, save for a bootleg version released as Birkenau. The project lay dormant until 2008 when the project was resumed and a third album containing entirely new material entitled Requiem was released, alongside an official release for In the Falling Snow under the I Shalt Become name.

Despite the common misbelief that I Shalt Become is associated with political beliefs, and more specifically National Socialism, Holliman has officially stated that this band has nothing to do with any political beliefs or ideologies. As a further statement against this, the following line was included in the insert for In the Falling Snow when it was officially released in 2008: "No ideology, no belief...just pained." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/I+Shalt+Become">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
