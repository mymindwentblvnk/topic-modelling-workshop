Paavoharju was a Finnish psychedelic folk musical collective formed in 2000 in Savonlinna, Finland where brothers Lauri and Olli Ainala met Emmi Uimonen, Jenni Koivistoinen and others. Paavoharju's music was the outcome of a long intense study of art and literature, dreams, religious despair and living in dark abandoned places. Their sound was something between Bollywood music, church hymns, beautiful pop tunes and ambient esoteric noises. The music is unlike anything heard on this planet yet still oddly comforting.

Paavoharju released Yhä hämärää in 2005 and a follow-up Laulu laakson kukista was released in 2008. The group disbanded in 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paavoharju">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
