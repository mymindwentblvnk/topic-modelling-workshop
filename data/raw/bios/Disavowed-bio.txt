Disavowed was formed in 1994 as Nocturnal Silence. It was not until 1998, though, that the Dutch Brutal Death Metal unit released its first self-financed studio effort; a demo called Plateau. Soon after, they changed to their current monicker.

Two years later, in 2000, another self-financed demo was released, this one being the three-song Point of Few. The band was then signed to Unique Leader Records. On this largely Brutal Death label, Perceptive Deception was released in June 2001. It was comprised mostly of updated versions of the songs found on both previous releases, all of which dealt with topics atypical to the Brutal Death Metal scene: philosophy, psychology, evolution, human nature, society.

The band's line-up, however, has changed relatively frequently since its first demo. The most recent change occurred in January 2006, when drummer since "Point of Few" Robbert Sulejmanov left the band because of a persistent wrist injury. While the band had recruited another drummer, Dirk Janssen, while he was nursing his injury, it was made clear that Janssen was a temporary replacement. But when the injury didn't heal, Sulejmanov decided to quit both Disavowed and Pyaemia. He was replaced by Romain Goulon, bandmate to two other members of Disavowed in another Dutch Brutal Death unit, Arsebreed. 

Stagnated Existence was released in 2007.

Their drummer issues continued in 2008, as Romain joined Necrophagist and will no longer be able to play for Disavowed due to his busy schedule. The band is currently searching a replacement, and focusing on writing new material.
