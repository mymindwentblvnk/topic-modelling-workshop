Cave Have Rod founded in July, 2011 at Beijing, China. Members in this band all have several years’ experiences of playing extreme metal and band. The music style is deeply influenced by Gronibard. Early year, they create a cartoon epic grind core and a set of songs which tells a very stupid story. Nowadays’ works are tending to gore grind but at the same way, they always add some humorous things on it.
