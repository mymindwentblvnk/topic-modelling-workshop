Bonkaz is a grime artist residing in South London who is perhaps drawing out new boundaries for the next generation of grime artists. with his latest debut single “We Run The Block”, Bonkaz is ready for the public ear. The song is controversial as much as it is inspiring. Since it’s release the street anthem has been going viral. It’s grimey but like Bonkaz says “it is still organic”.
