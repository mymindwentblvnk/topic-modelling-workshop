Few local, independent bands have managed to achieve in their whole life spans what Existem has accomplished in only two years. In that time, theyâ€™ve established themselves as a unique, powerful presence in Kansas City, developing and refining their progressive sound to a finely honed point. Perfectly incorporating soaring melodies, signature riffage and a powerful sense of atmosphere, the four young men have crafted a diverse, instantly identifiable songwriting style. In two years, Existem has also released two studio offerings; the most recent, the full-length Years of Winter, represents the first major statement from the band and explores unconventional territory, further establishing them as true progressives. The future is bright for Existem as they continue to explore new waters of sound. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Existem">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
