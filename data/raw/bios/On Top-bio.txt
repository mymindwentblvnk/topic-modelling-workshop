2 bands by the name on top?

1)  ON TOP is a Rock n' Roll power trio bringing you to the heyday of 80's and back with a brand new sound! Packed with edgy vocals and hard hitting drums, and sealed off with melodic, yet ripping guitar riffs! Most of today's music has nothing to offer the new and old school rockers; WE ARE HERE TO FIX THAT! Check us out live and get a taste of what Rock n' Roll is all about!
