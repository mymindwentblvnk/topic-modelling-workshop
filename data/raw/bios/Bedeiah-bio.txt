Bedeiah (bay-d√©-yah)from Douglas, Arizona is a self dubbed "Pro American USBM" project founded by F.A. Monje. The project was evolved from his previous project called Hell-No, but because of another band having that name, a new name was conceived, and copyrighted under the legal name of the sole member of Bedeiah. Some sub demos were known to be released to a selected few who desired to hear the music. In 2006 "Loving Conviction" was released on  cassette, and later in the year rereleased by GES Records on cd. In 2007, GES Records released the Crucifixion EP. Musical comparisons in similarity include Xasthur, Burzum, and Beherit.
