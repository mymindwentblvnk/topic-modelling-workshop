Daniel Martin Moore is an American singer and songwriter from Cold Spring, Kentucky.

In January 2007, after a stint in the Peace Corps, Moore decided to make a bold move in his music career by sending his unsolicited demo to Sub Pop Records. Moore's pensive yet optimistic songs caught Sub Pop's attention, and he soon had a record deal.

Moore's 2008 debut album, Stray Age, was recorded with the help of several highly regarded artists in Los Angeles, including Petra Haden, Jesca Hoop and producer Joe Chiccarelli. The album's gentle folk style and understated complexity help distinguish Moore as an artist to watch.

In 2010, Moore joined with fellow Kentucky musician Ben Sollee to record an album entitled Dear Companion, which was produced by and also features Jim James of My Morning Jacket and Monsters of Folk.

In 2011, Moore released a gospel album, In the Cool of the Day, which was inspired by an old in-house Steinway piano he played during a studio session at WXVU Radio in Cincinnati. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+Martin+Moore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
