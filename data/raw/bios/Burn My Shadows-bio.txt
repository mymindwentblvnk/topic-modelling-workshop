BURN MY SHADOWS was formed in spring 2008. The band have risen from the ashes of two former bands, the raw German Black Metal band "Groll" and the melodic Death Metal band "Dark Faces". From "Groll" came the members Geri (git.), Chris (git.) and Franz (drums/voc). Chris and Franz were also active with the band DARK FACES, to which Eugen (voc), Bernd (bass) and Jim (keys/synths) belonged to as well. The style of BURN MY SHADOWS can't be simply classified, but in short words it would be described best as "Aesthetic Black Death Metal". BURN MY SHADOWS have played several gigs in Czech Republic with excellent resonance, more shows over Europe are planned the near future. After one and a half years of songwriting and playing live, BURN MY SHADOWS entered the studio in the end of 2009 and startet recording their first album titled "HAVOC" . The refinement and mastering of "HAVOC" was done by Stephan Fimmers (Bass player of NECROPHAGIST and friend of the Band) at Aexxys-Art Studio. Due to the reason, that the members of DARK FACES worked already successful with the label MEDUSA PRODUCTIONS it was appreciated well on both sides to cooperate again, now even with the support of EINHEIT PRODUKTIONEN and their well established distributor SOULFOOD MUSIC. The mighty debut album "HAVOC" will be released in Oct. 2010
