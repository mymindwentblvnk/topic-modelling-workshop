There are multiple artists using this name.
1. Truffle is David Bailey (bass, vocals), Ned Chase (mandolin, guitar, lap steel & vocals), Mike Gendron (drums), Pete Kowalski (percussion) and Dave Gerard (vocals, electric & resonator guitars). Both Dave’s and Ned have been creating music together since 1986. They have performed in all but ten states across the U.S., playing as many as 275 shows in one year. Mike (still the rookie) joined the band with years of experience in 1996; the only lineup change in the band’s history. 

Truffle has achieved widespread popularity by headlining many respected venues as well as sharing the stage with international acts as Little Feat, Phish, The Band, Dave Matthew’s Band, David Lindley, The Radiators, and Blues Traveler to name only a few. Truffle has released five albums and assorted compilations (including “Nervous Laughter” on the November/Sony label) as well as contributing to Gerard’s four solo records; the latest being “The Zoomy Trail”, WSCA’s best local / regional CD of 2009. Their music has also appeared on multiple major motion picture soundtracks. Their latest, “That’s Right” is a collection of songs penned and arranged by all the members ; with quality song writing, memorable melodies and tasty production, it is by far their most mature record to date. 

Their sound, a mix of swampy soul, R&B, Bluegrass, New Orleans grooves, and World music, has been stewing in a pot for years, and is ever changing. Their live show, never dictated by a set list, is eclectic and different every night. You need to experience it for yourself ~ Enjoy!
