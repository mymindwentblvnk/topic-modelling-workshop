Veneratio; Latin meaning, honour, pride or respect.
After forming in Late 2009, the band didn't get properly started until 2010. with a finalised line up in February 2010 , under the name "City Of Ashes", they started off as a meagre Deathcore/Electro band.
After a name change in October 2010, there came a whole Upturning of the band and its direction. A few member changes seen the departure of the original bassist, and the arrival of second guitarist Cal Henely. A huge turnaround in sound, Going from a rather simplistic genre, to a full on progressive Metal sound, infused with technicality, brutality, and elegance. Taking inspiration from a whole host of bands, such as The Boy Will Drown, Rolo Tomassi, Galleons and Painted In Exile its clear where the band want their sound to go.
2011 is going to be a big year for Veneratio, set to record and release an EP with all new material, with a whole new sound nobody has herd from the band before, and numerous gigs on the horizon.
