CRIMSON CULT is an Austrian power metal band formed around former Stygma IV members Günter Maier and Alex Hilzensauer.

After the split of Stygma IV, Günter and Alex always stayed in close contact and never lost the joy of playing music together. With Peter Bachmayer and Walter Stuefer they now found the right musicians for bringing their musical ideas to the point. From stygmaesque power metal to high speed parts and doom parts as well Crimson Cult reflects the preferred music of Günter and Alex.

Joined by the skilled drummer Peter Bachmayer and the outstanding vocalist Walter Stuefer, the band's line-up is finally completed.

Within the first 3 weeks of the existence of Crimson Cult, the band wrote ten new songs which were recorded during autumn 2008.

In January 2009 the label Dockyard 1 Records signs the band. In April 2009 Crimson Cult hits the "Demo of the Month" award in the German magazine "RockHard".

The self titled debut CD was released on May 29th, 2009.

Current line-up:
WALTER STUEFER - Vocals
GÜNTER MAIER - Guitar & Keyboards
ALEX HILZENSAUER - Bass
PETER "BEDA" BACHMAYER - Drums
