Grace Carter was born in 1997 in London and raised in Hove, UK. She grew up listening to the likes of Lauryn Hill and Nina Simone, which is evident in her powerful songwriting, which shows emotional and musical maturity. She began songwriting during her school days, and at the age of fourteen was already performing her own material in public. One year later, Grace had converted her bedroom into a makeshift recording studio and when she reached Music College she taught herself the piano by watching YouTube videos.

Armed with emotionally exposing songs and a once-seen-never-forgotten live presence, 2019 looks set to be Graceâ€™s breakout year. Grace is signed to Top Management, the same management company as Dua Lipa and Lana Del Rey. Her current label is Polydor - home to The 1975 and Ellie Goulding - and SonyATV for publishing. 

BBC Music's Sound of 2019 - in January 2019, Grace took third place in the BBC Music's Sound of 2019, which is compiled from critics, DJs and other music experts to highlight the best new talent for the year ahead.
