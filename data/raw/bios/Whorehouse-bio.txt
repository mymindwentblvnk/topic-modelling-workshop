There are two artists known as Whorehouse
1) trash metal band
2) no wave artist

1) Whorehouse is a thrash metal band formed in 1995 in Cracow. After many personal changes Whorehouse now are: Seba, Krzysiek, Karson, Wlochu.
During these years of underground metal scene existence we`ve played many concerts at small clubs and festivals with many bands such as: Decapitated, Epitome, Gorerotted, Parricide, Sceptic, Atrophia Red Sun, Horrorscope, Patologicum, Totem, Cremaster, Serpentia, Cemetery of Scream and many more...
We've also recorded 3 demos, gave few radio interviews and won some prizes (appreciation of our fans-that`s the best one).
Our music fascinations have a great influance on music we play. Right now we`re working on a brand new material which probably will be recorded this year.

2) One of the monikers Teenage Orphans Club member Gio Orlando operates under, making dance punk, no wave, synth punk, power noise, and industrial music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Whorehouse">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
