D.T.W. (Deeper Than World) originally started back in 1993 and split-up in 1994. They Restarted again in the fall of 2004. Back in the old days, they did around 15 gigs with bands such as Disharmonic Orchestra, Cenotaph, Fleshcrawl, Diarrhoea, Pungent Stench... And recorded two demos, but only one saw the black of the night. They did a bunch of split tapes as well + appear on a international compilation 7'' EP called "Chords of Chaos". Now the band prepares new and fresh songs as well the old classics. Band re-recorded two songs (Anyway & Cepaj Ã¨elo) for New Order compilation (a.k.a. Slovenian Metal Compilation part 2.)
