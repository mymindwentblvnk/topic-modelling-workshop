Evading Downfall was formed by the guitar player Faruk Jazic and vocalist Andrej Merkadic, in September of 2006. as the first band ever for the both of them. After the first rehersal on the 17th of September 2006, Aleksandro Alcantara-Mulaosmanovic joins the band as a drummer and brings in the guitarist Vedad Livnjak. With the band's axis formed, some time after, the bass player Kenan Salihbegovic comes in. With two months of hard work, the band comes out to play live for the first time in Club Bock Sarajevo, as support for hardcore bands Stroj and Pain Zone. Certainly it was a reckless and a risky decision, considering being a young band, in every possible way (the band's members age varies from 17-19) but it had to be done, to see if the direction in which the band is going is good. Anonimous Evading Downfall shocked everyone, featuring the biggest Mosh Pit ever to happen in Club Bock to this day, with the club filled completely, to the last place. So, certainly, it was decided to work more seriously, as harder as possible, as much as possible to find the band's unique sound. In preparation for new songs, the bass player Kenan Salihbegovic leaves the band. So in search for good replacement, as reinforcement comes Denijal Sahinovic. Recently the band changed the bass player, with Sasa Dzino (Festival of Mutilation) taking over the bass duties in order to fully crystalize Evading Downfall sound. On the Saturday night of 29.09.2007. Evading Downfall released Through The Eyes Of A Martyr EP, playing a gig in Club "KUK" to a huge crowd, with every ticket sold out. At the moment Evading Downfall is in the process of making new songs and rehearsing. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Evading+Downfall">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
