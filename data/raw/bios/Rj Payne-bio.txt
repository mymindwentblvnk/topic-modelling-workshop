RJ Payne, formerly known as Reign Man, is a Brooklyn bred, Philly groomed battle rap legend who took Instagram by storm with his "Murder in less than 60 seconds" freestyle series. His sixty second freestyles attracted the attention of Lord Jamar, Pete Rock, Erick Sermon, and Black Thought just to name a few. 

Payne's career took off while performing under the name Reign Man. He was selected as a finalist for MTV’s Making the Band 2 by P Diddy, and six months later won the MTV  MC Battle, landing him a deal with Def Jam Records. Due to unexpected events involving the firing of then Def Jam president, Kevin Liles, Reign Man’s music was unfortunately shelved. He then signed with Jimmy Henchman, one of the most feared in the music industry, until Jimmy’s legal troubles began. 

Reign Man linked with Reed Dollaz back in Philly and joined Top Klass, the city’s largest independent label. He was an integral part of the battle rap DVD era and had a cult following on the internet. His last battle was in 2015 where he won against URL's Ty Law. 

Reign Man decided to drop the stage name and start recording music under his real name – RJ Payne. He joined forces with producer PA Dre and business manager/pr Chrissy Mac to form Educated Ignorance Music Group. He released 21 albums in a span of 3 years and appeared twice on Shade 45 with DJ Kay Slay.

Payne's music has gained national attention from the likes of Eminem and Lil wayne and is now involved in a bidding war for his talents. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/RJ+Payne">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
