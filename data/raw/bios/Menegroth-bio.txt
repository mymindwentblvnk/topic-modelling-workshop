Menegroth is a black metal band that was founded in 2001 in Zurich, Switzerland. They play melodious black metal with lyrical influences from the art of Futurism (Marinetti), war, Gnosticism (inspired by Julius Evola), alchemy and the "Style of Fascism" (Armin Mohler). Their name comes from J. R. R. Tolkien's The Silmarillion, in which Menegroth is a subterranean dwelling place of the Elves.

On the newest album, "Gazourmah," Josef Maria Klumb of Von Thronstahl contributes guest vocals on the song "Mithras Initiation."
