NYN is the solo project of Carthage guitarist Noyan. Blending progressive death metal with a slew of influences, the first EP The Anachronist was released for free. "NYN is a hyper progressive metal sound which will tickle the fancy of anyone who enjoys anything from Trivium to Beyond Creation. The Anachronist has a little bit of everything that you could ask for." - Headbang or GTFO

Work on a full length album is in progress with a tentative late 2013 release date.
