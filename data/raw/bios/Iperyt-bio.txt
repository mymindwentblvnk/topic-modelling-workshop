The idea of modern sinister lethal weapon is now born. Five people and the ultimate weapon ready to unleash aggression, destruction, depravity and all of crying children fears...And then throw them all into mighty fog of IPERYT!! A powerful mixture of furious black metal strongly established in its almost forgotten roots, a touch of death/grind attitude towards guitars and all thrown into the wall of noise from hell called extreme  terror hardcore techno. 

 Such a sick innovation could only be delivered by most uncommon, perverted and psychotic minds gathered together in only one purpose. The purpose of dark art, demolition, devastation and, without
any doubt, strong-hearted consignment.
Iperyt – the band – offers no excuses, asks no compromises and wants nothing but pure extreme emotions.

With Iperyt’s first demo entitled PARTICULAR HATRED, which brings four massive and powerful tracks, the band proves that raw black metal, sick melodies and ultra-fast terrorcore bassdrums can be united under one evil flag. That’s the next step in hellish and brutal, yet still considered and intelligent sound. No matter how you call it: music, noise, metal, terror techno or so on, one thing is certain: IPERYT is prepared to be used.
What’s more: it will be used. Sooner than you imagine.
So whether you like it or not, you’d better be prepared! Because IPERYT takes no prisoners of war.

In the world
where extreme terror meets raw black metal
where there’s no good or evil
where there’s only power and those too weak to seek it
There’s only one
Final Solution

the ultimate deadly weapon
called
IPERYT

Join the warfare!
