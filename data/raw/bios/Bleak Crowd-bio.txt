Bleak Crowd is roaring their guitar based, whiskey-, and smoke smelling heavy rock’n roll with attitude. They are from Oulu, Finland, and they started to rock hard in year 2000. Since the beginning they’ve made songs which are easy to approach, even though their new and more aggressive music contains really unpredictable stuff.

Bleak Crowd is best when they play live, and finally they were able to catch that same spirit in studio for their 2nd album, One shot for the glory. And it really is their one shot. It’s now or never. One shot for a record deal. One shot for stardom. One shot of whiskey, and few shots more.

This is the point where they’ve given everything. Yet there’s still much to give. Drink with the death and live forever!
