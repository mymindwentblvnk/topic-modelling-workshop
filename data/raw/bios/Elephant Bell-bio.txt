ELEPHANT BELL has existed in talks between Tom and Tommy since 1998 but it wasn't until the dawn of new millennium that something really concrete started to happen.

They both played in a band called SHAMOS which played some heavy/funky/stoner/progressive rock. Couple of really hard-driving/rocking/heavy songs were made for SHAMOS but as it turned out some people in the band didn't want them to go that way so they ditched the songs.

After couple of weeks they just returned to the songs while having some fun at the rehearsal place. There were only Tom, Tommy and Mike (the drummer of SHAMOS) present and they started jamming. After a couple of minutes they were raving in the rehearsal room and really couldn't stop. The music rocked like a 3-legged moose on ecstacy! After that session they decided that they HAD to continue with those songs so they decided to form new band. Jason was recruited as bassist and so ELEPHANT BELL was born.

After some hiatus band has returned in full swing for the 2006. Band relocated to the Helsinki-area and were forced to find a new bassplayer. Enter Willie Rooster... He's and old friend from the freak-out Lappeenranta and one hell of a bassplayer so it wasn't too hard to let him to handle the low-end duties from now on. The rock continues...

New low-end rumbling man entered the picture in the beginning of 2008. J.J. Strangler is his name and he'll continue the rock!
