Polkov is an indie/folk/rock collective from Austria. Formed in 2012, they currently operate as a 6-piece band with Laurenz Jandl, Paul Pfleger, Juergen Schmidt, Guenther Paulitsch, Alex Hackl, and Florentina Finder. Their songs often combine alternative rock, pop and country elements with three-part folk harmonies and witty lyrics about coming of age, sci-fi, physics, romance and video games. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Polkov">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
