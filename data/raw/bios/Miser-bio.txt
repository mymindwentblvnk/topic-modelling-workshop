Miser formed in December of 2005. Each member of Miser is a product of a previously successful and great talent within the Dallas music scene, from which they have gained immense growth and experience in the music industry. Members of Miser have had the honor of sharing the stage with several great acts such as Jimmy Eat World, 311, Weezer, Hoobastank, Seether, Bowling for Soup, Slow Roosevelt, Edgewater, 30 Seconds to Mars and numerous others. With previous projects reaching their final chapters, members of Miser found themselves at a crossroad. Where for most the crossroads mark the end; for Miser it is only the beginning.

Miser blends heavy-hitting rock and textured melodies with memorable hooks and a moving message. The solid foundation is created by the thunderous drums of Moonshine and the quaking bass sound of Nick Holmes. This foundation is complimented by the tone and fury provided by guitarist Mark Sims and the timeless melody of guitarist Shannon Nedved. Completing this unit is the rich and beautiful vocal message offered by Miser singer and frontman, Coach. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Miser">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
