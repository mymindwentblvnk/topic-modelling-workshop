Documents issued in vanishing inks faded into old pawn tickets. New documents were constantly required. The citizens rushed from bureau to another in a frenzied attempt to meet impossible deadlines.
   All benches were removed from the city, all fountains were turned off, all flowers and trees destroyed. Huge electric buzzers on the top of every apartment house (everyone lined in apartments) rang the quarter hour. Often the vibrations would throw people out of bed. Searchlights played over the town all night (no one was permitted to use shades, curtains, shutters or blinds).
