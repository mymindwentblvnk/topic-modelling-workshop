Makthaverskan is a Swedish post-punk band from Gothenburg, Sweden. The band layers aspects of noise, jangle and dream pop on a foundation of rambling, garage-punk energy. Distorted, uptempo riffs ebb and flow with laid back, atmospheric post punk throughout the tracks that make up the band’s sophomore LP ‘II’ on Run for Cover Records. Sonic bursts of anthemic pop are accentuated and brought to life by front-woman Maja Milner’s sharp and soaring delivery, cutting through layers of reverb to air out her dirty laundry.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Makthaverskan">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
