2) A powerviolence band from San Diego, CA (http://fuckingcrutch.bandcamp.com/)

3)The band Crutch, now known as Aletheian, hails from Lebanon, PA and plays progressive death metal. The lyrics reveal Crutch to be a Christian band, dealing primarily with awe and love of God. In keeping with death metal tradition, however, the positive attitude is expressed through violent imagery and extensive metaphor. The debut CD ...hope prevails was the only one released under the name Crutch; both subsequent releases, Apolutrosis and Dying Vine, are under Aletheian. The band's homepage is www.aletheian.com.
