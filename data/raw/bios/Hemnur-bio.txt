A dark bleak primitive horror spits forth a grim brand of raw old school necro black 'n roll metal. Carving another mark into the supreme Norwegian extreme music history. The name of this horror is HemnuR. Minimalistic, relentless and raw as fuck!!. With their dirty catchy riffs... solid, yet primitive drums and hideous black metal shrieks, they sound as cold and ugly as a bloody decaying maggot infested corpse looks. 

This blackened project was founded in the year 2004 by Frediablo, better known from such bands as Grimfist, Necrophagia and Gorelord. 

Fueled by his love for mother nature, horror and primitive music, he set it upon himself to create a project where he could get all his darker and primitive musical ideas out of his system. 

During this process, second and only other member of Hemnur joined the ranks. Her name is Aina aka Heksblod, and together they have thus far recorded one demo and one full length album. 

Their demo "Ravnsvart" was recorded in Pinhead Studios, 2004. This was co-produced by Frediablo's brother and Necrophagia axeman Fug, and contained six tracks of lo-fi black metal. 

Their debut album "Satanic Hellride" was recorded in GodFed Studios, March/April 2005, and was released via the dutch label Infernus Rex, August 2005. In the light of it's release, "Satanic Hellride" has hailed many great reviews worldwide, and the HemnuR duo will return to GodFed Studio to begin the recording of their sophomore album "Kalde Faen". 

Expext nothing but another vulgar blackened anti-religious hellride!! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hemnur">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
