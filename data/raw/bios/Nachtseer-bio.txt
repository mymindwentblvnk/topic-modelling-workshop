Nachtseer, is a band from New Jersey that incorporates different styles of black metal. The band started out as a guitar player and a vocalist in 2003-2004. In 2007 the band became more serious and a drummer and 2nd guitar player joined. The bands first demo with this lineup is completed and the band is working on releasing it. 

The sound of Nachtseer is very unique. A rush of atmospheric, epic, and sometimes doomish black metal, pelts the listeners ears. The vocals are of excellent quality and vary in pitch. The guitar playing can be described as very atmospheric. The lyrics mostly have to do with fantasy, battles, and other philosophical topics.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nachtseer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
