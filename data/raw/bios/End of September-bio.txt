The history of End of September began in Sweden 2009 when founder Erik Tordsson started to write songs on his own. Erik was familiar with the scene and had played in extreme metal and hard rock bands before, but this time he created something different, something that would become the sound of End of September. A demo was recorded together with vocalist Victoria Sundberg, and the demo got the band a deal with Sweden’s Ulterium Records. Shortly after the recordings Victoria left the band, which resulted in a two year hiatus for End of September.

During 2011 Erik finally found the new vocalist Elin Redin to replace Victoria, and shortly after that also Johan Nöjd (bass) and Johan Svensson (drums) joined the band, and the line-up was complete.

End of September is definitely one of the most promising bands from Scandinavia at the moment. This young band shows with their debut album that they know how to create fantastic, memorable songs, and perform them to perfection. They have also been able to successfully create a mix between melodic metal and more modern metal that not many bands have.

With the well-crafted and intelligent song-writing of Erik Tordsson and the smooth and emotional vocals of Elin Redin, End of September is a force to be reckoned with during the coming years. The band is hungry to hit the stages around the world, and are destined to make it.
