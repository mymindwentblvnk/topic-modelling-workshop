Foul Remains was a Canadian death metal band from Cambridge Ontario that was created in 2005. Brian Riddell (Guitars & Vocals) and Arend Nijhuis (Drums & Vocals) broke off from their previous Death-Thrash project 'Serrated' in mid-October, 2005 to make Foul Remains. The band brought in bassist Jared Riddell after a few weeks to play the band's debut show. Once FR had already gained close supporters, all who were awaiting a release, so after only 2 months from forming the band, Foul Remains went to Preston Music Studios to record their first demo over the holiday season. 'Desecration of Divinity' was complete and released in the new year.

After the demo was completed, support came from local bands that led to FR's start at the live music scene. The band has played shows both in and out of town, bringing in fans from all over.

With more and more people listening to the band, they could not ride out their 2 track demo much longer. They decided to go to the studio again in 2006, this time, to record a single "26 Pieces" (released summer 2006).

Throughout the next year or so, the band played some of their biggest shows. Come March 2007, FR went back into the studio, this time to record 4 fresh tracks. A month later, Foul Remains released its "Demo Anthology" which included all of their past demos as well as the 4 fresh tracks.

After playing together for a few months after their last release, the FR boys became weary of the band and genre as well as what seemed to be a dying metal scene. Foul Remains was put in the gutter in September 2007. As of right now, the guys are changing direction and focus onto a new more diverse type of music. More updates to come as to any new projects. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Foul+Remains">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
