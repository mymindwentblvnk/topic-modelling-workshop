There are, at least, four bands known as Artery: 1) A Sheffield, UK post-punk band. 2) Bulgarian balkan metal band. 3) A USA death metal / thrash metal / grindcore band. 4) A German band.

1) A Sheffield post-punk band (aka The) - influential in the 80s scene, though they didn't sell many records & are often overlooked in pop histories. Chiefly active 1978 to '85 (gigs were riotous), they recorded three studio albums, one live & a several singles - Their latest release is Civilisation (2011).

They are: Mark Gouldthorpe (vocals / guitar), Michael Fidler (vocals / guitar - aka Fidler) & Gary Wilson (drums) & Neil Mackenzie (bass). Former members include Simon Hinkler (keyboards - also with Pulp & The Misson).

They helped define a post-industrial outlook - within which, Sheffield contemporaries, The Human League, Cabaret Voltaire & Clock DVA went on the achieve greater commercial success. They are the reason Jarvis Cocker became a pop star.

3) A central Pennsylvanian death metal / thrash metal / grindcore band. They formed in the middle of 2007, and played few shows. After writing a large amount of material, they recorded their first (and likely their only) album in the fall of 2008. Despite the vast amount of material written by the band, only 8 tracks were chosen to be found on the album. Members of Artery include:

Taylor Nordberg: Bass, vocals and guitar
William "Max" Scott: Guitars
Tyler Gearhart: Drums.

Due to distance issues because of attending college, the members of Artery went their separate ways after recording the album. Potentially, the band could reform when the songwriter, Taylor Nordberg, returns from Florida. However, the bands future is uncertain at this point. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Artery">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
