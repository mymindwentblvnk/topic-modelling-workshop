The German stoner doom trio "WhiteBuzz" formed in the fall of 2006 from various other projects. Cris (guitar / vocals), Andr√© (bass) and Tim (drums) have been performing as a trio since the beginning of 2007.

Aside from the stoner-, doom- and drone elements, the prevailing heavy and buzzing sound is often completed with psychedelic passages.

In early 2009 the band released their debut album, "Book Of Whyte", which was recorded in the winter of 2007 in the band Hermelin's rehersal room.

With 5 tracks and a length of more than 60 minutes, the album represents the self-defined concept of the band which they are continiously refining to merge an arrangement of single tracks into a single, overarching composition.

In April 2009 the band signed to the American label  "Meteorcity" (Unida, The Obesssed, Nebula, etc.).
