From out of the shadows of Europa’s past, when a man’s honor was won by steel and sweat, there was a time when the legions marched to war under the sign of a horned god, and brought down all who sought their people’s freedom. It was from this time that a battle cry of “METAL!” is heard, and the legions shall march forth and conquer! Among them, four warriors from the northern islands bring axe, drums and voice to the fray! Taking influence from the warriors of traditional metal and the folk music of their ancestors, Lunarium is a powerful new force on the traditional metal stage. With bardic, epic, and often thought-provoking lyrics; stellar vocals, heavy, intertwining guitars; powerful drumming, splendid songwriting(without sounding formulaic or commercial), and savage, energetic live shows, Lunarium’s Celtic battle anthems are a fresh take on True Metal. Let the beer flow, the heads bang, and the air crackle with magick! Posers, corporate trend-mongers, and commercial music whores will die upon our Celtic Steel!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lunarium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
