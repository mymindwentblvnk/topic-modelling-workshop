1) Crimson Death is a Toronto-based Jungle DJ, whose music is influenced by the sounds and imagery of Black Metal. Known for his extreme studio creations, unique covers and high energy remixes, he seamlessly blends elements of opposing genres into dynamic dance-floor anthems. The music can be categorized as technically complex drum and bass reinforced through "wall of sound" drum programing. Dark, distorted bass lines and layers of cold ambience are accompanied by haunting, vocals delivering otherworldly lyrics which focus on all aspects of perceived reality and experienced emotion within the collective sub-concious. DJ Crimson Death began his experiments in the art of music construction and manipulation while a student at Fanshawe College in London Ontario. Long hours in the studio interrupted only by frequent live performances resulted in a project called Fetus In A Can: A mesh of traditional black metal and punk using experimental instrumentation and textures. After college Crimson recorded a series of experimental EBM tracks using samples, turntables and computer programming.  In time, his metal sound began creeping into these recordings. Crimson became the world's first black metal DJ, a pioneer in what is now frequently called "Grave Music" (A cross between Goth and Rave). A club set by DJ Crimson Death usually features a blend of original track elements with live vocals and breaks. He has also been known to perform "mainstream" DJ sets on occasion, though still donning his trademark spikes and corpse paint (in tribute to his Norwegian Metal influences). In October of 2006 Crimson released SubMerge, his first commercial dance single (pressed in limited edition red vinyl). It met with critical aclaim and quickly sold out of record stores in Canada and Europe. Now signed to the Brighton UK based EDM label EML Recordings.
