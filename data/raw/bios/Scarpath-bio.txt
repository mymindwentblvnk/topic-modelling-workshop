Scarpath was founded in the summer of 2010 as an old school death metal band. After the debut demo "Left To Rot" (2011) the original lineup split up, leaving guitarist Tero Terorizt Illi (ex-Exremains) as the sole member of the band for a while. Having several song ideas but no band to play them with Illi kept on searching for new members and finally joined forces with drummer Jouni Kurikka (also in Anger Cell) in late 2012. Guitarist Jari Yrjänäinen joined the band a bit later and once they had worked a bit with the song ideas Jarno Taskula (Evemaster, ex-Spirit Disease etc.) agreed to join the band. In May 2013 second demo "Reborn" was released with Yrjänäinen playing both guitar and bass. The band kept on writing new material and eventually the four-piece began recording their debut album in the spring of 2014. Instead of Yrjänäinen they wanted someone else to arrange and play the bass parts on the album. Mika Sallanen (Spirit Disease, ex-Exremains etc.) originally agreed to help his old friends in the studio but eventually ended up becoming the fifth member of Scarpath.

Musically the band has quite obviously developed a lot during the years since their first demo and on the debut album you can basically hear a thrash metal band with some death metal influences. The current line-up consists of a bunch of very experienced metal veterans.

The debut album "Scarpath" containing eight songs was released on March 15, 2015 by Mun Records, Finland.
