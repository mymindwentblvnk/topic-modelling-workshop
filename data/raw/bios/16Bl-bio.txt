Peter Kriek and Ariaan Olieroock had been making music on their own for some time before joining forces and becoming 16 Bit Lolitas in 2003. This collaboration quickly produced a wave of releases. Tracks such as The Puppet Show, Destiny, My Lexicon, Stereo Control and the epic Sednaa quickly followed on labels as diverse as Yoshitoshi, Alternative Route , Release, Sadie, Plastic Fantastic, Nu Republic, Armada, Minimal, DK and LMR. They then decided to keep control of most of their material starting their own successful imprint “Bits & Pieces” shooting off club hit after hit. 

A hectic few years has propelled the boys into the spotlight where their crisp creations have carved out a sound that is both cool and sophisticated. It embraces all that is good about House music.

Peter and Ariaan consistently turn in tight productions that stand out in a crowded market place. Each piece of electronic music is patiently crafted and produced with emotion and care. It’s music that creates atmospheres as well as delivering a killer blow without the need of resorting to overused and obvious gimmicks.

At the end of 2008 the 16 Bit Lolitas released their first ultimate collection of music when they launched the “Live At Warung” mix album series, from Brazil’s ultimate Beach Club on Hope Recordings/Bits and Pieces. It featured upfront underground sounds, handpicked from across the globe to add a shimmer but also featured a large proportion (in fact one whole disc) of their own unreleased material. 

Why? Well speak to Ariaan about his DJ sets and he’ll tell you that they often write material just for this purpose, more than able to nail the mood required in the studio and then put their money where their mouth is at the club. Many DJs will play some of their own productions but not whole sets of it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/16Bl">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
