Official biography:

"Ardual, hailing from Jyväskylä, Finland, was formed in late 2003 by Anssi Temonen, Pyry Mäkinen and Tomi Fagerlund. Our goal was to create dramatic, dark and epic metal. Ardual's first official release was a demo called Birth of a Ravager. It was released in summer 2005. Birth of... was recorded, mixed and mastered by us (except for the drums, which were recorded in Studio Watercastle). 

After releasing our demo we had a few line-up changes and a few gigs. Our second demo, titled Preserved in Beasts, was recorded in Studio Watercastle by Arttu Sarvanne in June 2007. It has a more intense and technical approach, without losing the epic and atmospheric touch of Ardual. Where Birth of a Ravager was composed only by Pyry, now Kimmo and Ville has taken a major part in songwriting too. Now we are stronger than ever, rehearsing new material for following releases, and new gigs." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ardual">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
