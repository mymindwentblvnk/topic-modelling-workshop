14. Grunge may not have yet become a universal language, but it's translated credibly enough for Montreal's Bliss (Colin Burnett, David Bryant, Michael Stevenson, Sylvain Bouthilliette), whose "Grafted to an Elbow" (1993) is 11 tracks of grinding post-melodic post-punk. Produced by Chicago rancor-rock godfather Steve Albini, "Grafted to an Elbow" is oblique yet vehement, its unease with contemporary society conveyed more by TV- damaged titles like "Nature's Gentle Regulator" than by the cryptic, fragmentary lyrics spit out by David Bryant (Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Set Fires To Flames).
