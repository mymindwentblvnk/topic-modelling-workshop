In 2008 two young men met each other and discovered that they are both guitarists with similar music tastes, both trying to create own band.. and so they did. 
That's how Evil Unleashed was started.. in Minsk, Belarus.
They soon found a bassist and a vocalist (both their friends).. and a bit later a drummer showed up.
They've been working hard whole 2008 year and came up with their debut album in 2009 called "Curse of Life". 
The band've already played some shows in Minsk, their hometown and currently working on new material, getting ready to play more shows.
