Sola Svartnar is a raw pagan black metal band from Ar√®s, France. It was formed in 2004. The only member is Terrenus, and he plays all the instruments, with the vocals. The name "Sola Svartnar" is inspired from the lyrics of Enslaved's Blodhemn album, in the song "I Lenker Til Ragnarok".
The group released two demos, Ombre (2004) and Sidera (2005). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sola+Svartnar">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
