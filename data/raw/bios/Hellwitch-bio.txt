HELLWITCH arose from the depths in October of 1984. Founding members Patrick Ranieri and Harry Tyler recorded the first demo, a one track venture, in the living room of their apartment in Gainesville, Floridia.
Pat composed the music and the two of them penned the lyrics. 

In February 1985 Dave Silverstein and Andy Adcock joined HELLWITCH ranks; Pat took on vocals, Andy became the bassist, and Dave replaced Harry on drums. HELLWITCH has played with various established bands such as ANTHRAX, NUCLEAR ASSAULT, D.R.I, KREATOR, DEICIDE, MORBID ANGEL, DEATH, DARK ANGEL, CORONER, GBH, NASTY SAVAGE, and ATHEIST.

HELLWITCH recorded their first studio demo entitled, "Transgressive sentience" in January 1986.  The band's second studio demo, "Mordirivial disemanation" was released in June 1987.
In July of 1988, Pat relocated to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida and began auditioning bassists and drummers. A new line-up consisting of Pat on guitars and vocals, Frank Watkins on bass, and Steve Rincon on drums, released a rehearsal/demo in March of 1989. 

Soonafter, that line-up folded and Pat recruited drummer Joe "Witch" Schnessel, and bassist Tommy Mouser. In June 1989, Flight 19 Records released a 7 inch single featuring two tracks from the "M.D." demo, that quickly sold out. In October 1989, HELLWITCH approached Wild Rags Records and negotiated for the release of the band's first full length LP, "Syzygial miscreancy". The album, released in December of 1990. The LP was recorded at Morrisound Studios with veteran producer Scott Burns and has sold over 10.000 copies world wide.

In late 1990, the band completed successful tours of New Jersey and Wisconsin, and then in February 1991, a 4 date tour of Texas.

HELLWITCH acquired bassist Craig Shattuck. A new 3 song E.P.  Terraasymmetry which was recorded in August 1991 at Morrisound for Wild Rags. This work, released in 1992, shows the band's extreme level of song composition. "Terraasymmetry" has sold 3,000-4,000 copies worldwide. In March of 1992, Joe "Witch" Schnessel left the band. The band cut all ties with Wild Rags Records in September of 1992. The "Anthropophagi" demo was released in November of 1994.

Mid 90s Ranieri called it quits, only resurrecting the group for occasional one-off gigs until 2005 when a new EP entitled The Epitome of Disgrace unexpectedly saw the light of day. In 2007 the band fully resurrected and started writing new songs, signed with Xtreem Records and a new album “Omnipotent convocation” is in the works. The new album was released in the Fall of 2009. In the same period the band's debut album "Syzygial miscreancy" was reissued by Displeased Records and contains 12 bonus tracks (all pre-album demos and EPs). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hellwitch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
