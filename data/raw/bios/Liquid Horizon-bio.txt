Founded in the year 2000 LIQUID HORIZON is a progressive Metal band whose main influences include Savatage, Dokken, Vanden Plas and Dream Theater. So here’s what this is all about: Powerful music with a pumping beat, melodic vocal lines, heavy guitar riffing and spheric keyboards.
After publishing 2 EPs LIQUID HORIZON produced their first full length album ’Urban Legends’ in the year 2005. This record was followed by ‘Revolutions’ in 2007– a concept album portraying revolutions and struggles for freedom in the history of mankind. A trilogy in 20 minutes about the French Revolution is the climax of this record. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Liquid+Horizon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
