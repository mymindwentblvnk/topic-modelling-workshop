A Finnish brutal death/deathgrind formation Torsofuck came into being in 1995 and had been active for four years, during which recorded the High Level Cannibalistic Violence demotape, before split-up. Two years after, somewhen around 2001, they reunited for recording a split CD with Lymphatic Phlegm and then let up again. However, some time later they were offered by 'Goregiastic Records' a contract to sign, and eventually it turned out to a first full-length, the 2004's Erotic Diarrhea Fantasy album.
