Project Viking/Black Metal born in Reggio Calabria, Italy in 2010. The music is strongly influenced by the nature, the seasons and the weather. The lyrics serve as hymns to nature and as message against the current human society. The only work, for now, is a Demo released on 21th Dicember, titled "Solstizio d'Inverno" (Winter Solstice).
