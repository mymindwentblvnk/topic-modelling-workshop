Kess’khtak -pronounce Kessertak- was formed at the end of 2007 in Geneva, Switzerland. 

After a split with the French Juggernaut and a EP, “May Not Be the One You Want”, KSK is back in 2013 with a new full length named “Nurturing Conditions for Rupture”.

The band plays a rough Grind-Death tainted with furious groovy HxC parts. KSK’s proven reputation owes in part to the two singers and the epileptic dynamic they bring to the band.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kess%27khtak">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
