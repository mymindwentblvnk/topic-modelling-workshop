Temple Of Gnosis is dark doom metal project, playing alchemical, occult death doom metal". The concept is inspired by the Western esoteric tradition, especially the alchemical process of Enlightenment and within that, the first stage of the alchemical work called "deconstruction." Music is a peculiar combination of dark ambient, doom riffs and death metal vocals, all supported by dark symphonies.

Temple Of Gnosis represents a dark spawn of alchemical process known as nigredo, or blackening, the first step in transformation of the soul, leading towards the Enlightment and transcendence of the spirit to a Divine level. The alchemical force that reaches the physical plane in the form of sound can be described as a combination of death/doom metal, symphonic nightly orchestrals and dark ambient, all transposed under the Great sign of the Gnosis, empowered by the esoteric & occult archetypes. Temple Of Gnosis is an emblem for an Age to come, an Age of Great Decisions & Judgement which only the few wise ones shall survive.
