Gunnar Johnsén is a Swedish producer and musician better known as Alan Ellis, signed to Epidemic Sound.
Gunnar well-known for his relaxed style of ambient music. He is often featured on Spotify playlists like Ambient Chill and Deep Sleep, etc.

"Growing up in Härnösand, he spent his young years subconsciously soaking up his father’s music taste in the car and around the house. After encouragement from his family to take piano lessons, Gunnar soon discovered he could memorize pieces by ear instead of sight reading the music. This innate understanding also helped him to pick up the drums, which he played for 10 years in a punk band performing predominantly in his native Sweden, as well as touring in Canada." - bio from Spotify page. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Alan+Ellis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
