Early 1970s psychedelic fusion Krautrock band from Germany. They released only an LP (selftitled, 1972) full of haunting melodies, swirling, wailing Farfisa organ, guitars, sparkling piano, bass and drums, and - in opposite to most other private Krautrock LPs - superb vocals.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oratorium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
