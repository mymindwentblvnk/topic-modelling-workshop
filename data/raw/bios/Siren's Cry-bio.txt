Siren's Cry is the closest thing to a female-fronted Symphony X that the world will ever seeâ€”I don't think a sex change is on Russell Allen's to-do list. Siren's Cry is an Austrian group and they show a magical amount of coherent songwriting and surprising instrumental performances throughout. Stylistically, Siren's Cry takes copious amounts of influence from early Symphony X (think "The Divine Wings of Tragedy" through "V") and some fellow Austrian exports such as Edenbridge, obviously including dazzling guitar work, elegant keyboards, and other authentic qualities of the progressive power metal regime. Fronted by one Katarina Bilak, Siren's Cry makes the grass a little greener, the wings of tragedy a bit more divine. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Siren%27s+Cry">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
