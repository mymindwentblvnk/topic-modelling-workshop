“Crawling, climbing my way out of the void”

The symbolism cannot be greater when listening to the chorus of the song “Out Of The Void”, as it fully describes whatSense vs Sanity is about.

Sense vs Sanity is a progressive / melodic death metal project led by Sander Stegeman. Sander hails from the Netherlands. He is a composer, singer, guitarist and bassist. (also known for his bass playing in Disintegrate.)

The music sounds like accessible death metal with progressive and melodic influences and provides a heavy sound that offers layers of complexity underneath. The record also houses unexpected styles such as Drum ‘n Bass and Electronica and will be offering a host of guest musicians which all provide their own musical color to the mix.

Sander started Sense vs Sanity in 2010 as a reaction to former band Posthuman in which he provided guitars & vocals. They released their debut EP “Into The Void” in 2010 which lyrically represented a darker period in Sander’s life. After Posthuman disbanded, Sander decided to follow up on this EP to part with this period.

He took his time to re-evaluate the life he was living and decided to change things. New music soon came to him and a new concept was born. This material turned into the concept album “Out Of The Void” which will be Sense vs Sanity’s debut release.

Sense vs Sanity is not only a studio project, but also very capable of performing a full live performance. After Sense vs Sanity released “Out Of The Void” in march 2013, They already did a lot of successfull shows! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sense+vs+Sanity">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
