Shotgun Cure is a 4 piece thrash metal band hailing from Toronto, Canada. The quartet formed in early 2006, with heavy aspirations of making a name for themselves in the local metal music scene. Since then the band has come out with all guns blazing and striven to go beyond their local acclaim and do whatever it takes to gain the greatest possible success out of their music.

The band was founded by old school friends Rob Dallakyan and Harut Savchenko, who initially set a local jam session which resulted in the recruiting of bass axeman James Tulloch. After many months of song writing, gigging, and lineup changes Shotgun Cure finally parted ways with Rob Dallakyan and introduced full time drummer Kyle Lecourt, whose skills would propel the band to take their music to a new level of precision and tightness. Sound wise, the band strives to be sharp and aggressive, while at the same time providing a compelling dose of melody and rhythm. While it is heavily influenced by the makings of Thrash Metal, the band does not limit itself to any type of genre, and derives influence from many forms of newer as well as older music.

In August of 2009, the band recorded their first EP “Depravity Unleashed,” and with its release plans on spreading its name with as many shows and tours as possible. With the music and aspirations being stronger than ever, Shotgun Cure greatly looks forward to its future as a band. In conclusion, watch this band because you never know when you’ll get a spear in the back. (All good plans need a spear.)
