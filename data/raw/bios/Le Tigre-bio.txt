Le Tigre (/ləˈtiːɡrə/) was an electronic rock band formed in 1998 in New York City, coming out of the riot grrl movement. Members were vocalist Kathleen Hanna (formerly of punk rock band Bikini Kill), guitarist Johanna Fateman, and Sadie Benning; producer JD Samson joined in 2001. 

Le Tigre was known for its left-wing politics and feminist lyrics, as well as adding multimedia and performance art to their live shows. As of 2010, Kathleen Hanna now plays in The Julie Ruin. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Le+Tigre">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
