The band was formed in 2006 with the purpose of playing old school death metal with Death, Atheist, Pestilence, Cynic and other progressive death metal acts being the main influences. Shortly after the lineup became stable, they began writing original material, which resulted in the band's first 3-song demo called Iron Discipline in late 2007, early 2008. Later that year the debut album Taste Smashed To Pieces (released in 2009) was recorded, and received very good critical acclaim, getting the "Best Metal Debut Album of 2009" title at Hungarian Metal Awards. A tour supporting the album began in  late 2009, Keeper Of Dreams played gigs supporting Danish thrash legends Artillery, a lot of shows in Hungary and even got the opportunity to open for former Judas Priest singer Tim 'Ripper' Owens, doing a live world premiere of Charred Walls Of The Damned's Ghost Town as Ripper's backing band. A music video was also shot for Synesthesia off the debut album.
 A second album is planned to be recorded later in 2011 for which they are in search of a label.
