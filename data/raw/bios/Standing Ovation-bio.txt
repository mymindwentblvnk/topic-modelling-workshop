Standing Ovation mixes genres skillfully, gluing everything together with a heavy, metallic touch and their own rugged style. The band's strength is that they don't really sound like any other band. Their music is a must-hear for fans of progressive music with metal elements.

Standing Ovation’s seed was laid somewhere in 2006. Their debut EP “Scars Suit Me” was self-released in the beginning of 2011. The EP got global recognition and in Finland, among good press, it was also voted as the 3rd best self-released record in the “Finnish Metal Awards”. Soon after that the process of their full-length album began.

Standing Ovation's anticipated debut full-length, which goes by the name "The Antikythera Mechanism”, has now seen the daylight. The album partly deals with the ancient, highly sophisticated machine and the story is spiced with historical and science fiction elements. The album also has a wide range of surely surprising songs and themes.

Reviews have already praised this album worldwide. Let’s hope that it will reach you too!

Enjoy!
