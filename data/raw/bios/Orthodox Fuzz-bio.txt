Orthodox Fuzz is a Dallas-Fort Worth based heavy rock band taking influence from the great classic heavy rock and psychedelic bands of the 60s and 70s and stoner rock/doom bands from the 80s on up. Big fat riffs, slow grooves, fuzzed out guitars and bass, and crushing heaviness... Lo-fi, psychedelic, bluesy and a little retro. If you like Black Sabbath, Kyuss, Acid King, Fu Manchu, Sleep, Electric Wizard, traditional doom, stoner rock, heavy southern rock, and maybe some classic rock, you might dig the sound we have. 


We are gear freaks and play Gibson, Epiphone, Rickenbacker, Spector guitars and basses and loud big amps from Orange, Matamp, Marshall, Sunn and Mesa along with a bunch of other pedals and stuff. We play it loud, so if you come to a show be sure to bring some ear plugs. 


Keep checking back for more updates. Doom on...
