Pogrom 1147 hail from mighty Poland and produce some hatred-infused black metal with some obvious German thrash influences. 

Their lyrical themes include satanism, nihilism, darkness and war. 

Formed in 2001, on "Old Temple Records", their last known line-up is:

 Usurper - vocals (Katedra Patologii, session on Nuklear Antikrist), 
Carnifex - guitars & programming (Katedra Patologii, Nuklear Antikrist), 
Graven - guitars, Aeshtir - bass and Ubyr on drums.

Their full length, entitled "Black Metal Complete" features some bone crushing riffs, accompanied by some very well calculated, yet raw drumming patterns. Tracks like Unholy Mutilation, Instant Blasphemy rip through the ears of the listener, bringing back memories of Mayhem, Darkthrone, Kriegsmachine and even Besatt. 

This quartet manages to differentiate themselves from the rest of the Polish black metal scene, due to their unique sound. The rest of their discography includes two early demos (Rehearsal 2001; Exeuction 666, 2003) along with a very well-recieved EP, Blind Fury, released in 2003.
