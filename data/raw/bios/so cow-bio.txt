So Cow is an indie pop band led by Irish singer, songwriter, and guitarist Brian Kelly. While Kelly hails from Tuam (Ireland), So Cow got its start in Seoul (South Korea) during 2005, where Kelly had a job teaching English. The group evolved into a three piece band with Jonny White on bass and Peter O'Shea on drums.
