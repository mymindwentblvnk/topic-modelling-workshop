The SLAV group was formed in the middle of 1991 in Sofia, Bulgaria by Svetoslav Bitrakov, Lubomir Velev, Any Mitova (dancer) and Valentina Pouliova (painter).

As a formation in 'Art in Action' Association, it took part in the 'Light well' performance (1991) and the avant-garde happenings: 'Creation' (1991) and '1000a' (1992) but soon after continued as a music duo only.

Their wide musical background and performing skills led to invent an unique 'Transcendent eclectic' style of mixing elements from jazz, rock, symphonic, minimalist, new age, ambient to avant-garde with originality.

The SLAV group are:
Lubomir Velev: acoustic, electric & MIDI guitar, guitar synthesizer/modules,                keyboards, SFX, programming, voice
Svetoslav Bitrakov: acoustic & MIDI drums and percussion, MIDI wind
controller/modules, keyboards, flute, voice.

SLAV is also a hardcore band from Brooklyn, NY.
