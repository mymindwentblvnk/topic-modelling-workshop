Desolation Catalyst formed in October 2010 when guitarists Michael Holt and Benno Waible first met in a bar in Schwäbisch Gmünd. After a few jam sessions they threw their previously composed songs together, radically rewriting them and began composing new ones. In January 2011, Denis Kopp joined the band as the drummer, completely rewriting the drum tracks.

The band has performed several gigs from March 2011 with numerous bands (among Bleeding Red, Parasite Inc., Spirit of the Future Sun, Guiding Light Demise, Darkness Ablaze and others). Jakob Meyer (God of the Dead) and Martin Kienzle (On Delirious) were helping out as bass guitar players.

In October 2011 the band started recording their first EP “Hell’s Fire” at home with Martin Winkler mixing and mastering the tracks and recording the bass guitar. The EP was released in December 2011. In January 2012 Florian Brett (Last Torment) joined as the bass guitar player. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Desolation+Catalyst">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
