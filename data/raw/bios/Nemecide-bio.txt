NEMECIDE was founded in 2006 by a dedicated group of musicians, each exhibiting wildly divergent musical leanings and backgrounds. Through the years the band has evolved their sound, disregarded trends, and forged their own unique metal concoction that is NEMECIDE.

With their self-produced debut EP 'Incursion' recently released, a steady procession of extremely heavy live performances in the books, a full-length album and several epic shows on the horizon, NEMECIDE is ready to spread their heavy metal contagion to the masses.

NEMECIDE 2010 is a sonic convergence of unrelenting brutality, infectious melodies and bleak soundscapes â€“ executed with surgical precision and power. With the addition of keyboardist Charles Lee Ray to the band, NEMECIDE plans to take their sound to even darker, epic, symphonic depths in 2011 and beyond.

NEMECIDE is: Stephen J. Wrathburn (vocals), Vic Deakins (guitars), Von Teifert (guitars), H.P. Lovethrash (drums), Eric Velez (bass), Charles Lee Ray (keyboards). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nemecide">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
