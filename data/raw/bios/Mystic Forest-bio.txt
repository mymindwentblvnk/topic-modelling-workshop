Mystic Forest was a Melodic Black Metal group formed in 1997 in France. Drawing from the influences of early black metal bands and romantic/baroque classical composers such as Frederic Chopin, Claude Debussy and Nicolo Paganini, Mystic Forest is an unusual three-part operation, with Stefan Kozak playing all instruments and composing all music. Claire Guillot provides the vocals, and Baalberith writes all lyrics. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mystic+Forest">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
