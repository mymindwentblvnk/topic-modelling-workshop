From Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada to Moscow, Russia and Braga, Portugal Vermillion Lies charmed audiences the world over with their unique brand of beauty and creativity.

With songs ranging from lyrical folk ballads to raucous circus marches, the Vermillion sisters earned a reputation for an amazing live performance which enchanted audiences of all ages and had everyone clapping, singing, dancing, and playing along.

Real Life sisters, Zoe Boekbinder  and Kim Boekbinder  "Vermillion", have spent their lives honing their craft at clown boot camp and the local dump, where they found their favorite instruments like toy piano, accordion, typewriter, and BBQ grill. 

The live show involves the sisters pulling their odd instruments out of a large trunk onstage before each song,prompting the audience to ask, "What's in the box?" which incidentally is the name of their brand new album.

Vermillion Lies was based in Oakland, CA. The sisters no longer tour as Vermillion Lies but each have vibrant solo careers as Kim Boekbinder and Zoe Boekbinder <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vermillion+Lies">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
