BURY MY SINS started as a project in the end of 2003, located in the area of erfurt / bad hersfeld in the middle of germany , after some changes in the line-up we found together as a ‘full-time’ band in august 2004. …honest solid hard music from the heart, that’s what we wanted to play from on the first rehearsal!!! ...and so we did!!! our sound is influenced by different styles of metal & hardcore, cause we simply love it!!! all the songs are filled with the heights and depths and different sides of life, with the burning reality of our world today and with the struggle of keeping or giving up hope and goals!!! ...cause really nothing is easy!!!



...in the beginning of 2k5 we went to the RAPE OF HARMONIES STUDIO to record our first demo-songs and later on all tracks for our upcoming full-length ...our debut called "TODAY'S BLACK DEATH" ( incl. a video of the song “About Hope” ...check our web for this ) is out since feb 2k6 on CIRCULATION RECORDS ( well known for bands like NARZISS, HEAVEN SHALL BURN & FAUST AGAIN )!!!

...on a cold and rainy day in early 2k7 seven guys ( incl. our new bassplayer normen and adde @ N13-MEDIA on camera ) went to the X-TRAX STUDIOS in recklinghausen to pre-produce the song "Waving Flags in Times of Fire" and to shoot a brand new video-report about our small band!!!

...we went back to the RAPE OF HARMONIES STUDIO in spring-time 2k7 to record our second full-length called "KING OF ALL FEARS" incl. 9 brand new face breaking songs ...this piece of dark and sharp noise was released through GUIDELINE RECORDS in september 2k7!!!

…in 2009 we’ve started to work on our new upcoming record on SHARKMEN RECORDS ( home of international artists like WAR FROM A HARLOTS MOUTH, MOLOTOV SOLUTION, MILES AWAY & JULITH KRISHUN )!!!

...after only 3 studiodays we finished the recordings for RATS, our new EP out on SHARKMEN RECORDS and DAMAGE DONE RECORDS!!! this EP including 7 brand new tracks will be released on 10inch vinyl & cd in february 2k10!!! …BURY MY SINS marching towards demise!!!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bury+My+Sins">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
