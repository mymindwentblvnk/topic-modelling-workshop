Elyse and Larena, twins, and the youngest of almost a dozen children, escaped a Mormon upbringing in northwestern Montana. At 20, Elyse left religion and began writing music eventually ending up in Brooklyn NY. After leaving the repression of religion and experiencing similar barriers in the music industry, Elyse taught herself music production. “I wanted to have control over the sound. TOTAL control.”

Larena followed suit, left the church, and rejoined Elyse in NYC. Creating music together became a form of therapy. A way to share their story. They now write, produce, and perform this dark electro-pop out of NYC where MOTHERMARY live shows bring together a provocative performance of dance and “sacrilegious ritual”. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/mothermary">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
