There are two bands called A New Dawn -

1) A New Dawn is a d-beat / crust punk from Southern California. Their self titled EP is available for free download at http://anewdawnkang.bandcamp.com/

2) 'A New Dawn' is an eclectic metal band that has two leading ladies who are, just like the music, the musical opposites of each other.

You have the blond, sweet and caring girl versus the dark, strong and nightcrawling woman.


The metalsound of 'A New Dawn' isn't like the other sounds you hear. 'A New Dawn' has their own idea of making metal music. All the bandmembers come from different genres in music and this reflects in the unique sound of 'A New Dawn'. It's all different styles of music with a solid metal base.

The show of 'A New Dawn' is a must-see. Wherever you look, there's always something happening on stage. 'A New Dawn' is your guarentee for an outstanding show, great musicians and a brute metal sound.

The EP 'Finally...' was released in April 2010, now the wait for the new album can begin. With al the recordings done, the second full-length album can be expected in May 2011. Stay tuned and keep an eye on their website:
