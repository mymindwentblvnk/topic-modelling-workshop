Burning of I is, Jacob Weatherspoon (Guitars/Vocals), Jesse Brasch (Bass/Backing Vocals), Matt Fisne (Guitars), Tory McKeag (Drums)...piles...all of them.

All are locals of the Snoqualime Valley, east of Seattle. Started in 2004, Burning of I has worked diligently to prove to themselves and people across the Puget Sound, that they are for real. Both in the tenacity of writing/recording and the intensity of their live show. 

The first recording of an EP in 2006 'A Small Little Shack in a Big Wet Messy Nothing', was the first introduction of the styles that would be honed and sharpened with the 2009 release of 'Nowhere is a Destination'. This first full length album was a representation of how the sound had indeed evolved and how it would challenge listeners to step away from expectations.

Proud to play anywhere, for anyone, this group is looking to both surprise and excite listeners from across the globe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Burning+Of+I">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
