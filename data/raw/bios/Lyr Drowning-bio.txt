Lyr Drowning is a young atmospheric death metal band from Paris. It was formed in 2002 by Goulven (guitar, vocals), who started composing the first songs, quickly rejoined by the keyboard player Manu. Both were greatly influenced by bands like Opeth, Dimmu Borgir or Anathema, and the main project was to create majestic, dark metal songs with an important part of atmospheric, melodic elements.

In 2004, the two musicians began recording by themselves the first band's release, "Orchestral March", a five tracks MCD. At the same time, they tried to find musicians to make Lyr Drowning a "real" metal band. The thing was done with the arrival of Olivier (guitar), Seb (bass) and finally Erwan (drums). That complete line up allowed the band to do its first live performances, in 2006.

Lyr Drowning is now working on its first full lenght album, entitled "Blind from Birth". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lyr+Drowning">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
