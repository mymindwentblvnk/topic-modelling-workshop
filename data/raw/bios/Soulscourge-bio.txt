Soulscourge is a Doom Metal band from Brazil. 

Soulscourge was born in April of 2006. Although the little time of its existence, all members have experiences inside the metal scene of Florianópolis and they are relatively experienced musicians. 

The idea to mount a band of doom was initiative of Rafael “Void Mortem” (ex-Khrophus, ex-Osculum Obscenum), unconditional fan of doom metal, and Giuliano “Gwrath Chaos” (Still Life, Warkings, Selvagens da Monareta, Yellra). 

To compose the keyboards they had invited Erika “WinterLitany” (ex-Misdeed), one another fan of this musical genre. 

Afterwards enter Rade “Grafvitnir” (ex-Misdeed) and Leonardo “Chagash” (Austhral). 

Dramatical and melancholic compositions, without however subordinating themselves to any subgenre of doom, integrate the soundscape of Soulscourge. 

Each music contains its proper thematic and atmospheres, and although the letters to retrace the subjects as the anguish and the existence, they compose the beginning of a tragic cycle of lieder - Prelude to Tragedy (Demo, 2006). 

Line Up: 
* Void Mortem (Vocals and Guitars) 
* Grafvitnir (Guitars) 
* WinterLitany (Strings and Piano) 
* Chagash (Bass) 
* Gwrath Chaos (Drums)
