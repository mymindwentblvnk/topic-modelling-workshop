The music of Eternal Embrace seeks to express the depth of emotion through the human condition. The rise and fall of tempo and melody creates epic movements born of wonderous inspiration and artistic will. Where darkness swallows and rhythms roll, in the swerve of the undercurrent music unfolds. With breath and fire, a dance of sound, music unearthed from underground. The pulsing of color, the beat of a drum, voices that mingle have begun. Slow beats spill into song, as a drone from the keyboard strings you along. Matching the groove, guitar starts to wail, bass picks up low tones in the exhale. An angelic symphony of violin chords, ancient and beautiful, a choir of mistfits.

Eternal Embrace from Manchester, NH creates an unique tapestry combining many different styles of music, using world instrument sounds, violin and cello, haunting keyboard melodies, driving guitars, tribal drumming and gothic-metal style vocals. With influences ranging from death metal, black metal, doom metal, gothic rock, new wave, classical, gypsy and middle eastern music, enter the world of Eternal Embrace to experience music as theater, esoteric dreams and exotic experimentation. Eternal Embrace has performed with such international acts as Katatonia, Swallow the Sun, Leave's Eyes and Insomnium.
