Carmen and Lili met one fateful evening in 1999 in an alley at an Imperial Teen show. They enlisted Mat (a former beau of BOTH ladies) to be their drummer. In the spring of 2001 they flew down to Athens, Georgia and recorded with Bill Doss from Olivia Tremor Control. Fun Fact: Mat's half-brother, Ryan, co-runs the Kindercore record label. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pocket+Rockets">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
