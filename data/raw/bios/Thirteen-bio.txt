Early albums fit into the 'SlowCore' genre, drawing comparisons to seminal artists such as Low, Spokane, and Elliott Smith. More recently, the tempo and urgency of Thirteen's music has increased, perhaps closer to the contemplative rock music of Radiohead, Torres or Nine Inch Nails in their more reserved moments. He has released more electronic music under the name Aarvo
