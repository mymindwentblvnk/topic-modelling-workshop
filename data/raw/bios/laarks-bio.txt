Laarks is a indie pop four piece from Eau Claire, WI. The band includes Ian Jacoby (keys, vocals), Kyle Flater (guitar), Zach Hanson (bass), and Brian Moen (drums). The band's sound is defined by Jacoby's soaring pop vocals, Flater's atmospheric angular guitar work, and Hanson's churning bass neatly tied to Moen's explosive and dynamic drumming. Laarks released their debut full length "An Exaltation of Laarks" in March of 2009 on Absolutely Kosher Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Laarks">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
