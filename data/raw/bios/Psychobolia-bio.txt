French brutal death metal group from Paris, Île-de-France, founded in may 2003.

In 2006 the debut album "Fisting You All" was recorded during the months of May and June, mixed in August (mastered the following year). The recording was engineered by François Ugarte who would also end up playing bass on the album after Aurélien's last minute hand injury before entering the studio. François remained in the band for the shows that followed. In December 2007, Psychobolia signs a worldwide distribution deal with Xtreem Music. The band plays some shows (playing alongside bands such as Suffocation, Psoriasis, Impureza, etc...) and keeps writing music for further releases.
Their debut album album is released in February 2008
