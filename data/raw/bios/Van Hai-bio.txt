Based in Switzerland, Van Hai is originally from Vietnam and is an artist in the true sense of the word. Not only does he take us on a voyage into the heart of emotion through music, but also through other diverse art forms such as video, plastic and graphic art, writing and photography.

Leaving the strict dance floor format, his compositions are aimed at the attentive listener and enlarge the electronic spectrum by suggesting an alternative to clubbing.

2009 is a crucial year for Van Hai as he prepares to release several very important projects:
His first album called Intimacy will be released before the end of the year and several projects and EP's on labels such as Natura Sonoris and Factor City in Spain, Petit Monstre in Mexico, Perspectiv in Switzerland or Kina Music in Italy.

His previous projects released on Perspectiv, Meerestief and Time Has Changed have already been acclaimed by major players in the scene and each of his upcoming releases are eagerly awaited. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Van+Hai">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
