[2003-2008]
Formed in Southport, Merseyside in late 2003, Dilacerate played chuggy mid paced death metal.

Split up in early 2008. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dilacerate">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
