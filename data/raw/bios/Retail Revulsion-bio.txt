Retail Revulsion is a blackened death metal band from Roanoke, Virginia that formed in 2015.  It is a side-project featuring two members from Human Infection.  Their gimmick is that their lyrics are about their hatred of working retail.  The band consists of The Freightslinger (Andrew Brown) on vocals and The Unloader (Andrew Matthews) on guitar & bass.  They released a demo in 2016 entitled Pallets of the Profane.  Their lyrical themes include the horrors of working retail and Satanism. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Retail+Revulsion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
