After signing to Too Pure, the group re-released Three Fingers and toured the UK and US again. Tours in Europe and Australia followed before releasing their most recent effort, The Invisible Deck, in 2006.

The group disbanded in 2007.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rogers+Sisters">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
