Born in 2005 in Michigan, Ye Olde Relic is best described as a self-conscious metal band. While sharing the sound of folk, black, and melodic death metal, it is a band that cannot be placed in one specific genre. 

The band plans to release a new album in the Summer of 2009, only under a different name, as the project has succeeded its original intention of being a humorous black metal band.

Lyrics to Seasons:

March

There is nothing to say about March

April

[In German: Something about being welcomed to hell, and then something about semen and ramen noodles]

I've been on my own now
For almost one whole year
This Earth has been mine for me to walk
To find some sort of reason
To call my own
This is my home

But I have found a new hope in the sky
The sun!
As it guides the change of a season
Into a new brink of Spring
We are all glad we could finally see the light

In truth, there couldn't be less care in my soul
Now I'm finding my way past the blooming orchards of springs
This new feeling is almost fatally blissful in my mind
But I've missed for so long

The dawn of this new age
The first smell of spring
The smell I feel
I can feel you
(In this life, a sunset will comfort my mind)

But as I'm sleeping
An intruder from the North
Came down and spilled the cause of an interrupted peace

And I knew since October
The harm that this would bring
But the air seemed so cool
That my mind was fatally optimistic
After all, it's spring
And the gentle caress of the tree makes everything fine to me

I know I've seen this
I know I've felt this before
It seemed so right
But as I dwell, deeper in the shade
I'm gone before I'm lost to nature's cruel charade

Another long season is over
And now I'm fine

May

A celebration for a new age of life
For now just once this dream is not only in my mind

The pounding in my heart
The sensation in my chest

The winds directing the seeds of a new dawn of a young man's heart who thought he'd never know
She came forth from the dock the wind now standing still
[More German: Something about semen and ramen noodles]

It's been almost one whole year since the air smelled so crisp
And I can swear to you the sun never shined so bright

The bastard fermenting in the mind behind that face
The cold and sorrow storm that brews inside her chest

The damned darkness that would lay behind the mask
A masquerade to dance around my mind's collapse

(Jokingly: And I will see again.. the clown!)

AWESOME SOLO ENSUES

June

We marched down the windy plains
On an adventure unknown
Our goal is to conquer the sun 
And break it into our hearts

The wrath of June
Burning and blinding eternal
Last I heard I fainted
When the rays burned my eyes

And the rays burn forever
An inch became a mile
In the burning deserts of death
I knew what was to come
As the final battle ensued

Raise the swords!
Raise them high!
It is the time to DIE!

One slash! One blow!
A strike away from glory!
One dream! One blow!
A hero in this story!
Of fate and death 
The horns ring proud
As my men scream!

(In German: I think he's talking about how shitty FC Koln did, and then losing your shaving razor in the toilet and getting shit on your arm when you go to pick it up)

(Inaudible)
Of various decent
Sat around the table
And wept for their dead

I love how the wind carries my feet
As I run down the field that I hate
Running for my glory
Running for my life
God unknown
God of judgment

[In German: I like ramen noodles and semen!]

July

Instrumental

August

You listen here you motherfucker!
Fuck, piss, shit, and taint!
I've been loathing you all summer long
And now it's time for me to give you back what your worth
Which, to me, is nothing but SHIT!

I can't hold on!

It's back to school now, jerk off
Time to wake up and smell the Hi-C
It's time to let go and let the love die!

And I'd let it die, just like that

I just want to sleep
I just want to feel

In this play of life
The summary, is written on a pamphlet
The pamphlet of DOOM
The changing of the scene

Torro!

A reforming memory
Atonement of your will
The answer inside
Inside your cactus

The sky is so low
So low is the sky
In your mind
Your mind is so low

[Scat improvisation]

I can't wait
Indecision
Mind is numb
Goin fishin
Abstract conclusion
It's so clear
Swear your friends
Abstract fishin

And I held on to this belief that
For the entire summer long
What I knew was true
But in fact, the following year still wouldn't bring satisfaction
This is the first chapter of the conclusion
Expose finale

And I still cling to you, your fact
Your shine, your love, you in the sky
The sun!
Bring the cracked mirror of lie
Your eyes, your shine, your touch, your face
Your spite, your hate
And your


SHIT!


I'm not swayed by your pitiful lies
You turd sac monger
You're mohel of poop!
A mohel of poop!
A shack of shit

September

Then September came from nowhere
And the heat of summer came cold
I could not lie it was the end
It was the end of the story we told

The frost would soon come take us
The leaves will wilt away
Everything we made will die
But speak of doom you'd never say

I saw the world change as the first leaf turned brown
Across the meadow of which it would drown

Take this, now
Before it breaks
This memory
Soon despair
Must go away

The sun wept as it set
On the first day of this month
It knew better than all of us
That time was at its end

I thought as I sat by the tree
That there must be a way to reverse
The coldness of this perdition
The drain the soul of its hearse 

As it was slowly dying
In confines of my mind
I held it in my heart
The truth I thought I knew

Your frozen idol of death!

September turned away
And remained the jester of fate
Much too far to be held
And too sure to be saved

She stood there! But I could never sleep!

A million ages, of another bloodstained ground
And one who ceases to exist who will never become found

September! Take me!

October

On the eve of this guilt-ridden Autumn
The sun made its sound that it would die
And the leaves would fall in protest
[No idea what I said here]

The clouds in the sky will triumph
Turning the blue into grey
The final chance of redemption fell
My eyes wept for the truth I knew

Here me out, O Autumn night
This ill-fated bidding shall end
Your guilt-ridden spite will fester into a thousand winters to come
Your indescribable wrath will take its toll on my heart
This gleaming symbol of hope is a bastard sensation of death

Cruel as any nature I knew

Where you Autumn day or were you Autumn night?
In my soul I felt you breathing the cruel reminder of fate
Take me in your arms and feed me your just spite
[No idea what I said here]
And now it is gone
The truth that  I thought that I knew
Your damned wand of doom
Rising in the sea
Closing in on mortal life
[No idea...]

Fight for life!
Fight for death!
Fight for endless summer!
I just wanted to know this winter won't be my last

[ABOSOLUTELY NO IDEA what I said here haha]

The day of Autumn is a prelude to winter's death
I held you as an angel to my lonely death
An angel of death
Autumn! 
October!

Take me, let me die alone
All on my own [Favorite moment of the album]

November

Approaching winter
I fear your cold
I damn your skies of grey
Who burn my heart of mold

I run through the forest
And fell over myself
Lying in fallen leaves
I cry and yell aloud

Oh demon of frost
I dare you go away!
Leave it to my mind
To complete your biting dismay

One last breath
For my one last step
This pain I feel burns through my soul

A time of reckoning for my tolls and sin
A sweeping form of death
For this world to finally end

Let's hear to the ring for the place that I call home

When I saw you wrestle through the fate and the stone-AH!
I bridged this gap of knowledge and ran alone-AH!

And I call you home
But inside I know

Soiled in memory
The fate has run black
The world I saw is a memory
Never to come back

I damn you winter
Black inside your soul
And I spite your frost bitten winds
Who rob of blissful gold

December

The mystery of the soul is a mountain of frost

[In German: Hey kids have you washed your dick today? And goes on to talk about something about soup]

Oh this season is a cold one
The burning of ice on the chest
The grimmest in score years
The burning in my side

The winter approaches
A vantage frost in my cold heart
This death will be a mountain
Of your frost bitten death

And I damned you winter
To rot in the grey pits of hell
I saw you drown
In the murky cold depths of ice

Your winter is cold
And I've gone on too long
The view has grown old
And I succumb to the ground
In this eveless winter
In the eve of December
The world wept a tear
For my people to remember
Why I die this death
Why I fell so far
Why I rot in the snow
And why I sail alone

But I will change this!

Abuse me in this snow abyss
A wolf of pride
To dim my weeping cry

The season is over
The change is forever

Five million naked trolls of death
In terror and in my soul
To change my cold stained breath
In terror and in my soul-AH!

In your soul
In this death

January

The last dream I knew was a cold summer night
The nature had penetrated the silt and the streams had filled with murky water and clay

The shift would last forever 
Thrusting the Earth into dusk
The swamps would freeze and the snow would fall
The shadow king would reign

A domination of guilt and hate
Tore from the wounds of the wolf
The tears of nature's grief
Flooded the land and burdened our lives

Too many times this winter has burned our souls
With frost and buried the orchards with white
And blackened the summer's hope

And this sheet of grey is a reminder of the cold spite in her heart
The freezing glare in her eyes and the frost bitten tear in her soul
Nature's cruel grasp on my mind

The seeds of doubt were mended with the first flake hitting the land
Swan of doubt, impending doom
I look for the hope in the sky

Calling all true traitors
This winter is your fate
Sealed with a blanket of ice
And marred in a layer of frost

This winter is my last I know!
I feel it in my heart!

One last step to you
I moved through it my mind
The redeeming fact of love in summer
Unchain my hand, bring forth
In my hand, in my mind, I can see you

You would betray me
And you would betray me

Once I saw it and once I felt the sun, I know, soon I'll find it again!

February

The season has changed

Once before in this life
I strode back through these fields so grey
And in my mind back then
The blur cursed my mind in vein
Her ghastly goddess of death
Loomed these ill-forsaken lands
Swallow of doom, she would praise
But never enough to confess

This path would lead me down my road
Back down the road again, to a new age of the same
Walking without aim. Fast, unbothered by the dark
Gloom of the street, winding on away

Away from now
This damned from the dark
No waves of ecstasy
A blind caress of a kiss blow to me

A show undone
Unraveled by its guilt 
Unwind the tapestry
I know it then you will see

The second hand draws close


If you could stand patiently for the end of this grand scheme
You would see that I meant well and all I meant was you to see
The sun in the sky
But now I’m too far gone, but I’ll wait for the next to see it

But before I can leave
I must leave the world with a fact
Knowing that I could stand strong
Amongst the thawing grounds of death
In this world, there is one
Only one world to know
And now I see there was everything alive
Is now just dead

Beckoning hell
By your grasp
You left and the sun fled 
And the world turned to grey
An angel of despair
A podium of doom
The lesson learned by
The spring-age doom

In this world I sit, and I wait for love, wait for love. Wait for the leaves to grow and the grey to fade. 

If you could stand patiently for the end of this grand scheme
You would see that I meant well and all I meant was you to see
The sun in the sky
But now it’s too far gone, but I’ll wait for the next to see it

And now I know, the answers in the sky
