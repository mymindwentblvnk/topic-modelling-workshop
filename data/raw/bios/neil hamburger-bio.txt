Neil Hamburger is a standup comedian character played by comedian and musician Gregg Turkington.

Hamburger's live act, which is quite different from his many albums, features a barrage of question/answer jokes aimed often at celebrity targets, including Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Michael Jackson, Smash Mouth, Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Jim Morrison, and Steven Tyler, as well as depressing barbs aimed at his ex-wife. His pacing is off, and he clears his throat nonstop through his entire routine, often to keep overzealous fans from shouting out his punchlines. He has performed in front of audiences worldwide from Madison Square Garden to Jimmy Kimmel Live and the confrontational aspects of his act have drawn cursory comparisons to Tony Clifton.One of his most famous gags is the "Zipper Lips", in which he asks an audience member a question. If the audience member doesn't respond, Hamburger derides them for being a "zipper lips". A common phrase used by the comedian is "But that's my life!" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Hamburger">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
