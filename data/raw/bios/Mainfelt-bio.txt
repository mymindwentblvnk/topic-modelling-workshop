Mainfelt, a band from the heart of South Tyrol in Italy, was formed by Patrick Strobl, Kevin Prantl and Veit Rinner in the summer of 2011. The three were making music long before Mainfelt but, it was after beating out fierce competition to take home the "International Live Award" in 2010 that they found their true genre and Mainfelt was formed. The folk/country band adopted Stephanie Blaas to record their first few songs and she soon became a permanent member.
The band was now complete lead by Patrick Strobl on guitar, Kevin on banjo, Veit on bass, and Stephanie rounding up percussion and backing vocals. Mainfelt set sail to perform on both local and international stages, routinely entertaining crowds in Salzburg, Linz, Innsbruck, Gstaad.
With their honest lyrics, accompanying rhythms and exciting tunes, it was not long before the band took their music overseas. A week in New York City performing in Manhattan's local band scene and open mic aroused the band's ambitions. That summer they arranged a two week tour, with shows in Dublin, Berlin, Bielefield, and Vienna. The tour was the beginning of a concert rich summer. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mainfelt">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
