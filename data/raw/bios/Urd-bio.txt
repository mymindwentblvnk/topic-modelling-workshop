URD (유알디) is a Korean hip hop duo.

Urd was a Norwegian didgeridoo project from the 90`s. The band members were: Halvdan Kittil Engen, Ole Bjørn Michel and Svein P. Wesenlund.

URD was the name of a short lived Danish funk band who released a single album (Funky One) in 1995. Their style was heavily influenced by Parliament and Funkadelic, and like those bands always performed in outlandish costumes. 

Also one of the three Norns of the Norse Mythology, Urd came alive in a celeb anime of mangaka Kosuke Fujishima; Aaa Megamisama! (Oh! My Goddess!)

There are some CDs of the anime series, where talented Singer Yumi Touma lend her voice to the naughtier of the three Norns. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Urd">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
