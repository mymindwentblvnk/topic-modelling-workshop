Caladmor was born from the band Pale which was founded in 2001. Throughout all years of playing together the sound of the band has gone through a long development. The result is a certain particular sound, reminding of gothic and folk metal, but it always shows a touch of peculiarity. The common ground of all of their songs is the charismatic voice of front singer Barbara, which builds a stirring contrast to the vocals and growls of drummer Maede. 

Although it’s difficult to put the style of Caladmor in a certain edge, this doesn’t mean that their music isn’t aiming straight for the listener’s ears, mind and heart. Already as Pale, the band could celebrate several successes, such as playing a gig abroad (Prague) and having a prerecording on the CD-Sampler of Germany’s well-known Gothic magazine ‘Orkus’. After Plaeschy had joined the band in autumn 2009 as a second guitar player, the line-up was finally completed and the band was ready to hit the stages.
