Formed in 2007, Haken is a virtuoso progressive rock / progressive metal band from London, England, comprising some of the country's finest young musicians. Featured in the band are members of To-Mera and Linear Sphere and Anchorhead.

In July 2007, Haken showcased their music for the very first time to a packed out London bar with a great response, followed the next week by a sold out show at The Peel in Kingston. Within months of this double-debut performance, Haken were billed in support of Riverside (Inside Out) at Camden's prestigious Underworld. Haken continued performing sets to packed houses throughout London and on UK tours in support of cult metal bands King's X (Inside Out), Bigelf (Custard Records), and To-Mera.

One of Haken's demo tracks was featured on the cover CD for the second issue of 'Classic Rock Presents Prog' magazine in 2009. 

Haken meld metal with progressive rock, drawing influences from contemporary bands like Dream Theater and IQ as well as "old school" icons Genesis and Queen. 

_Aquarius_ is Haken's debut release - a 72 minute, larger than life conceptual sci-fi/fantasy work filled with bombastic keyboard flourishes, stunning vocals, and lethal guitarwork. The album was recorded in Germany at Spacelab Studios (Delain, Everon, Wolverine) and mastered in Germany at Eroc's Mastering Ranch. The stunning artwork is by Dennis Sibeijn at Damn Engine created to tie in with the Aquarius story.

Early on in the writing process for the album, Haken were contacted by the Laser's Edge Group who later signed the band to their specialist progressive metal label Sensory Records, through which _Aquarius-
_ was released worldwide in March 2010
