Templo de Fogo was formed in 1998 (Brazil), when ex member of the band Sagrada Cruz decided to start a new project. The band had an evolution as similar to bands like Helloween, first having influences of heavy metal and hard rock then changing to a melodic power metal, always singing in portuguese (except for the album Judgment). Moisés Missão is the main member of the band, staying since 1998 as vocalist and guitarrist of Templo de Fogo.
