Named after a Misfits song, Where Eagles Dare, from Tempe, Arizona, with screeching vocals reminiscent of  early Stretch Arm Strong and Shutdown. Musically coming at you like a mixture of both the afformentioned bands with melody, speed, and well written lyrics.

Where Eagles Dare is no longer together, but is still considered by much of Arizona's hardcore scene as one of the best bands to ever come out of their hometown. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Where+Eagles+Dare">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
