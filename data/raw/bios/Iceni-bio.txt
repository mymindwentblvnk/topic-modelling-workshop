Founded by Hroðgar in 2003 under the original name Axiom, Iceni is a UK band whose sound is described by the founding member as Albion Metal. They take their inspiration from very early British history. The music is enriched with epic folk and pagan touches in addition to an early Black Metal sound.

History:
Before the summer of 2006 the band was called Axiom (UK) which was Hroðgar's one man effort before the name of the project changed and the lineup was fleshed out to allow the music to be taken to a live setting.  

Iceni's name was inspired from the Brythonic tribe of the same name who were the inhabitants of the modern day area of Norfolk between the 1st century BC and the 1st Century AD.

The only recording to be released under the original name was the limited to #100 copies Defiant Heathen Spirit (demo) on January 17th, 2005.  This was a CDr with pro printed booklet and inlay via Hroðgar's  own Monolith-Studio label. Later that year the German label Stunde Des Ideals released #500 copies of the same demo in cassette format.

On September 3rd, 2007 the 2nd release As Carnyx Screams Consume the Silence (demo).  The music on this release took was more mature and accomplished compared to the first and had a more epic folk/pagan metal sound.

Iceni's current live lineup consists of Hroðgar taking on vocal duties, Adam and Ulfgar are on guitars, lead and rhythm respectively whilst bass guitar is handled By Sam and James fills in behind drum kit.
