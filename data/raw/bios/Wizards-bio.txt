3. The project of a musician/student in Ann Arbor, MI. You can download the first EP at Wizards' official website.

4.  An American Hip-Hop/Comedy quartet that slays dragons and maidens all while potion mixin' every day and smoking on the finest wizard weed. The Wizards were cast out of their Shire, The Shire of Orolake, after fucking the King's 4 headed hydra. They landed in LA present day, and use their tongue twisting abilities to cast spells to spit through the wire mesh of a microphone. History in the making. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wizards">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
