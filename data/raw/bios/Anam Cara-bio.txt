Straight out of Tampa Bay, Anam Cara is an energetic mixture of metal, melodies, and heavy breakdowns. This Florida band is exactly that, a hardcore band whos sound is established in the influence of Florida's music scene that has produced bands like Strongarm, Poison the Well, Further Seems Forever, and Underoath. But while Anam Cara is a self proclaimed "Florida Hardcore Band" they are stylisticly different from their peers. Unfourtunately, the band broke up in July of 2006, with no hard feelings among the members. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Anam+Cara">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
