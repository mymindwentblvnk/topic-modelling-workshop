2) It all started when Birgitte Moe (24 years old in 2000) was going to audition for an other Norweigan danceband Devotion. Then she heard that Kjell Gabriel Henriksen needed a singer for his band, after a lot of hard work she finally convinced him to let her try singing. The band was at the time named Barbie-Q and consisted of three rappers and a vocalist. When Birgitte joined the group they changed their name into Infinity. 

Their first album Www.Happy-Poeple.net was somewhat quite succesful. It went straight to #1 just after release selling more than 30.000 copies in Norway. The following album was planned to be Www.Sporty-People.net, the corresponding website had even been created ! But for some reasons, it had never been released (apart from one single called Boys And Girls or 1-2-3-4). Instead there was an album entitled Naked In The Rain, still featuring the voice of Brigitte, the same happy euro style as the previous one. The two singles from this album were covers of the old D.A.D. hit Sleeping My Day Away (also covered by Me & My) and Naked In The Rain.
