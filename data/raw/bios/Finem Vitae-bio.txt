In 2012, Feigr Jenkins and Ásólfr, members of black metal bands Hithaeglir and Aurea Mediocritas, started to have a craving to play other metal genres. Originally a black-thrash project, Finem Vitae was born under the name Beer Barrel (or something like that). Shortly after, drummer and long-time friend Do Riti joined the band.
It was back then that they started to get into doom metal, particularly due to Ásólfr's doom influences, and this band was properly born.
In June 2013, original drummer and founding member Do Riti temporarily left the band because of personal problems. He might return some time in the future, but Feigr Jenkins will be the band's drummer until then.
