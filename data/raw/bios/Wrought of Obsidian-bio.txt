Blending the fierce intensity of grinding death metal with the majesty and lyrical approach of power metal, Texas-based WROUGHT OF OBSIDIAN aim to break new musical ground with its inventive and commanding "warrior metal." Against a backdrop of swirling guitars, blasting drums and ever-changing timings, visions of bloody swords or battling demonic creatures easily come to mind. The seasoned four-piece, featuring DEVOURMENT drummer Eric Park, is set to release their debut album "At Long Last" this summer. Known for experimentation and uncompromising musicianship, the group formerly performed under the HYPERION banner, releasing a critically acclaimed EP in 2006, "To Capture The Sun." Tours and dates with IN FLAMES, CRADLE OF FILTH, CEPHALIC CARNAGE and TRIVIUM followed. Dedicated to those who stand resolute and persevere, “At Long Last,” is engineered by Braxton Henry (DROWNING POOL, A DOZEN FURIES) and promises to blaze a fresh musical trail of fantasy-driven, viciously aggressive metal.
