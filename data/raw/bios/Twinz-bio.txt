Twinz is a musical duo out of the Long Beach, California, the Twinz consist of Deon "Trip Loc" and Dewayne "Wayniac" Williams. After working with Warren G on his debut "G-Funk Era", the Twinz released their debut album Conversation in 1995, during which they found modest hits with "Round & Round" and "Eastside LB". This album is now considered an overlooked classic. On Tha Eastsidaz debut album, "Snoop Dogg Presents Tha Eastsidaz", The Twinz were featured on the track "Dogghouse" under the name Tha Locs. There were rumours around that The Twinz signed a deal under the name Tha Locs with Snoop's label, but in the end they were never mentioned on the official roster list of Snoop's Doggystyle Records. The Twinz can also be found on Lime Block's release "Heated" on the track "Tha Blues" (K.D.W. Records 2000), on 5 Footaz release "The Lost Scrolls" and on several tracks of Goldie LocÂ´s underground release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Twinz">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
