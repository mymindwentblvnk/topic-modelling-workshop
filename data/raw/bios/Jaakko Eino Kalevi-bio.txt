Jaakko Eino Kalevi is an electronic musician from Tiituspohja, Finland.

Born and raised in the central Finnish lakeland city of Jyväskylä, Jaakko’s musical journey began in the mid-’90s when, aged 11 or 12, he discovered the progressive metal of US rockers Dream Theater, whose riffs he and a pal would play on guitar. Hip-hop came next and Jaakko learned to make beats using Fruity Loops and a sampler. There followed passionate investigations into reggae, disco, techno and whatever else his friends or the internet happened to introduce to him. 

After several EPs and a 2011 album called Modern Life, Jaakko signed to Weird World / Domino to release the Dreamzone EP.
