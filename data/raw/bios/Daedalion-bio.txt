N.E founded the band in 1996 -  Daedalion was originally formed as a Brutal Death metal band - though it wasn't until about 7 years later that he released with T.R.T the first Daedalion Black Metal demo "Ad Sacrificium Offerre Corpus Meum".

Two years after "Daedalion Fili Luciferiis" will be unleashed.

Daedalion's first album was released in 2007.
"Sainte Folie/ Erige Un Empire" contains the Medieval and Thrash influences with the violence increased by a better production.

The lyrical content and theme is centered mainly on misanthropy, nihilism and legends.
