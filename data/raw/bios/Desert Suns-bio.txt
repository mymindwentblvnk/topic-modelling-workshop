Facebook, Bandcamp

San Diego California's Desert Suns are a new band in 2014 with an old school sound! With "Some of the doomiest riffs that would make one Mr. Iommi a very happy and proud person" says Bill Goodman in his review of the Desert Suns single Burning Temples. With influences of stoner rock, doom metal, sludge, psychedelic and blues you can expect a wide range of sound on the follow up E.P. which is at the top of the list for the band at the moment.

With Dave Russell on bass & vocals, Woogie Maggard & Anthony Belluto on guitar, and Ben Mcdowell on drums this band has a big sound! "some fantastic guitaring and solos. The drums are on par with something you'd hear from Bill Ward or John Bonham. Vocally, it's similar to Ozzy but a bit less pitch"

With all members having been on the San Diego music scene for years, there is no shortage of previous bands, albums and accomplishments. To add to these accomplishments Desert Suns have big plans for 2014. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Desert+Suns">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
