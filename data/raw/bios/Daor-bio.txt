Originating in Gibraltar, Daor received critical acclaim after a number of successful live shows in their hometown and in Spain. Since their arrival in the UK, Daor have firmly established themselves in Nottingham's burgeoning Metal Scene. The arrival of vocalist Tom Walker completes the current line up, with the band looking to pick up where they left off...

Wielding a sickening combination of brutal riffs and haunting melodies, Daor provide an onstage experience of blistering intensity and technical precision that grapples with an untameable explosion of live energy.

Revel in this most perfect expression of scorn... This is humanity's lesson in humility.

Some of the bands DAOR had the opportunity to rip it up with:
Napalm Death, Raging Speedhorn, Architects, Gutworm, Tangaroa, Devil Sold His Soul, Sanzen, 80's Matchbox B Line Disaster, Shaped By Fate, Clone The Fragile, Anewhope, Postmortem Promises.
