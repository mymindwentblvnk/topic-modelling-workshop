The Swedish folk music group Babajaga with its five members was formed in the
end of the year 2000. By then the musicians had been playing together for a number
of years in different constellations.
Because of their different backgrounds, both as classically educated instrumentalists
as well as self-taught folk musicians, they have lots of musical sources to gain their
inspiration from.
All these influences are mixed into a whole where anything might happen.
Babajaga want to tell stories, give a picture, a landscape where there is space to create
your own story. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Babajaga">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
