An acoustic/indie artist from Leicester, Leo Stannard started playing guitar at the just nine years old. He has drawn inspiration from artists such as Damien Rice, Bon Iver, and Ben Howard, and eventually took it upon himself to create his own original sound. Stannard was discovered by his manger, Mark Murdoch, when he performed an acoustic session with RTTV, singing a song he composed himself called "Please Don't". Since then, he has played alongside Maverick Sabre, Tom Odell, Rae Morris and Lewis Mokler, and the like. Leo Stannard released his first EP, Notions, in October 2014.
