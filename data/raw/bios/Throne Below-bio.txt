Throne Below is one-man black metal act hailing from South Africa. The project started out in 2008 as ambient/raw black metal. The first EP, "Winter Eternal" was released in 2009 and received positive feedback from followers. In 2011 the EP, "All Heathens Rise" was released and the sound was quite different from the previous work. The new sound had a better production and drew more inspiration from Norwegian acts such as Urgehal and Tsjuder.

In 2013 the debut album, "Defy Deceit Destroy" was released and by this time the sound of Throne Below had matured since 2011. This album drew a lot of inspiration from Greek,French and Swedish orthodox black metal bands.The music cannot be considered as orthodox black metal, however there are orthodox elements within the sound.

Orlok is the sole member and handles guitars,bass,vocals and drum programming. This band strongly opposes religion - especially Christianity, and furthermore it stands for self-enlightenment. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Throne+Below">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
