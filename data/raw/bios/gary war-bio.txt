Gary War (real name, Greg Dalton) is an American avant-garde musician, born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. His recordings combine tape and digital collage techniques, with heavily synthesized electronic psychedelia, acid punk, musique concr√®te and certain elements of classical music, progressive rock and dance music into a mutant strain of modern experimental rock. War is currently based in New Zealand and Gloucester, Massachusetts.

His returning to wash down the blitzkrieg of 2012's Jared's Lot with four new tracks that implode outwardly, suspended from a thread that binds psychic devastation to cosmic inspiration. Furthering his endeavors to drag song structure into the future, the cuts here swirl with refracted melodies layered meticulously upon streams of arpeggiated machine rock and disembodied voices that coalesce into unlikely hooks, all permeated with the feverish emotional content that has graced all of War's work thus far. A deeper step into a pool of progressive maximal wave and distinctly modern psychedelia.
