DEFAMER’s inception began late 2006 with sole intention of creating uncompromising death metal. After locally circulating a self titled demo in 2007 and following up with the "In Winter It Began" demo in 2008, DEFAMER shot to national infamy playing interstate festivals, supporting the likes of VADER, CARCASS, and CANNIBAL CORPSE. January 2009 saw DEFAMER unleash the debut full length CHASM with reviews hailing it as a chaotic and relentless onslaught. Recorded live in a desolate area in Brisbane's far north, the band wanted to capture the intense energy that met the pinnacles of their live reputation. Upon release the band toured Australia incessantly and made the leap over the Tasman Sea to New Zealand with grinders HUMAN in support of The Great Rift / Anti 7" split. After the departure of guitarist Mitchell Rogers, the remaining members of DEFAMER became focused on finalising material for a new record. Live shows boded well as a four piece and the writing took on a more condensed death metal sound to emerge with their sophomore album, DECREPIT RITUALS and an eleven date Japanese and Australian tour over February and March 2012.
