Tyranny of Hours is a Power- Progressive band based out of the Northwest United States. Going against the grain of the local music scene (primarily indy-rock, post grunge, blues and tribute bands), they united their influences of fusion and progressive rock with European metal to create their own brand of music. Featuring the soaring vocals of singer Michelle Mattair, Tyranny of Hours’ single “Amber” – released prior to the debut album- is generating rave reviews from regional and international press and fans, alike.

 
Tyranny of Hours formed late 2010 when guitarist Don Graham and singer Michelle Mattair united with keyboard player/composer James Borst from Cry for Eden. Drummer Larry London added his skills in October 2011 and Jordan Harrington joined on Bass in October 2012. The Band is currently gearing up for live shows in support of their album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tyranny+of+Hours">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
