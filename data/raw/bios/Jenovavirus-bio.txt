Jenovavirus was a guttural slamming brutal death metal band from Oonojyo / Fukuoka, Japan. The band was formed in 2005 by Sowtiis (Vocals), Atutician (Guitar) and Hexelvidom (bass), and create odd atomspheric, creepy slam. The music has its moments with techenical death metal arpeggiated riffs, plenty of slams and Disconformity-ish blasting parts.

They self-released their debut demo in 2006 which has six amazing clean production slamming gutteral tunes on, which has hit the scene in a wave of low gutteral gurgling, punchy slams and atmorspheric interludes giving it an odd but tasteful feel.

The band is currently polishing their debut album which will hold 13 slamming brutal gutteral mayhem tracks on it in late 2008.

The band was forced to split up because of financial problems.
