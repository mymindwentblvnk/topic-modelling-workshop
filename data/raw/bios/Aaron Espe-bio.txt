Aaron Espe ( born Aaron Sheldon Espe on August 27, 1981) is an American singer-songwriter, instrumentalist and record producer.

Alighting upon the folk music scene two years ago from the upland wilds of Northern Minnesota, Espe garnered the attention that one might expect from a significant talent: 
-“My Whole Life” a top 20 album for 2006 (intelligentpop.com)
-Featured artist for the 2007 Volkswagen Auto Tour.
-Showcased artist for the 2007 Folk Alliance, Memphis, Tennessee.
-Among the top-ranked unsigned folk artists (myspace.com) 

The beauty of his sound, coupled with the aura of a shy guy, stirs a desire to join the now burgeoning army of Espe’s unpaid publicists. Among his recent surge of supporters is President of CD Baby (America’s largest distributor of independent music), Derek Sivers:

“Aaron, I love your ‘My Whole Life’ CD so much I’m going to feature it on the front page of CD baby for a few days. We get about 100 new albums sent to us a day (about 100,000 total), and yours is one of the best I’ve ever heard!”

Without benefit of the high-powered promotion that hammers mainstream music into our consciousness, Aaron Espe’s fans greedily await the release of his second album, “Songs from a Small Town” (Spring 2008).   <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Aaron+Espe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
