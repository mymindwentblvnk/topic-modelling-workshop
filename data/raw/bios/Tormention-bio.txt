Tormention ( previously Bloodvomit) was created in September 2008. The idea of starting a band came up at Wacken Open Air festival 2008. Adam(Bass) and Amir(Drums) who had played in various different bands together earlier met Daniel(guitar). They sat at their camp sight and started to bond and came up with and idea to start a death metal band. They started rehearsing in September that same year, completing the band with Manne(2nd guitar) and Robin(Vocals). They recorded a demo in 2009 that Patrick Bruss mixed and mastered. But the following year the band went through different changes, letting go of their second guitarist Manne and their vocalist Robin due to his health issues. Though all the set backs Tormention ended the year 2010 with good news, finally completing their band with the outstanding Joakim Mikiver(vocals). They changed their name from Bloodvomit to Tormention, and has now recorded a new demo at Blueflame Production Studio in Uppsala.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tormention">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
