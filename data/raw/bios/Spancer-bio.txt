The Slow, The Loud, And The Heavy!

This is the world where SPANCER dwell in. A world of cathartic doom enjoyment, celebrating the legacy of the heaviest and probably most soulfilled form of rock music imagineable.

As an active band being as slow and laid-back as their music, SPANCER are not out there to fulfill your wishes and follow regulations of general request, but go on just for their own sake and pleasure...and they do it the SPANCER way!

Who needs another fast-but-short-lived fly of the biz? The elephant takes it easy and knowingly enjoys its days. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spancer">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
