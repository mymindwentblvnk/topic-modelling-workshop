Sound of Ground is a stoner metal three - piece from the heart of Russia, Moscow. Comprised of Danila Khromov on guitar, Jan Karlin on drums and vocals, and Denis Makhnev on bass, the band was formed in January 2010. These guys combine heavy riffs of classical hard rock, buzzing sound of early grunge, drenched vocals in English with good songwriting abilites, and are determined to make a mark in the uprising Russia's heavy - rock scene. Their influences are pretty obvious, but the music itself is alive, enjoyable and evocative.

So far, they have released one album, called "Green Turning Light", which contains six tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sound+of+Ground">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
