A band formed by Norberto Rodriguez on vocals, Pablo Catania on keyboards and Ruben Trombini on bass.  After walking away from Walter Giardino Temple after Walter Giardino did not let then play "Burn" with Glenn Hughes arguing that they did not know how to play properly, they formed the band "Quemar" (Spanish for Burn) in 1999, with which they released an album.

 Guitarist Adrián Subotovsky and drummer Alejo García Guraieb are added. In full production of "Quemar", Trombini announces his departure due to musical differences. Norberto Rodríguez then again assumed his dual role as vocalist and bassist.
