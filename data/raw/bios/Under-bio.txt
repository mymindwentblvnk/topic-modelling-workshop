'This amazing album, "More Pleasant Grey" shows us the many sides of Under with the rework of "Keep on Moving" that has a new softer edge with a drum n bass surprise, the haunting and deep sounds of "Berkeley" and some of the tracks you feel in love with from the EP along with some new gems.

But to kick it all off is the beautiful, fun and intoxicating track, "Gravity" which if you were already a fan of Under says welcome back and get ready for an amazing journey... For those who were not a fan yet you will be after hearing this one.' - Julian Lennon
