A visual cross between the leather bondage movie “Cruising” and the raunchy retro-fuelled imagery of early John Waters movies like “Desperate Living,” San Francisco’s queer Hunx and his Punx (one of whom is Seth Bogart of former Gravy Train!!!!) have injected humor, imagination and fun into their prodigious multimedia output, which includes records and videos.

Hunx’s bouncy pop sound is equally cool, melding ‘60s-based bubblegum pop sensibilities with DIY garage prowess for a sticky-sweet aural assault. Starting with his “Good Kisser” single on Austria’s Bachelor Records, Hunx has moved forward with lightning speed and now has three other singles in the offing. Often compared to Arizona's Nobunny, who co-wrote songs for Hunx and his Punx. 

In January 2010, Hunx and his punx began a tour featuring an all-girl backing band. The new line-up has been identified on the tour and in new songs such as "Lovers Lane" as Hunx and His Punkettes.

A release on Atlanta’s Rob’s House Records is already sold out of two separate pressings. Also on the roster are a single from San Francisco’s Bubbledumb Records (which released the original issue of the Nobunny LP) and one on Jay Reatard’s revived Shattered Records.
