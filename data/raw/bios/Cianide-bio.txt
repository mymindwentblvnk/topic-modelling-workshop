Cianide is an American Death/Doom metal band from Chicago, Illinois, founded in 1988.

History:
The band was founded in 1988 by vocalist and bassist Mike Perun and guitarist Scott Carroll. It was followed by the first two demos Funeral and Second Life before Jeff Kabella came to the band as a new drummer. This was followed by Grind Core International's debut album The Dying Truth in 1992, followed in 1994 by A Descent Into Hell. This included a cover version of Slaughter's Death Dealer. After drummer Kabella was replaced by Andy Kuizin, the band went to the studio in late 1995 to record the demo Rage War, which was released in 1996 and later re-released on Cyronics Records. The following year, the next album appeared Death, Doom, and Destruction, where Jim Bresnahan was included as a second guitarist. About Merciless Records followed in 2000, the album Divide and Conquer. Then Bresnahan left the band again, causing the group shrunk back to a trio. In 2005 followed the next album Hell's Rebirth, which was followed by the 2011 album Gods of Death.

Style:
According to Allmusic, groups like Hellhammer, Celtic Frost, Venom and Death heavily influenced the band. According to Metal Hammer's Gregor Arndt, the band plays on A Descent into Hell's old-school Death Metal, with the music "as up-to-date and original as Hellhammer would be in 1994." According to Robert MÃ¼ller of the Metal Hammer, the band plays on Hell's Rebirth classic Death Metal, with Cianide repeatedly slipping into Doom Metal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cianide">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
