The symphonic metal band Eleine has grown a lot in a short period of time.
They have already shared the stage with such bands as Darkane, Sister Sin and Raubtier.
Also they’ve had celebrated performances at venues like Rock Stage Malmöfestivalen, The Tivoli, Babel etc.
 
It all began late 2011 when frontfigure Eleine began working with Cardiac Records.
2012 Rikard Ekberg joined, who today is the bands guitarist and also songwriter along side with Eleine herself.
In the end of 2013 they found three very talented musicians, David Eriksson (drums), Sebastian Berglund (keyboard) and Andreas Mårtensson (bass) to complete the band.

They released their first single along with a music video April 3rd 2014, named "Gathering Storm". 
A second single was released in March 2015 before their self-titled debut album was released by Cardiac Records/Universal April 18th,  and it has been well recieved by both fans and critics. 

Their music is described as heavy symphonic metal that is both stylish and monumental. They deliver a stageshow that both seduces the audience and strike them with a sense of wonder.
 
The lead singer is also a well known name as an alternative model. She has been on the cover of Scandinavian Tattoo Magazine and has modeled for several large alternative companies.
 
In late 2015 Eleine and Cardiac Records went seperate ways. They're now working on new material, stage show and a tour is planned during 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eleine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
