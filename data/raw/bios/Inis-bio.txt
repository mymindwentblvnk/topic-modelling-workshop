1. Inis is an indie pop artist from Indonesia.
A former member of Ilusia Girls, a group put together by Ahmad Dhani, Inis went solo just prior to appearing on 2013’s X Factor Indonesia, eventually becoming one of the Top 10 finalists. Since then, her cover of Adele’s “Don’t You Remember,” followed by “Mother,” demonstrated her exquisite vocal talent.
