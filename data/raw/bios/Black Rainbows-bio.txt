Black Rainbows Formed in 2005. They Started as a joke to have fun with some heavy psychedelic, stoner, desert tunes.  But after recording their first full length “Twilight in the Desert” they were picked up from  Longfellow Deeds Records (a French Rock Label site in Paris). In these years, they continue to smarten up their sound with a dozen live shows, sharing the stage with many cool bands; like Dead Meadow, Black Mountain, Los Natas, Witchcraft,White Hills, Michael Davis from MC5, Vic Du Monte’s Persona Non Grata and Alfredo Hernandez from Kyuss.

Their sound is a mix of seventies, like MC5, Blue Cheer ,Hawkwind, Black Sabbath and recent hard psych, stoner from Kyuss, Monster Magnet, Fu Manchu, Queens Of The Stone Age and Nebula. 

They are now ready with the second chapter: "Camina Diablo" 45 minutes of Heavy-Psych/Stoner Rock, released in red gatefold vinyl, and CD 12 pages booklet by Long Fellow Deeds Records. Artwork was made by Angryblue (the great American Illustrator). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Rainbows">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
