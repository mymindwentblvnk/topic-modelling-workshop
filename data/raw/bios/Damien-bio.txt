1: Damien is a hardcore/metal-band (the expression is worn out, but it works) hailing from Karlstad, Sweden. The band was formed in early 2003 by four guys with lots of experience from other Swedish bands, some more successful than others. Originally, Damien started out as a quartet but after only a few rehearsals a second guitarist was recruited to second evolve the sound and make the live performances heavier and more massive.

After a couple of months rehearsing the band was asked to play the infamous Deadfest in Linköping (Sweden) with bands like Walls of Jericho and Undying. Damien’s performance was a complete success and the response was way better than expected. The band was of course psyched about this and went home to Karlstad to rehearse even more. This resulted in a couple of more live shows and finally a five song demo recording during the summer of 2004.

Once again the response was overwhelming and Damien was elected “Best in Sweden” (band of the month) in Swedens biggest metal magazine, Close-Up Magazine #73. This also resulted in a song (“Trucido”) on the free sampler that comes with every number of the magazine. The feature gave the band attention and a couple of record labels showed their interest in Damien, however, nothing has been signed yet.
