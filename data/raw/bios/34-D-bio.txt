34-D was a  hard core band from Mexico City. The line up consisted of popular radio host El Warpig (Lost Acapulco, Atoxxxico) on bass, Iván Nieblas (El Diablo) on Guitar, Fernando Benítez (The Sweet Leaf, Simio, Raxas, El Diablo, Acrostic, La Orquesta de Animales) and Gerardo Cervantes on Vocals. 

They released a cassette on TOAJ records titled 34-D and won the Best Metal Album category for the Banda Rockera Awards in 1994. Three years later the band split and Iván, Fernando and Gerardo formed El Diablo.

Review from Chronicles of Chaos.com 
by: Adrian Bromley (article submitted 14/7/1997)

This is a good demo and I'll tell you why. This demo showcases us ten songs that are delivered fast, furious, and in a totally reckless fashion: no holds barred intensity. 34-D's demo is yet another release from Mexico City that we are reviewing, a city in a country where metal music is so cherished and loved that fans eagerly await every new metallic release. 34-D is a bar-styled thrash metal/rock outfit with influences from Entombed to Metallica and even Pantera in their music. It's violent and angry and rarely does the anger within the music and lyrics subside. While the lyrics are written and sung in Spanish, not to mention the production of the record not being the best it could have been, the band's ability to hit us right between the eyes almost every song out distracts us from not really comprehending what is being sung. I like this record for the fact that the band has no set agenda on what or how they should play. It seems as though the band had a few beers, plugged in and let it all out. For those who like their music rough. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/34-D">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
