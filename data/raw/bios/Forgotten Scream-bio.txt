Forgotten Scream started as a project back in 2010 in Serbia. Two friends , Julian Voin and Antal Kovac, wrote a song together. The song kick-started the idea to form a band, which was finally realized seven years later in 2017. The band consists of Julian Voin ( guitarist/composer), Nebojsa Grujic (singer), Antal Kovac (lead guitarist), Nikola Nenin (drummer), Jovan Djukic(bass player). Julian, Nebojsa and Antal recorded the debut album "Changes" in 2016 which was released on March 11th, 2017. The album was recorded without the drummer and the bass player , they later joined the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Forgotten+Scream">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
