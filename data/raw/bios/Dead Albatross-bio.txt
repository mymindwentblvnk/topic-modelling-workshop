Dead Albatross are not a death metal band from Texas. They are much more concerned with the anxiety and absurdity of modern existence than themes of impending doom and destruction. Comprised of Melbourne-based multi-instrumentalists/non-musicians Adam Cupitt, Martin Tong and Christoph Walla, Dead Albatross’s approach to music is like a bowerbird’s nesting behaviour, pilfering shamelessly from a headache-inducing variety of influences.

Since forming as a recording project in 2008, they have recorded over eight hours of material, ranging from psychedelic freakouts, to free jazz improvisations, show tunes, jingles, spoken word rants, ambient drones, protest music, porn grooves, as well as actual songs. Condensing these experiments, they have emerged in 2012 with a 22-minute EP of electronic/psychedelic/garage pop music.

Their music is available online at Facebook, Triple J Unearthed and Bandcamp. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+Albatross">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
