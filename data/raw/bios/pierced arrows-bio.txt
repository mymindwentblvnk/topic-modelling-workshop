Lead vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Fred Cole and bassplayer/vocalist Toody Cole along with drummer Kelly Halliburton, formed the PIERCED ARROWS in Portland, OR in 2007, a few months after Dead Moon's disbandment (previous group the Coles and drummer Andrew Loomis had for the past 20 years) in late 2006.
They have already released their first 7" single, including songs In My Brain/Caroline, a full-length album Straight To The Heart (2008) and second 7" which includes Paranoia/Ain't Life Strange (2008).
You can get updates about the band at their official website (www.piercedarrows.com) or their myspace page (www.myspace.com/piercedarrowspdx) which is actually run by the band members themselves.
