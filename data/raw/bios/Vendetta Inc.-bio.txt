Vendetta Inc. was formed in 2011, by Nimród Nemes (bass) and Barna Bartha (guitar). The band took it's final form later in 2012, when Norbert Salgó (drums) and Mátyás József (vocals) joined the group.
The band's main goal is to remind today's metal scene and the world of the uncompromising attitude that metal music once represented, and to bring it back to life.
