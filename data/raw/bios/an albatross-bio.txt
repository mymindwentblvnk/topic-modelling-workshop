An Albatross is an American noise rock band from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States formed in 1999 and known for their chaotic and fun live shows, and a unique, circus-like presentation of their music. The vocals are delivered with an absolutely unapologetic power and projection which mixes with the accompaniment and creates a real wall of complete, often uninterpretable sound.

The message in the music is love, peace, fun, living, bubbling brim life encouragement and acceptance of the other worldly as driving forces of lifestyle.
