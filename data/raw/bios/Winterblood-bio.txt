There are multiple artists named Winterblood:
1) Polar ambient project from Florence, Italy, formed by Stefano Senesi. Minimalist and monotonous soundscapes performed with analog and digital equipment.
2) German black metal band which released their first full-length album "Herbstsehnsucht" in 2013. Their earlier work can easily be considered black metal, however their recent sound has transformed into a post-black metal direction. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Winterblood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
