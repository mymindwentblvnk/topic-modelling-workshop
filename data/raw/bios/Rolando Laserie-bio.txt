Rolando Laserie (*Matas, Cuba, 27 August 1923 - â€ Coral Gables, Florida, USA, 22 November 1998) was a famous Cuban singer whose repertoire consisted of boleros, guarachas and cuban son for the most part. He is famous for his introduction of Cuban colloquialisms into a scene dominated by artists striving to sing in a more "refined" Spanish (both pronunciation and vocabulary-wise). He could interpret any classical or contemporary piece with brilliance. 

Laserie left Cuba after the revolution and continued his career in the United States. He died in a hospital in Florida at the age of 75. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rolando+Laserie">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
