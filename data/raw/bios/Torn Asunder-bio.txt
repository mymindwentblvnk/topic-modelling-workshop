There are two bands called Torn Asunder:
1)From Essex in the UK and
2)From Connecticut in the US.

1)Torn Asunder from Essex, are a group with truely international experience, spanning several decades and styles. The two brothers, Marcus and Spence, have been playing in various bands together for years. The brothers then met up with Gaz and Steevi. Torn Asunder is Gaz's first band as a lead vocalist, having playing guitar in covers bands prior to this.  However, Gaz's vocals prove that he's a true natural at the mike!!! Originally from Surrey and then Allentown, Pennsylvania, Steevi had played in an Allentown based band which had incorporated 6 part harmonies. Steevi, and Marcus used this experience and started to write 3 part vocal harmonies for the songs and the Torn Asunder vocal sound was complete!   
With the recent addition of Joe as lead and rhythm guitar, as well as Marcus proving that he's adept on the lead as well as rhythm guitar, the line-up was completed and the tours begin!
