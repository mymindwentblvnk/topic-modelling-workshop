Angel Rot was a doom/stoner band from the early nineties. They released two demos and recorded a full-length, but it took over six years before it got released. The band was formed by Tom "Five" Guay on guitars, formerly of the shockrock/industrial metal band White Zombie and, on drums, gonzo-artiste Steve Kleiner, who Tom 5 met at Parsons School of Design in NYC. For their first incarnation they recruited bass player Mike Davis, formerly of the obscure 80s band National Pastime. Later line-ups featured drummer George Berz from Dinosaur Jr. and NY Punk celeb Gyda Gash on bass.
