Trae is a Southern rapper from Houston, Texas. With his cousin Z-Ro, he is a part of the underground rap group Screwed Up Click. Trae and Z-Ro, along with Trae's other cousin Dougie D, are the founding members of the group Guerilla Maab.

Trae's trademark is a low, deep, guttural voice. His flow is very fast. In these two areas his style is somewhat reminiscent of Z-Ro's, as well as that of Flesh-N-Bone from Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. Trae sometimes, though not always, mixes multiple vocal layers into his songs.

Trae first gained exposure on the Houston rap scene when he appeared on Z-Ro's album 'Look What You Did to Me'. In 2003, he began his solo career with the album 'Losing Composure'. 'Same Thing Different Day' (2004) and the acclaimed 'Restless' (2006) soon followed. Trae is currently signed to Rap-A-Lot Records.

He was featured in a video called Smash Exclusive: Houston Mic Pass with Lil' Flip, Chamillionaire, Chingo Bling, Bun B, Short Dawg, Big Hawk, and Mike D. He also appeared on the official remix of Yung Joc's song "It's Goin' Down", which earned Joc national attention and became one of the biggest mainstream pop hits of 2006.

"Real Talk" was featured on the soundtrack to the video game Madden NFL 07. Trae won an Ozone Award for Patiently Waiting Artist for Texas. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Trae">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
