In 2005, 4 young Finnish guys, Antti Matilainen - vocals, Teemu HÃ¤nninen - guitars, Teemu Anttila - keyboards and Jari Huttunen - drums, decided to form a strong heavy metal band, with the emphasis on METAL. The guys have all played in other bands and projects, but decided to get together for the formation of Halo Of Shadows. 

With the line-up in place, Halo Of Shadows went into the Watercastle Studio in the early fall of 2005 to record drum tracks for the debut album, with Arttu Sarvanne as the engineer. Later on, the other aspects of the music (guitars, bass, keyboards and vocals) were recorded in various Finnish studios, and guitarist Teemu, who also played the bass on the disc, mixed the album, with a fantastic result for all to hear. 

In early 2006 the young band hooked up with Danish based metal agency Intromental Management, for the purpose of spreading the word on Halo Of Shadows and to obtain a good label deal for the debut album, "Manifesto". In spring 2006 the band signed with Massacre Records for a worldwide album release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Halo+Of+Shadows">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
