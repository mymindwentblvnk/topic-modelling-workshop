Two artists:

1) Wardance was a German band who played melodious Speed Metal. They were founded under the name Destroyer in 1986 in Landau/Pfalz, and renamed themselves into Wardance - based on the Anthrax song "Indians" - two years later. The line-up consisted of singer Sandra Schumacher, guitarists Franz Römer and Thomas Heyer, bassist Markus Wawersich and Stefan Humbert on drums. Shortly after their renaming they released the EP „Crucification“. Due to the good feedback they got a contract with No Remorse Records, where they released their LP "Heaven is for sale" in 1990. They split up in the beginnings of the 90's
