The Tribe was a post-apocalyptic television show from New Zealand, created by Raymond Thompson and Harry Duffin, produced by Cloud 9. It is set in a hypothetical near-future in which all adults have been wiped out by a deadly virus, leaving the children of the world to fend for themselves. The show's focus is on an unnamed city inhabited by tribes of children and teenagers.

During between the second/third seasons the cast of the Tribe released a soundtrack album entitled 'Abe Messiah' featuring tracks from the show as well as entirely new compositions. 

'You Belong To Me' was released as a single in Germany.

During the fourth/fifth season the album was re-released as 'Abe Messiah: Remixed' featuring all of the previous tracks plus slightly re-worked versions of 'Abe Messiah' & 'You Belong To Me' alongside the new theme ' Tribe Spirit' and some of the instrumental music from the TV series. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Tribe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
