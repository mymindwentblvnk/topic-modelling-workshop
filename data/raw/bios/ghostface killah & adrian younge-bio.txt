On September 13, 2012 Ghostface Killah announced that his new studio album would be titled Twelve Reasons to Die, and would be produced entirely by Adrian Younge, and executive produced by RZA. 

He also announced a release date of November 20 2012, through RZA's Soul Temple Records.The album would be pushed back from its original November 20 2012 release date so it would not compete with the soundtrack to RZA's film The Man with the Iron Fists. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ghostface+Killah+&+Adrian+Younge">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
