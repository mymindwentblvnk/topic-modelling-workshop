Enraged was formed in 2005 by Wael O. and Rasha M. as a tribute to female fronted metal bands. The band performed for the first time in late 2005 as a tribute to Evanescence and Lacuna Coil. 

As the interest in original composing grew in Egypt's small community of metal fans, the band gradually shifted their direction towards writing and performing original material. In 2006 the band recorded and performed their first demo "The Truth that Lies Conceal". In 2007, Enraged preformed a complete set list of original music along other Egyptian bands opening for Nervecell in Egypt Metal 6th concert on March that year. A couple of weeks later, the band released another demo song "Ma'at" and from that point and onwards, the band mainly performed original material. As of 2011, Enraged has performed 17 original tracks.

The band approach to metal is experimental. It may be difficult to tag a specific sub genre on the band but the band is mainly influenced by old school heavy metal. The band, however, relies heavily on synth and keyboards which together with being fronted by a female vocalist creates a unique distinctive sound.
ENRAGED explores different themes and topics such as spirituality, individualism, politics and global conflicts.

The band have released their first album "Jeremiad - EP". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Enraged">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
