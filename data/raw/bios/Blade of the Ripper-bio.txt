Adam Neal, formerly of The Hookers, Nashville Pussy, and most recently the Brothers Of Conquest, has resurfaced with a new storm of heavy metal. Drawing from the likes of NWOBHM, American thrash, and European power-metal, Blade Of The Ripper strikes the ears as a heavy band, and at the same time manages to creep into the soul as a violent threat. The members hail from Kentucky. As individuals they were born in the 1970s, grew up in the 1980s, started to come of age in the 1990s, and are now regressing in the new millenium. The Brothers Of Conquest, their most recent attempt at glory, were beaten in the end, brought down by rampant excess, constant line-up shuffling, weird business dealings, paranoia, and a flawed hubris. So must all men fall. But the core of Neal, the charismatic Roads, and the late Tony Rivers remained, and the band was rebuilt and redefined. The disturbing addition of a volatile ex-Hooker (Hamilton) and a mysterious ex-skater (Oerther) completed the persona of the Ripper. As a collective they traded in their declarative, regal approach for a more cunning and deadly weapon: fear. In times of unrest, there is no room for questioning; one can only make demands. With sonic aggression and the power to intimidate, the demons of the mind can be unleashed on the rest of mankind. This new band has set out to take it's music further, beyond a point of no return, as if a passionate murder has been committed. Now the killer must make a choice: to submit and face retribution, or to keep on killing, on and on and on. And from the lower depths, the darkness will rise. And out of the darkness there will emerge a Blade. The urge is primal, the instinct is ravenous, the cut is clean, and the blood is everywhere?
