Hans-A-Plast was a German punk band founded in 1978. Through the characteristic singing of the lead singer Annette Benjamin and their cheeky lyrics they quickly became one of the most successful punk bands of their time. In 1983, the band, consisting of three girls and two boys, dissolved after having released three albums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hans-A-Plast">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
