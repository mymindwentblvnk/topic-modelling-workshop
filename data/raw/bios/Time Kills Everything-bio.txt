Time Kills Everything (side project from the guys from Fuck the Facts) hails from Canada and has a much more "experimental" sound, but equally brutal. Their music includes lots of samples, drum machine and some occasional keyboards, plus insane screams and intricate riffs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TIME+KILLS+EVERYTHING">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
