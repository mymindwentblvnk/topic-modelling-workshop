Winter's Eve are a female fronted London-based Symphonic Gothic Metal band. Key influences include Nightwish, Lacuna Coil and Opeth.

The band began in London, England, in 2008 as the brainchild of guitarist and songwriter Axeman Jim, who sought to create the perfect fusion of gothic beauty, raw metal power and progressive sophistication. The band began gigging on the London circuit in February 2010, quickly garnering rave reviews for their live performances and a loyal following. 

In July 2010 they independently released their debut album "Shards" for download, with a physical release scheduled for September.

Winter's Eve are: Lena (vocals), Axeman Jim (guitars and vocals), Pranay (lead guitars), Storm (bass) and Klepsy (drums).
