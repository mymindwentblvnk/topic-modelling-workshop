Side project of:
- Assassin (Ger)
- Mayhem (Nor)

Formed in December 1986, they only released a demo, probably recorded under the influence of alcohol.

Euronymous and Necrobutcher from Mayhem with Markus, Michael and Robert from Germany's Assassin.

This demo tape never came with any cover, but the cover on this was made by Maniac just for fun. Ã˜ystein thought this was cool so they used this on a few tapes. Recorded onto regular non-studio Cassettes. No lyrics. The letter "C" is omitted from the logo. There's also a notice: 
"All fucking noise and drunken screams by Assassin, Agressor and Mayhem.
