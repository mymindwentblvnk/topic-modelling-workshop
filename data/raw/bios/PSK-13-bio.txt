PSK-13 is a gangsta rapper from the southside of Houston, Texas. He is a member of SPC (South Park Coalition), a pioneering crew that helped define the "H-Town" rap sound. He has a number of albums, including "Born Bad?", "Pay Like You Weigh" and "Flagrant". He is very baller and very gangsta. When he talks about letting the Pyrex pot bubble over, you know he's not running his lip like half these fakes. Peace out. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/PSK-13">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
