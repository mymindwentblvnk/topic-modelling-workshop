PT-BR 
1 -(sic) é um músico, beatmaker e artista visual brasileiro de Belo Horizonte, ex-guitarrista fundador da Burn the Sun (banda de deathcore/techdeath/djent) e ex-baixista na Bélico (antes, uma banda de música brasileira, agora uma banda de um homem só), ambas de belo horizonte.

A assinatura de produção '(sic)' foi escolhida por conta de alguns fatores: primeiramente, é uma implicação comum de textos academicos que indica que a sentença escrita logo antes está incorreta propositalmente ou escrita exatamente como deveria estar; segundo, um esquema matemático com ambos nome e sobrenome que, simplificando e entortando um pouco, chega em '(sic)'; terceiro, é um jogo de palavras com "sickness" (do inglês 'doença', uma pessoa doente, sonoridade doente, doente como em como a foda); quarto, uma referência óbvia e direta à música do Slipknot e, por útlimo, uma referência à banda punk irlandesa que divide esta página com (sic)

ENG
(sic) is a brazillian musician, beatmaker and visual artist from Belo Horizonte, Burn The Sun's former guitar player (a deathcore/techdeath/djent band) and ex-bassist on Bélico (a brazilian music band then, now, a one man band), both from Belo Horizonte. 

The production signature '(sic)' was chosen because of a few factors: at first, it is a common implication from academical texts that indicates the sentence written right before is incorrect on purpose or written exactally the way it should be; second, a mathematical scheme with both his first name and surname that, simplifying and twistting a little bit, comes to '(sic)'; third, it's a wordplay with sickness (a sick person, a sick sound,sic as an as fuck); fourth, it's an obvious direct refference to the Slipknot's song and the last of all, a reference to the irish band that shares this page with (sic).

________________
2 - (sic) noun ~ a three-piece band bringing rock-n-roll swagger, fuck-off tunes and good old Irish sarcasm back to punk rock.

Visiting Dublin for a mad weekend in 1996, Ricky Warwick (of The Almighty and Thin Lizzy) bumped into Ciaran McGoldrick and Gary Sullivan (Drums) at a local gig. Ciaran (whose musical tastes revolve around under-ground US guitar gods such as The Jesus Lizard, Husker Du, Killdozer and Unsane) was earning a paltry living as a guitar technician. Gary (whose roots lay in the musics of punk great along the lines of The Clash, Sex Pistols and The Ruts) had drummed in numerous Irish bands and was looking for a band with a musical style more appropriate to his tastes.

Discovering similar tastes in music, films, books, pubs, drugs virtually everything, (sic) was born. A band with balls, brawn and brains.

(sic)s record was only released in Japan and a four track EP came out in the UK. A huge record deal fell apart at the eleventh hour and the band disintegrated in a world of music business bullshit and loads of drugs.

Now, for the first time ever, the elusive (sic) record is available worldwide to download from the iTunes music store and is called I Feel So Lonely I Could Die. Don't rule out any one-off gigs by the band either !!!
