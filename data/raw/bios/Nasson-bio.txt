Written by Nasson on his myspace page:

'My project is a conjugation of varied musical styles such as Hard Rock, Pop, Electro, and orchestra sections, everything in the right measurement to obtain an elegant, digerible and fresh music.

My first LP, Dying Tears, is based on dark topics, such as murders, psychosis, and suicides. This album was recorded during year 2006, under my own production, where as the mixing and the mastering was in charge of the Chilean producer Javier Bassino who's worked with bands like Six Magics, Fahrenheit, Confesion, Blackout, Alejandro Silva, among others.

The band in my shows is formed by the recognized Chilean guitarist of the band Six Magics, Erick Avila, his brother, Brian Avila (ex-Ethernia) as drummer and Ignacio Elgueta in bass guitar.'
