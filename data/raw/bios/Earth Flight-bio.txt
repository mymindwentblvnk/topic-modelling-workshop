Earth Flight is a rock band from Nuremberg/Germany, jamming together since summer 2004. The founding members are Martin St端llein (Bass), Sebastian Engelhardt (Drums), Andreas Blendinger (Guitar) and Tobias Brunner (Vocals). Their music is mainly influenced by heavy, doomed and psychedelic sounds of the early 70's but taking in account an even wider range of influences to form their individual brand of heavy rock.

In June 2005 Earth Flight released a self-financed 4-track MCD which managed to gain lots of praise and interest within the Doom/Heavy Rock scene. The recordings for the first full-length CD took place in September 2006 and the 9-track album was released one year later through Barbarian Wrath Records in October 2007.

In early 2007 the Flight experienced some turbulances and went through some changes. Therefore they decided to part ways with bass navigator Martin St端llein in February 2007. To keep the sonic vehicle in its full flight two new members joined the band: Sabrina Teleki (Keyboards) and Benjamin M端ller (Bass).

Invigorated by a large number of successful live gigs Earth Flight proves with each show that they are an energetic and diversified force on stage. However the franconian sound operators are still about to navigate further into astonishing realms of sonic sceneries and intoxicating harmonies...

Current Line-Up:
Tobias Brunner - Vocals
Andreas Blendinger - Guitars
Benjamin M端ller - Bass
Sebastian Engelhardt - Drums & Percussion 
Sabrina Teleki - Keyboards
