In Brooklyn early-2009, Izzy Almeida and Derek Watson found each other through a strange and serendipitous meeting at a Chinatown arcade. Shortly thereafter they began plotting their music coup bringing together kindred set of influences: Hawkwind and Karp for Watson, and L7, Melvins, Sonic Youth, for Almeida. 

Self-schooled guitarist Watson writes the music and together he and Almeida weave the melodies and lyrics, turning their harmoniously chaotic way of interacting into beautifully violent, fuzzed-out punk rock. Hunters cut their teeth terrorizing random NYC basements and loft spaces, but soon found a spiritual home at Brooklyn’s renown D.I.Y. venue Death By Audio. After stealing their name from a mutually loved John Waters character from the film Polyester, staring the eccentric Todd Tomorrow (the actor’s real name is Tab Hunter), Hunters began self-releasing several cassettes and 7-inches before finally putting out their first EP Hands On Fire in the fall of 2011. That fourteen-minute exercise in riff-laden music led to tours with JEFF the Brotherhood, Bleached, The Kills and Hunx and His Punx. 

The band solidified its lineup in the summer of 2012 with the addition of Thomas Martin on bass and drummer Gregg Giuffré. In 2013, Hunters signed with Mom + Pop records (Wavves, FIDLAR, Parquet Courts, Sleigh Bells) and completed their self-titled debut album at the famed Electrical Audio studios in Chicago. HUNTERS is slated for release on October 2, 2013.
