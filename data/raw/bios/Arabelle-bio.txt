The music of Arabelle can be perceived as being dark, harsh and uncommon. Arabelle sails upstream against the current tracking her own trail whithout worrying about present standards. The voice of Isabelle Schwarz, her lyrics pregnant with meaning, opens up completely, quivers between roughness and sweetness, oscillates between strength and fragility. Direct, whithout excess, Arabelle elaborates a rock intimist, touching and sincere.
