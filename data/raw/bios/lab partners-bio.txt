Dayton Ohio's LAB PARTNERS formed in 1998 by guitarist/vocalist MIKE SMITH and keyboardist AMY SMITH, the band originally featured lead guitarist KEVIN PARRETT (A Ten O'Clock Scholar) and drummer MATT SCHULZ, who has been a longtime collaborator with Mike Smith dating back from their days together in Honeyburn.  Schulz went on to perform full-time duty with Enon. Today Lab Partners' drum work is handled by KEVIN VAUGHN (Candy Afterlife, Heartless Bastards) and features veteran rocker MIKE VOLK on lead guitar (also formerly of Honeyburn and Let's Crash). Lab Partners also serve as one of the few bands not to include a bass player, with Amy Smith's keyboards and sequencer work uniquely filling in the low end of the rock spectrum. 

Spin Magazine called them the “Band To Watch” and Under The Radar Magazine and Pitchfork Media suing the bands praises as they've continued to tour with the likes of The Warlocks, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Kinski and US Maple.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lab+Partners">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
