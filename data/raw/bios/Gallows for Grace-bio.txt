Gallows For Grace is a technical death metal band from Perth, Australia.

Formed in early 2006, Gallows for Grace is the creation of five like minded musicians aspiring to produce a new sound. As a result, their music has evolved into an original, energetic, brutal and melodic blend of death metal, metalcore and thrash metal with an extremely dark undertone.
A blazing onslaught of technical riffery, lightning fast drumming and crushing guttural vocals, GFG's debut EP attempts to push the boundaries of death metal by blurring the line between traditional and modern styles.
Lyrically, A Process for the Destruction of Tomorrow deals with an apocalyptic theme, warning the human race of the dire consequences of it's desire for war and the effects of mankind's insatiable appetite on the world's resources. The lyrics depict the death of the earth, and tell us the story of mankind's extinction and the rebirth of our planet.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gallows+for+Grace">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
