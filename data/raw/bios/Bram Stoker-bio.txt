Abraham "Bram" Stoker (November 8, 1847 â€“ April 20, 1912) was an Irish writer, best remembered as the author of the influential horror novel Dracula.

'Bram Stoker' is also the name of an obscure British psychedelic/progressive group that was formed in 1969.They gained a cult following in the early 70's, and released an album in 1972 entitled 'Heavy Rock Spectacular'.' The band was  known for its dark and intense sound, largely driven by Tony Bronsdon's Hammond organ textures and leads. They have often been called a "Gothic" progressive rock band, while others emphasize on the similarities to Keith Emerson's "The Nice". In 2008 a compilation album was released by Digimix Records, which includes tracks from the above album as well as previously unreleased tracks.

In 2014, the band surprised the prog world with a follow-up to the debut album after no less than 42 years. While Tony Bronsdon's Hammond organ still is the main ingredient of the songs, the music has departed considerably from the old "The Nice" sound, and it's hard now to spot similarities to other bands.
