Mischosen is a one man band created by Svarog (Xeper, Besthial - drums till 2008). Band started in February 2004. as a keyboard based ambient project under name Frozen Sword. Tranquil, guitar-less demo was to be finished by the end of 2004, but because of technical problems the data was sadly lost. 

It was surely not the end of the band, shortly after new ideas and materials started taking shape. Guitars were added to the songs giving them much more power and creating different atmosphere. Lyrics became deeper, death and afterlife themes were filling the pages. Recording of new material started in July 2007. and was finished in October 2007. Nikola Lakic (Xeper - guitar) came as album guest on guitars. Demo was recorded in Svarog's home studio, and was named "Magic, miracles and rhymes". 

In July of 2008 Mischosen joined Summoning tribute album "...And in the darkness bind them" with cover song "Like some snow white marble eyes". 14 songs were chosen from bands all over the world, all led by Zerivan from Zerivana, who started the project. Zoran-Filip Popov (Ecliptic, Dead within)came as a session member on guitars to record the cover song. 

In  August 2009. Mischosen releases the second full length album called "Set Afloat". Zoran - Filip Popov was again the session member on guitars and a new session member Barbara Barić joined on vocals. Album gained more goth/doom sound but still  had that "old Mischosen" feeling to it.
