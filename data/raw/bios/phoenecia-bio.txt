Phoenecia is an IDM duo from Miami, Florida comprising Romulo del Castillo and Joshua Kay.  In 1995, Phoenecia began as an electro group known as Soul Oddity and released three EPs (Tone Capsule 1, 2, and 3), later released as a one CD album from Astralwerks.

In 1996, they changed their name and became more experimental, while at the same time forming Schematic Records.  Phoenecia tracks have appeared on most of Schematic's compilations, as well as on the anthology Or Some Computer Music 2 [1] (2001) from Or Records.

In 2001, they released their first full length album Brownout.
