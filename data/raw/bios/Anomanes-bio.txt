Anomanes was an extreme metal band from Boston, Massachusetts. Roger Colella (bass/vocals), Dave Henriquez (guitar/vocals), Anderson Fernandes (guitar/vocals) & Sam Jodrey (drums/vocals). By mixing elements of hardcore, thrash, death metal, grindcore and tribal style percussion, Anomanes quickly developed a loyal fan base in the thriving mid 90's Boston punk scene. First to take notice was Bill Damon of Toxic Narcotic. Damon released Anomanes' debut LP "Pronunciation" on his then fledgling label Rodent Popsicle Records. Soon after, the band embarked on their first and last US Tour in August 1996. Combined personal struggle on the road proved detrimental as Anomanes disbanded before completing the summer tour. Only a thousand copies of the band's original debut CD were pressed and even more rare is the pro-shot video for the song "Dying Earth". Very few copies of the video were produced and it was never officially released due to the break up.  After Anomanes' sudden and unexpected demise, Colella and Henriquez formed a heavy metal/grind core band called The Buddha and released the LP; "Reveal The Truth" while Fernandes tried his hand re-forming Anomanes with a new line-up. Both groups were short lived. Damon then recruited Jodrey as the drummer of Toxic Narcotic.
