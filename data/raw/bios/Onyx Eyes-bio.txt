Onyx Eyes combines playful but powerful guitars, pumping bass guitar and drums, keyboard, and an amazing female voice. 

At the end of 2005 Ines, Sören, Denise and Jörg (Josch) left their former band due to musical divergences concerning the new album. A short time later they founded "Onyx Eyes." By the beginning of 2006 the band's lineup was completed by Alexender (Alex) and Martin (Mart). "Delights and Tears" was written, recorded, and produced within two years. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Onyx+Eyes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
