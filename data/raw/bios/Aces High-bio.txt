2. Aces High is a blues/jem American band.
3. Aces High is a Scottish heavy metal band.
4. Aces High is an American metal band based in Los Angeles.
5. Aces High was formed in 2008 out of the sheer desire to pay tribute to the best heavy metal band in history. The focus was to bring incredibly faithful reporoductions of live Iron Maiden songs to as many fans as possible, knowing that the opportunities for Maiden fans to see them live are few and far between in North America. Add to this the fact that Iron Maiden rarely (if ever) play in Las Vegas and that there is a real resurgence of Iron Maiden in the "next Generation" of younger metal-heads and it became obvious that a band was needed to bring this music to those metal-heads who can't travel or are notold enough to travel to see Iron Maiden live.

Aces High take pride in the faithful note-for-note and high energy reproduction of Iron Maiden's live performances. The band works very hard to insure that any song they play is worthy enough to "chant" along to. They are also looking forward to bringing the full stage experience you would expect of an Iron Maiden concert to a stage near you in the near future!
