We are Tacit Fury
[Death Metal Squad]

Reformed in late 2010, Tacit Fury recorded and released "Horrors From Depth" through well known Russian record label FONO LTD. Not long after the release, the band announced plans for a full length album, music video and 20+ date tour covering Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine, and Russia. The music video for "Lacerated, Strangled, Impaled" has gained the band new fans and has also built heavy anticipation for new music. The new record was released on March 18th, 2014 under the name "A Social Berserker " and received predominantly positive feedback. Tacit Fury is continuing to grow as a band and is showing no signs of slowing down.
Line-up:
Dmitry “Enoth” - guitars/vocals,
Alexander “Imidazo” - drums,
