UK based five-piece melodic metal band Orestea formed at the end of 2008.

With their hard graft approach and down-to-earth workethic they soon self-released their debut EP, 'Shadows Of Yesterday' and followed this not not long after with the full-length 'Love Lines & Blood Ties.'

Orestea are about to release their 3rd CD - 'This Is An Overture' which will be out on September 10th 2012.
