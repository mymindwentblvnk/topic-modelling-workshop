Ancient Blood is a melodic black metal band from Monterrey, Mexico. The band had a short period of activity from 2008 to 2010 (but never was a structured project). Not until early 2012 when the band began to be active. 
Now the band are promoting their first demo "Damnation And Bloodlust", with this stuff the band seeks make know their music: melodic black metal with influences of bands as Emperor, Cradle Of Filth, Dark Funeral, Dimmu Borgir and Covenant.

Both words that forms the name of the band have different meanings: "Ancient" refers to the ancient representations of the Death in mexican culture and "Blood" is in reference of Vlad The Impaler. The concept of the band's name means "death and blood"(the two principal lyrical themes of the band).
