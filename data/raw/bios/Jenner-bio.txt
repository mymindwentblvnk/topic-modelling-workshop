Jenner is all female speed/thrash metal band in Serbia. The band was formed in December 2013 by sisters Alexandra (guitar) and Marija (drums) with the goal of following their influences Judas Priest, Warlock, Grim Reaper... Their friends Andjelina (vocals) and Jana (bass) joined the band and they started covering their favourite songs of bands that are already mentioned. After spending more time together and acquiring Alexandra, they took on a more ferocious and faster sound in the likes of Anthrax, Overkill, Exodus, Agent Steel... After a year of work, Jana were replaced by their current bassist, Mina and girls immediately started working on their own songs. Soon, they released Demo 2015, for the further band promotion and submission to Serbian famous Guitar festival in Zajecar which contained two songs, "Hear the Thunder Roar" and "On the Judgement Day" uploaded only on Jenner's official Youtube channel. The audience in Serbia and even in other countries loved the demo, so they begun working on the debut album. Marija were on a maternity leave for a year, so their good friend Selena Simic (Nemesis, Goatmare and the Hellspades) helped them with some gigs and finishing their debut album "To Live Is To Suffer", released by french label, Inferno Records on 20th of February 2017.
