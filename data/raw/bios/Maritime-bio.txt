Maritime is an American indie-pop band formed in Milwaukee in 2003 after the breakup of The Promise Ring and The Dismemberment Plan. 

After these two bands broke up, singer/guitarist Davey von Bohlen, drummer Dan Didier (of The Promise Ring) and bassist Eric Axelson (of The Dismemberment Plan) hooked up and started a band called In English. The group quickly signed a deal with the record label,ANTI-, and hired J. Robbins to produce their record. Robbins had previously produced records for both The Promise Ring and The Dismemberment Plan. After delivering the record to ANTI-, the label heads decided to pass on the record. The band changed their name to Maritime and signed with DeSoto Records. The band went on tour and self-released an EP called Adios on their own label, Foreign Leisure. On April 1, 2004 the band released their debut full-length album, Glass Floor on Desoto Records.

On February 6th, 2006, Eric Axelson announced he was leaving the band. He was replaced on bass guitar by Justin Klug.

Their second album, We, the Vehicles, was released April 18th, 2006 to wide critical acclaim along with a third, Heresy and the Hotel Choir in October 2007 on Flameshovel Records.

In 2011 Maritime returned with the album Human Hearts, featuring the single "It's Casual."

Magnetic Bodies/Maps of Bones was released in 2015.
