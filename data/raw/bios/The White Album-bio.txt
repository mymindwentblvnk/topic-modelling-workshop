The White Album is a Danish band from Copenhagen consisting of three very good friends with big beards and very big hearts.
Rooted in folk and indie rock, they make music that trascends structural boundaries of both practical and musical nature. Everybody is a frontman in this band as each distinct voice and composition finds its place in a soulful conglomerate of well-seasoned musical spirits.
Just as the original White Album, thereâ€™s no right or wrong. Just ideas. Mostly wonderful ones. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+White+Album">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
