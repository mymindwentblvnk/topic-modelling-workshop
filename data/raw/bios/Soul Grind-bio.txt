*Not to be confused with Soulgrind from Finland or the US.

Soul Grind is a symphonic death metal band from Italy. The band was formed in 1997 and throughout their career (1997-2001) they have released 2 albums. Their first album was a full-length release (1998) called "The Darkest Dawn." Their second release was an EP called "Lacerans." They are among the first bands in the world who actually played symphonic death metal (which is still a different sub-genre from the original melodic death metal). They used many keyboards/orchestrations, which was quite unusual for that time. Many melodic guitar riffs and fast drumming are present as well. Their first release has a very modern sound and is, even today, among the top-notch music of this genre. However, on their second release (Lacerans), they left the keyboards out and played guitar-driven melodic death metal. The band split up in 2001.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Grind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
