1)  Melodic Death/Thrash Metal From Västerås, Sweden
The story of Vittra began mid 2017 when David (vocals) and Johan (guitar) met via Bandfinder where David posted an ad, searching for musicians. 
After a first call they decided to meet and immediately started to write music. The first song created was ”Modest Charade”, based on a melody line created by David where Johan added the riffing/chords. David wrote the lyrics and they jointly set the song structure.
Main influences discussed at the start were bands such as Dissection and early In Flames as well as Megadeth, At the Gates and other similar thrash and melodic death metal bands.

They soon began to search for fellow musicians, but it wasn’t until approximately a year later that Alex, who used to play guitar with David in a previous band, came in on drums. He also managed to bring with him Gustav on bass, so mid 2018 the line up as we know it today was complete.

The name of the band started as “Vildvittra”, based on the characters created by Astrid Lindgren as part of “Ronja Rövardotter” (Ronia, The Robber’s Daughter). It later evolved into Vittra, inspired by some mythical creatures appearing in Swedish folk tales.

On February 26th, 2021 they released their debut single "Necrotic Apocalypse". In April 2021, their debut EP Wardens, recorded at Solnasound Productions in Sweden, will be released.


2)  Vittra is a newly started project whose
goal is to create Swedish black metal.

The band consists of Lars Bakken and Oskar Öberg
and the first, self titled demo was written, recorded
and mixed in four days. 

To date, the three track demo is the only thing that Vittra has made. The discography should expand during the Autumn of 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vittra">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
