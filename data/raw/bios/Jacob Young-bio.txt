2) Jacob Young (born Jacob Wayne Young on September 10, 1979 in Renton, Washington) is an American soap opera actor and singer. He was raised in Tillamook, Oregon and Roy, Washington, and moved to San Diego, California at age 17 with his mom. In the summer of 2006, he became engaged to his long time girlfriend Christen Stewart, a model.

He played Rick Forrester on the CBS soap The Bold and the Beautiful from December 31, 1997 to September 15, 1999. He was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award as Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series in 1999.

Jacob played the part of Lucky Spencer on General Hospital for three years from February 25, 2000 until February 10, 2003. In 2002, he won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor and was named "Sexiest Soap Star" by People magazine.

Even though he does not appear to be a large guy, he is very muscular and well-toned, having been a wrestler in high school. In an interview some years ago, he admitted that he purposely wore a loose-fitting shirt to his GH audition so he wouldn't look too muscular. He was replacing Jonathan Jackson, who was quite thin.

Young has played the character of Adam "J.R." Chandler, Jr. on All My Children since October 1, 2003. In 2005, he was again nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award as Outstanding Younger Actor.

He played "Hunter" in the movie "The Girl Next Door." From May through August 20, 2006, he starred in Disney's Beauty and the Beast on Broadway, in the role of Lumiere. 

On September 11, 2001, Artemis Records released Young's self-titled CD.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jacob+Young">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
