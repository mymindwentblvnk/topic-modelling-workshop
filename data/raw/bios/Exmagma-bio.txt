Exmagma were a German psychedelic jazz rock trio in the seventies, that's also sometimes associated with krautrock and the Canterbury scene. Their music is influenced by The Soft Machine, among others. Trippy jams, avant-garde experiments (bordering on free jazz) and groovy improvisations are the main ingredients of their sound. They recorded three albums, one of which wasn't released until 2006.
