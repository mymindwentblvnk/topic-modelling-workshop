Tiles is a progressive rock band formed in Detroit, Michigan, USA in February 1993. Tiles features Mark Evans (drums), Chris Herin (guitar), Paul Rarick (vocals), and Jeff Whittle (bass). It is signed to InsideOut Music in North America and Europe. Since its formation, the band has developed and refined a sound that blends experimental progressive rock overtones with an aggressive hard rock edge. Mixed with lyrics of an "observational" or "human experience" quality, Tiles continues to cultivate a sound that rewards more than just passive listening. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tiles">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
