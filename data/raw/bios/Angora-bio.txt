Short-lived band formed some time after the breakup of The Heart Throbs. Rose Carlotti and Steve 'Bes' Wick continued on from this band, and would resurface again under the name of Tom Patrol, after Angora's sole release, the "Pretty Nothing/Shattered" 7" single.


 About ANGORA 
Phiadelphia Hard Rock act ANGORA came together during the mid 80s,the band comprising of singer JOHN CORABI with JIMMY MARCHIANO on lead guitar, FRANK SCIMECA on bass and ROBERT IEZZI on drums. In late 1986 the group relocated to Los Angeles, soon securing the interest of KISS bassist GENE SIMMONS who suggested a name change to 8 BALL ( 4 guys 8 balls). Opting to retain the ANGORA tag the group worked the clubs and in 1988 laid down the track" SHAKE SHAKE", produced by Rob Cavallo (green day) at Rock Steady Studios in Hollywood,for inclusion on Los Angeles radio station KNAC's unsigned artist album "Son Of Pure Rock"......ANGORA folded, with Marchiano returning to Philadelphia were he made his mark with LECOMPT, followed by HEAVENS EDGE and BLACK EYED SUSANN, before a return to LACOMT. In 1989 Corabi forged THE SCREAM in a union with RACER X veterans John Alderette and Bruce Bouillet. Signing to Hollywood Records THE SCREAM issued a solitary album. ROBERT IEZZI and FRANK SCIMECA formed THE GRAVEYARD TRAIN out of the ashes of angora with singer TODD GRIFFIN and BRUCE DRAPER on guitar. They were quickly signed to Geffen Records, despite a commendable album THE GRAVEYARD TRAIN was put to rest. Corabi was pulled into the big time league in Feb.1992 when he was invited to join "MOTLEY CRUE"......Later works include 3 albums with UNION a collaboration with ex- KISS guitarist BRUCE KULICK and a small touring stint with rat.
