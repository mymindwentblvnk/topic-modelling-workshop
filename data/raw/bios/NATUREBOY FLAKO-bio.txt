Chilean-born, Guerra grew up in Germany, lived in London before returning to Berlin in late 2015. The exposure to different cultures opened his horizons, finding common ties between all worlds. Although he speaks Spanish, German and English he believes the one true universal language is music. 

After releasing his critically acclaimed Debut Album called "Natureboy" in 2015, Natureboy Flako continues his search for balance, in both his life and his music. Whether heâ€™s composing in his Berlin studio or performing live, Dario Rojo Guerra is constantly exploring contrasting tempos, textures and moods. This theme of balance was further explored on his last release, Natureboy Flako, a self-titled EP in which Guerra united his work as Flako with the natural themes of the Natureboy identity explored in his debut album. He combines live instrumentation, synthesizers and his own voice into a series of rich, reflective and detailed cinematic compositions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/NATUREBOY+FLAKO">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
