Cadaverous Suppuration was a one-man goregrind project from Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany. The sound could be described as old-style, lo-fi, raw and minimalist goregrind with death metal hints in the vein of bands like Dead Infection, Malignant Tumour, Pathologist, Ulcerous Phlegm, etc. Magnus Lundberg - the man behind the project - also formed a similar project soon after called Carnal Shroud (whose name later changed to Ulcerrhoea) and ran Putrid Nausea Productions. He later went on to play in other such projects Netjajev Society System and Syphilitic Vaginas. After about 4 years in existence and 4 tapes released, Magnus stopped activities with Cadaverous Suppuration but continued with Carnal Shroud/Ulcerrhoea.
