Deerhoof is an American independent music group formed in San Francisco in 1994. While it began as an improvisational bass/harmonica solo project of Rob Fisk (subsequently in 7 Year Rabbit Cycle, Common Eider, King Eider), it currently consists of founding drummer Greg Saunier, bassist and singer Satomi Matsuzaki, and guitarists John Dieterich and Ed Rodriguez. Initially performing improvised noise punk, Deerhoof became widely renowned and influential in the 2000s through self-produced creative output combining "noise, sugary [pop] melodies, and an experimental spirit into utterly distinctive music". They have released a dozen or more studio albums since 1997; their album "Mountain Moves" was released in September 2017.

Pitchfork labeled Deerhoof as "the best band in the world.” The New York Times described them as “one of the most original rock bands to have come along in the last decade.” From their humble beginnings as an obscure San Francisco noise act, they've become one of indie music's most influential bands with their ecstatic and unruly take on pop.
