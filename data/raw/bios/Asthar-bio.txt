On the road since February-2001, Asthar has a lot to celebrate. The band comes conquering more and more fans, not only in its native town Betim (Minas Gerais, Brazil) but also in the big capital Belo Horizonte City and others states. 

The quartet is formed by: Mauro Costa Jr (Lead Singer and Keyboards), Toninho Costa (Guitars), Matheus Costa (Drums) and Henrique Rodrigues (Bass). 

Who listens to the Asthar's music can notice how the band has a special care when composing the instrumental of its songs. The result could be defined like something that carries the rock progressive identity, but also with guitars sounding as metal.

The single cd "The cradle", released in July-2005, is the band's first official phonografic work. It's almost 20 minutes of music, divided in 3 tracks composed by the band: “Mandala”, “The return” and“Cradle of light”. This cd is also a boundary-line to the end of the band's formation as a quintet - with the left of one member in the ending of 2005, Asthar decides to go on as a quartet, keeping the band only with the four original musicians.
