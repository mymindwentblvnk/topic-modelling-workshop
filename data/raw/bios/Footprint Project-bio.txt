Nine jung gentlemen and a singing lady are just rising up on the german musical firmament. Thanks to their unique sound they already left footprints in the sand of many hearts. With beatbox and brass-section and the lovely voice of Rokhaya Niang these fledgling artists developed their very own style. A groove-mosaic of changes in rhythm, tempo and key and a whole lot of power. Jazz and Funk melt into Dubstep, House, HipHop and Ska and are send into the bouncing crowd in terms of positive energy. Jump around - have fun!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Footprint+Project">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
