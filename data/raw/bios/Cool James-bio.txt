Cool James, real name James Dandu, also known as 'Mtoto wa Dandu' ( b. 1970 in Mwanza, Tanzania, d. August 27, 2002) was a Tanzanian musician.

Having finished his primary studies in Tanzania, he moved with his parents to Sweden. James wanted to study mathematics but could not do so because they only taught it in Swedish. He chose to study music instead and ended up enjoying it.

His professional musical career started in 1983, he released his first musical album in 1986, already a dance-oriented production. In 1988 he got together with another East African named Andrew Muturi to form the group Swahili Nation. After a while they let a brother of Andrew join the group, and after that yet another brother. James left two years after setting up the group and started promoting himself and his entertainment work.

In 1993 he and Black Teacher formed the group Cool James & Black Teacher. They released only one album, the 1994 record called Zooming You. It included many hits, especially the song Dr. Feelgood.

A while after the Cool James and Black Teacher project James moved back to his home continent and started making Swahili hip hop as well as more African style music. In 1999 he released album Africa's Most Wanted using the name CJ Massive.

James said he was inspired by musicians such as Koffi Olomide, Kanda Bongo Man, Puff Daddy and Michael Jackson.
