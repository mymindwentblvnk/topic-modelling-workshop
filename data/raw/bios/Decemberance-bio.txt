The experimental doom death quintet DECEMBERANCE was formed in Athens, Greece, in September 1997. With some changes to the original line-up, their first demo, titled "Decemberance", came out in January 1998 and obtained some great reviews from the Greek media. Their second demo release, titled "Just a Blacklad...", came out in January 2001 with equivalent response by the press, giving them the opportunity to support such acts as Marduk (2001), Candlemass (2002) ,Kaamos (2003), Saturnus and Misanthrope (2008) as well as many Greek bands.

After some new line-up changes, the band, assuming a different perspective on sound, recorded the "Time" Promo CD which was just a part of their concept debut album, titled “Inside”!  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Decemberance">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
