HUMANITY DELETE was originally formed sometime around 2003 by Rogga Johansson (Paganizer, Ribspreader, Demiurg, Bone Gnawer and many, many more). Some demo material was recorded but it was put aside for many years. In 2012, the band was resurrected from the dead, so to speak. Rogga single-handedly recorded 11 of the most preternatural, grinding, raw, dirty and ugly death metal tracks imaginable with a grind/punk approach. Jill Girardi (Dead Beat Media), who has been living in Malaysia for about three years, was asked to write lyrics with the theme of Asian ghosts and creepy legends. Anyone who has read up on the ghost lore of Asia knows it is one of the most terrifyingly haunted regions of the earth. To make it even better, Lasse Pyykk√∂ (Hooded Menace, Phlegethon, Ruinebell) was recruited to add a few solos to the music, giving it an even rawer feeling! To quote Lasse, "Think 'Kerry King' with a bad hangover!'" The debut CD from HUMANITY DELETE will be titled "NEVER ENDING NIGHTMARES" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Humanity+Delete">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
