Berlin-based songwriter/producer/singer Georg Levin has set his own mark within the international electronic music scene right from his very first release "When I'm With You" in 2001.

Georg has been writing songs since his childhood, playing in various bands as a keyboarder and saxophone player as well as experimenting with primitive recording equipment. He studied Communications in the UK, had a few jobs in the TV and film business in London and Berlin and was just thinking of starting a career with something decent when he met Alexander Barck from Jazzanova, co-founder of Sonar Kollektiv, and became serious about fulfilling his lifelong dream of releasing his own music.

In September 2003, Levin's first solo-album "Can't Hold Back" including the singles "When I'm With You", "(I got) Somebody New" and "In Your Car" hit the stores and the following tour with DJ, labelmate and production partner Dixon set the foundation for his current project WAHOO: Formerly Georg's and Dixon's imprint for remixes (i.e. Jazzanova's "That Night", Victor Davies' "Runaway Train" or Brook's "Colour Me Bad"), they are now working on an album with own compositions.

Their latest offering is the flip of their first single "Take Over Me/Make 'Em Shake It", released on Sonar Kollektiv in September 2004, now re-released by Defected Records including remixes by Kings Of Tomorrow, Isol√©e and Kenny Dope.

While mainly focusing on the forthcoming WAHOO Album (due in April 2006), Georg is also producing and writing songs for other artists such as longtime musical partner Clara Hill, as well as working on further solo material. His next single "Leisure Suit" will be out on Sonar Kollektiv in early 2006 . <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Georg+Levin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
