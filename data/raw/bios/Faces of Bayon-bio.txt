In the Autumn of 2008 Faces of Bayon was formed in Fitchburg, MA by Matt Smith (WarHorse, Engorged), Ron Miles (Scattered Remnants, Twelfth of Never), Nate Westerlind (Acephalus, Ratobasher, Kyklops), and Matthew Davis (Labryntheory, Twelfth of Never, Blackened Chapel). Matt Smith and Ron had been talking about forming a band that incorporated doom metal but also had a psychedelic edge and they finally got together with Nate and started jamming. Matt Davis was recruited after about two jam sessions and the first line-up of Faces of Bayon was formed. In April 2009 Nate left the band and Faces of Bayon decided to continue on as a three-piece. Their debut album, "Heart of The Fire" will be released on Ragnarok Records sometime during Winter 2010-11, stay tuned for details.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Faces+of+Bayon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
