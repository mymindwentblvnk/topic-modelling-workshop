Totalselfhatred is a Finnish depressive black metal band, formed in Helsinki, Finland in 2005. 

The band was found to create truly melancholic and desperate soundscapes, to unravel the blackened thoughts, the blessing and the curse of the inability, to think either black or white nor inbetween. To narrate about the ability to find clarity in madness positivity in the negativity shelter in the dark. To point it out clear! The band is dedicated to the searching. Not to the self-pity. Totalselfhatred is a symbol for ressurrection through pain. A pool for the frustrated, for the despereate in life, for those living and bleeding towards a higher truth. To crush the circles of self-inflicted suffering! For I am my worst enemy...  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Totalselfhatred">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
