HELEL, in Hebrew, means "Lucifer".
Through a mechanic stream of noise and madness,
This entity conveys the Light, the Path towards the Absolute.

Unleashing a torrent of noise from the decaying landscapes of the modern age, HELEL oppresses the unwary with four brutal tracks of industrialised insanity.
Marching under the banner of the light bringer, "A Sigil Burnt Deep Into The Flesh" rages from the darkness, wreaking devastation with its tangible aura of atrocity and alienation, bringing stark revelations of madness and desolation. Bludgeoning the senses with their relentless hammering attack, these four tracks present a concerted and resolute assault on mundane and shallow perceptions of reality, revealing the dark and treacherous path towards the Absolute.

The First Revelation namely "A Sigil Burnt deep into The Flesh" was released through Debemur Morti Productions in February 2009.
