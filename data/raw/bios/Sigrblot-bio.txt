Sigrblot is a black metal band from Sweden formed in 1996. Although often associated with NSBM, the band does not consider themselves to be a a part of that scene: “We really don’t have any opinion in particular about this scene, being neither a National Socialist group nor a black metal band.” The members are unknown. Lyrical themes are often about racial philosophy, esotericism, and religion.
When they released their full-length album "Blodsband (Blood Religion Manifest)" they got good reviews and many saw the album as one of the best that has been released for a long time in the black metal scene. The band's later releases moved more into a dark folk direction. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sigrblot">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
