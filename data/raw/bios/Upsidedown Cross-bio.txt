After the band Kilslug split up, singer Lary Lifeless and ex-Kilslug members Cheez and Scott formed Upsidedown Cross. They also brought in ex-Kilslug member Rico Pertoleum to record their first album Evilution for Taang records. After the first record, Rico got kicked out and was replaced by J Mascis (Dinosaur Jr, Deep Wound), who also played drums on their second, self-titled album Upsidedown Cross. For the rest of the nineties the band had many different line ups. Seth Putnam of Anal Cunt joined the band in 1999 on guitar, and was replaced by ex-Anal Cunt guitarist Josh Martin after Seth had moved from Boston to Texas. Now Seth is back, but the status of the band is unknown. Larry, Josh and Seth are also in a band called Adolf Satan. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Upsidedown+Cross">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
