Leschea was also part of the group Masta Ace Incorporated. Leschea / Born and raised in the Bedford Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn NY, this gifted artist began singing and performing at the age of eight. With no formal training, she honed her vocal and performing skills in school productions from junior high to junior college. In 1995 she sang background vocals on "Masta Ace's" album, "Sittin on Chrome" which subsequently landed her a deal with Warner Bros. records in 1996. In 1996 she scored chart success with the singles "How We Stay," and "Fulton St.," . Fueled by a strong street promotions campaign and two singles, her buzz grew heavy in the summer of 1997. Her most popular single, "Fulton St." was top 10 best selling single in NYC for seven weeks. Some say her debut album, "Rhythm & Beats" was prematurely released and never got the attention it deserved. Her music videos also became hits on BET, peaking in the top twenty of the network's weekly most-played. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Leschea">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
