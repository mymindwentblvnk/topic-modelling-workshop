The Peanut Butter Conspiracy was a psychedelic folk rock band from Los Angeles in the 1960s. Several members had comprised the earlier band The Ashes, but with the addition of vocalist Barbara "Sandi" Robison, changed their name and adopted a somewhat cleaner, more sophisticated sound, rather like Jefferson Airplane crossed with Mamas & the papas. The band recorded three albums and a handful of demos before splitting up in 1969. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Peanut+Butter+Conspiracy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
