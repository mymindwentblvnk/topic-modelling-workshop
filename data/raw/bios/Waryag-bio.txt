The band started in spring 2009, when four descendants of the collapsed Soviet Union met in Berlin and decided to play some heavy thrashing tunes. One of the members left in early 2010, and WARYAG has carried on as a trio:

Daniel Maso - Guitars,
Arsenij - Bass/Vocals
Ilya aka Hog - Drums

The band is named after Variag, a russian cruiser which heroically undertook a battle against 20 or so japanese ships. After having sunk a couple of them, the ship's command decided that Variag should sink itself. This event has been hailed as one of the most heroic acts of the russian fleet. 

The second half of the band's name is written in cyrillic, and the name is pronounced WARYAG.

So far, WARYAG has recorded a 24-minute demo, which consists of 6 tracks.
One of the tracks is also on the compilation "YAZVA" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Waryag">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
