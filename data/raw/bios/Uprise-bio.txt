Uprise began in late 2007 with founding members, Pete Montiel and Louie Galvez. The two young men decided to unify their shared passions for music and God by writing music that is different and bold, music with positive lyrics that people from all different walks of life can relate to and appreciate. A few close friends quickly learned of the new project and jumped at the opportunity to join. Uprise now consists of Pete Montiel on guitar, Gez Sanmiguel on drums, Rob Burnside on lead guitar, James Diaz on bass and Louie Galvez as lead vocals. The five members have made it their goal to infuse excitement, energy and truth into every song and performance. Because their individual musical backgrounds are so diverse, they do not hold back when it comes to exploring different sounds. Their lyrics are very catchy but also a breath of fresh air that brings hope and encouragement to many. Some of their underlying themes are not allowing the past get the better of you or define who you are, but standing true to what you believe and most importantly, recognizing that we are never alone. Uprise is and forever will be the hard-hitting, inspiring group of guys that will leave a mark wherever their music is heard. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Uprise">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
