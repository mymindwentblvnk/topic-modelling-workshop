The band SOUL CAGES comes from Hemer (Germany) and was formed in December 1990. The music is influenced by lots of different kinds of music-styles and sounds and could be described as „melodic Art-Rock combinated with progressive influences“. The most important thing for SOUL CAGES is, that the songs get interesting sounds of harmonies in combination with the sound of lead-and backing-vocals. The creation of the untypical sound of music should knowingly show the listener different feelings. The realisation is reflected in combination of the lyrics with the music.

In spring 1992 SOUL CAGES released their first official demo-tape. It got lots of very good reviews in a lot well known magazines in Europe and some songs of this tape were published on different CD-Sampler and MC-Sampler.

In December 1992 SOUL CAGES signed the record-deal at MASSACRE-RECORDS. In 1993 the band recorded their first album. The debut-CD, called "Soul Cages", was released in May 1994. It was published in Europe and Japan. After the publication of the debut, SOUL CAGES played some live gigs with such well-known bands like SAXON and GOLDEN EARRING.

The recordings of the second album were made at the end of 1995. The second SOUL CAGES-CD, called "Moments", was released in February 1996. In March/April 1996 SOUL CAGES were on tour with "SAVIOUR MACHINE" from the USA and "VENI DOMINE" from Sweden for about three weeks. Live gigs with well-known bands like RAGE followed.

Afterwards SOUL CAGES worked at new material for their third album and did several pre-productions during the time. The recordings of the last and actual album called "Craft" were made in the "Skyline-studios" in Düsseldorf in March 1999. The producer was Matthias Black. The album was released in August 1999. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Cages">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
