Mirco Niemeier is a true veteran or as he would say a pioneer. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, he had the chance to listen to open minded music and so he savored to the fullest. At this time he was inspired by synthesizer sounds, created by Jean Michel Jarre, which smooth the way for electronical music. Percussion and atmosphere: His style is full of deep-tech elements and mixed up with melancholic leads. The groove is always at the forefront and provides a frisky and swingin mood. But you canâ€™t define a certain Mirco Niemeier sound, because he loves to create a lot of elements into one great whole. With releases on PlayWithUs (Kiddazfm Group), Style Rockets, Parquet Recordings, Finnschalplatten, DAMM and Deich Records is Mirco Niemeier arrived at the sound he is producing today.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mirco+Niemeier">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
