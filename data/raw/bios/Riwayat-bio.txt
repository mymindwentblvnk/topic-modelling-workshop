RIWAYAT was diabolically forged since 1995.Started with genre Black Metal..when Black Doom Sri Mayang Kala got the idea to the name of RIWAYAT for his own Black Metal band on 2005.The birth place was way up in the north-west region of Peninsular Malaysia,a state called Perlis-a district called Beseri,Padang Besar Malaysia which translated will mean "Shining Arise".An area infested with convertism and the moral majority types-but nothing cold keep these rabid guys from their inspired noises.
 Riwayat rules the scene in delivering Black Metal in their life about hatre,death,life,happiness,sadness,madness and evil.
 The message is about the human life and the journey through their evil n kindness soul..may them choose its better..until the terrific vision came by two angels sending by God to take them away from this world.Yeah..thats what are we talking about .Regardless,world war has no end ..we are not encourage it start again,peace.Nevertheless,The War between Human and Satan is never end..This is Riwayat are all about..
 
One of the most memorable experiences so far is 2009 : Throughout their journey, RIWAYAT has played alongside some of the biggest name in Malaysiaâ€™s Metal scene, including Sil Khannaz,Brain Dead,Hayariva,Mistik,Dreaded,BilHarzia,Samartary,Dawn Phenomenon,Vociferation Eternity and Predicated Not Defined. RIWAYAT are hell's declared as a band since Black Doom Sri Mayang Kala as known as black is the old ancient guy in malaysian metal scene and had created and performed several band since black's life year by year since 1995: "TRAVUM(R.I.P)1995","METAPHORS(R.I.P)1999","SACRIFICED(R.I.P)2002","MAKAM(Langkawi Island)2003","DARK ABYSS(Kedah)2004" lastly nowadays "RIWAYAT(Perlis)" .And now Black continued his band "RIWAYAT" with his OldTimer Godfather 'Bro D',the ultimate old school heavy metal bass players and song creator.Bro D is the Olders Rockers in the band who had very much experience in his own studio management (EROSI Studio),rock music arrangement,Dj,music entertainment and live performance.He also a bass player of his own band "EROSI".Hail!.Popo who performed in the band "EROSI" , "SpanLuish" and "Secret" now become as a lead guitar possession in "RIWAYAT" and he have good experience in fender n jamming session also had a good metal spirit.He like to explore about metal and underground music!.Fayzen as lead & rythmn guitar.Beside,he possessed as lead guitar in the band called "Secret" and also be the rhytmn guitar in "Erosi".Our New Heavy Metal Vocal,AKeyRon who entered the band with metal spirit and he also a guitarist.He is nephew to the drummer of the band called "Jinbara(Malaysia)".
 Fayzen and Akeyron declare to leave the band because their own reason in the late of 2009.From that time Black Doom invite Gaban Gargle and Yow from Dark Abyss 's band to join Riwayat as a vocalis n gitaris.In 2012, BlackDoom had introduced by Popo to a old timer black metaller, Mr Aswadi.He is invited to fill the scream bloody gore vocalis for RIWAYAT.A new comer ,Jais also join us to fill the line as a guitaris.
 
RIWAYAT will continue the metal journey in extreme Black metal as long as Black Doom Sri Mayang Kala is still around and his drumming become more aggressive in Riwayat.Riwayat like international bands Behemoth,Vader,Decapitated,Cannibal Corpse,Dimmu Borgir,Hate and Thy Mighty Morbid Angel.Locally the most prefered now is Ethamnias(Kuantan) & Crown Ov Horn(Sabah)
 Now thy only tree pieces of us will arise from thy name of Riwayat and Black Doom didnt care about that again because Riwayat just wanna to release Lp or album maybe...that is our dream..hopefully it will become true.Riwayat will be more agreesive in extreme death metal song they had create for their ep's.
