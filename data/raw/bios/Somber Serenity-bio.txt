Munich Doom band SOMBER SERENITY began life as a quartet incorporating guitarists Andy Meyer and Stefan Botz with Heinz Stumpf on bass and drummer Robert Mutzbauer in the Autumn of 1994. A singer by the name of Eddy was first to take up the call for a lead vocalist but his tenure would be brief. With Stumpf departing too in September of 1995 Daniel Varoß (aka Doommonger, Daniel Pharos of Worship) took on both lead vocals and bass. The following year the debut demo, 'Drowned In Sorrow', was delivered with a second set, 'Swallowed…', arriving the following year. A further new composition, 'Last Scion Of Winter', scored some valuable inclusions on various samplers but shortly after recording founder member Andy Meyer opted out.

SOMBER SERENITY introduced replacement guitarist Reiner Benthele in March of 1998 and released a split 7" single 'The Return (Timberwolf Pt. II)' in alliance with GONE SADNESS. Another new song, 'The Sufferer', surfaced on a Canadian compilation album issued by Impaler Records. In July of 1999 FUNEBRIS member Manuel Iosca became SOMBER SERENITY's new bassist as Varoß relinquished the instrument in order to concentrate on his lead vocal role. This was not fulfilled though as Benthele exited necessitating Varoß adopting guitar in his stead. This variant of the band cut the 'Promo '99' demo.

February of 2000 brought rewards as SOMBER SERENITY supported THE GATHERING and MY DYING BRIDE at the Metropolis in Munich. Although by this juncture the band had by their own admission rejected two offers of a recording deal they embarked upon self financing a debut album that year. Unfortunately 2001 started badly as the group lost the services of both Varoß and Iosca. New guitarist Christian Löbering was drafted in 2002.

Bassist Árpád Jakab left in December of 2002.
