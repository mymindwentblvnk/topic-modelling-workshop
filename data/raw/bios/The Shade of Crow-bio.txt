The Shade of Crow is a project created by the singer and multi-instrumentist Igor Goularth.

The main idea was to create an uncompromised sound, rooted on Black Metal music that bands like Barathrum, Satyricon, Carpathian Forest and Gehenna do.

However, with the beginning of the compositions, the project was also influenced by others genres and bands, like Absu, Ajattara, Khold and Vreid. Every one of these influences, mixed with the personal influences of the mainman Igor Goularth, resulted in the first form of the project, musically speaking. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Shade+of+Crow">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
