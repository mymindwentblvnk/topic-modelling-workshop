The Last Act is breathing life into the genre “Metal Rock” . This sound is a hard rock/metal combination with a molded “old-skool” sound to it. TLA is re-inventing this style of music in a new and absolutely original result.
If you like anything on the heavier side like Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, 3 Days Grace (a bit heavier than this), Megadeth (old and new), old Metallica, old (and some new) Rush, or any of these kinds of bands chances are really good you will enjoy this band. Imagine a roughed out combination of all of these with a totally new and original sound and you got the Last Act.
