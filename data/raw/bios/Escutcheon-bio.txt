Escutcheon is a melodic death metal from the eastern part of the Netherlands, and was founded in 1996. Since their sound resembles acts like (old) In Flames, Dismember and Dissection, their style is also described as "Twenteborg metal", referring to the Dutch region they originate from. Putting up an excellent live performance, their repetoire features killer songs like The Tyrant Captain and Night's Blood (Dissection cover). 

In the first few years of their existence Escutcheon released "In Tranquil Chaos" in 1997 and "Into Orbit" in 1998. In 2002 their first full-length saw the light of day: "Unexplained Deep Space Phenomenon", which was self-released.

Around 2005, after a long period of touring, things went quiet around the band and activities were put on hold. Escutcheon decided on a comeback in early 2007 and crowned this reunion by releasing their new album "Battle Order" in January 2009.
