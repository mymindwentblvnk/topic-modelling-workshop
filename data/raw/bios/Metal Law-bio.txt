BIOGRAPHY
The beginnings of Berlin's own METAL LAW date back to 1997, when Karsten Degling (vocals, guitar) started the band under the name REUDIG, that later evolved into RAPID FIRE, before settling with the current moniker that reflects the band's music best. The influences were drawn mostly from classic German metal bands such as ACCEPT, RUNNING WILD, but also from MANOWAR and English metal heroes, IRON MAIDEN and JUDAS PRIEST.

After some inevitable replacements, mainly because of Karsten's unwillingness to compromise regarding musical style, late in 2002 Michael Dobbertin (bass) joined the band, finally a partner that completely shared Karsten's musical visions. Still as REUDIG the band recorded and self-released "Hunter & Prey" CD in 2004.

Early in 2005 Ingo Creß (drums) and Thommy Parchem (guitar), two real metal rockers, joined the band, which is now settled, dedicated to pure heavy metal and aimed at success. METAL LAW (still under the old name RAPID FIRE) was a contestant of the W:O:A Metal Battle 2006 in Berlin and the undisputed favourite of the audience (but unfortunately not of the jury that favored death metal).

The band caused furor in the German metal underground in 2006, playing shows at two festivals: Protzen Open Air and Headbangers Open Air, sharing the stage with bands such as BLITZKRIEG, METAL CHURCH, ULYSSES SIREN, METAL INQUISITOR, VIRON, POWERVICE, KORPIKLAANI and many more. METAL LAW shows are always full of energy, the musicians perform very tight, confident and relaxed, which invites the audience to party and have fun. Here action is still considered essential!

In January 2007 the official debut album, "Night Of The Wolf", was released by BattleCry Records. With memorable songs, full of excellent solos, dual leads and charismatic, slightly gruff vocals, it's a must for every metalhead looking for true metal quality. The release party was sold out and more shows followed in 2007: METAL LAW opened for SABATON and THUNDERBOLT.

The band is now working on their sophomore album, that will be released by Metal On Metal Records in November, under the title "Lawbreaker". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Metal+Law">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
