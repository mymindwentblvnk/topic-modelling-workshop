"Ancient Nightmarish Death Terror Metal."

Old school death/black metal band hailing from Poland. Influenced by thousands of 80's and early 90's Death/Speed/Black/Thrash Unholy Gods, THRONEUM stands in opposition to all these happy/hippies pseudo death/black metal craps of today!
No originality, no own style, no musical progress, but only aggressive, raw and ugly Metal as it should be - that's the only goal of the band!!!
THRONEUM was born in deepest hell dungeons back in 1996.

    Current line-up:
Tomasz - The Great Executor
Marek - Termonuclear Philosopher
Maras - Necrosodomic Corpse Molestator

Tomasz has his own label called Time Before Time records.
