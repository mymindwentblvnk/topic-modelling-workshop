Lucubro, which is Roman-Latin for "to work at night" and is pronounced Loo-Coo-Bro, describe their sound as heavy metal with a heavy doom influence. Melodic guitars, intricate bass voicings and hard-hitting drums provide the perfect foundation to Krista's vocal stylings which explode with passion.

The Provost brothers, Jeff on guitar and Steve on drums, met Krista Van Guilder (former WarHorse co-founder) on vocals and guitar through a mutual friend in September of 2000. The lineup was solidified when Heath Thayer came on board as the band's new bass player in January of 2001. During the period from January to September of 2001 the band played several hi-profile shows and released a 4-song self-titled debut that was met with much praise. September of that same year saw Steve leave to pursue other activities, but the band managed to continue it's forward motion with drummer Larry Murphy until July of 2002 when drummer Chris Gervais (formerly of the band Rawhead Rex) was added to the lineup.

At that point the band started preparing to head into the studio to record the follow-up to the 2001 debut release. Tracking for the new CD began in October of 2002, but the lineup stability continued to elude the band leading up to the departure of guitarist and original founding member, Jeff Provost. The band decided to continue recording the CD as a three-piece. Tracking was completed in April of 2003. The band is currently preparing for an August release of the new 11-song offering which will see the band's focus return to a steady show schedule and other promotional efforts in and around the New England area.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lucubro">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
