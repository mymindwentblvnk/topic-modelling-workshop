The band was established in the late 2009 in Aarhus, Denmark , under the name " Raised By Pirates ." Back then it consisted of four musicians Bjørn Poulsen (vocals and guitar), Kristian Klærke (guitar and vocals) , Jakob Bjorn Hansen ( drums and vocals) and Thorleik Mortensen on bass . After the record companies began to show interest in the four , they chose to change its name to Black City when the first name was too hard to pronounce and spell more . The name was guitarist Kristian Klærkes idea and came from the Swedish band Mustaschs song of the same name .

In autumn 2009, Bjørn Poulsen wrote the single " Summertime," which received great interest in the music business. The number was an indirect cause of the Black City in December 2009 with "Magtens Korridorer" in Denmark tour , and it was also the month that the band for the first time got a contract with a record company. The American-owned company Universal Music chose to focus on the band from Aarhus, while all the band members moved to Copenhagen.
