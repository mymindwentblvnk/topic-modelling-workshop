The Junior detective series TKKG is a series of radio plays and novels created by Stefan Wolf. In all German-speaking countries they are one of the most commercially successful series of novels of their type. They call themselves TKKG, after the initials of their names: Tarzan (later renamed in Tim, because "Tarzan" is a trademark), Karl, Doughnut (in German Klößchen, in Australia called "Klumpling") and Gaby; an unofficial fifth member is Gaby's Cocker Spaniel, called Oskar. Since 1979 they continually solve all sorts of crimes, from thefts and robberies to kidnappings and terrorism.

The books were written by Rolf Kalmuczak, under his nom de plume Stefan Wolf. In June 2004 TKKG changed their publisher from Pelican to CBJ - They published volumes 07, 14, 54, 77 and 84 in January 2005 as a new edition with the CBJ brand name. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/TKKG">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
