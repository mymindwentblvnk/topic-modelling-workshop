Led by veteran axepert Stu Marshall and formed from the ashes of the ill-fated 20 Grams, Sydney's Paindivision evoke memories of the heyday of melodically-infused metal- that glorious period in the late eighties/early nineties before Cobain and Co. swept away all that was ludicrous, melodic and hirsuite... The band is everything, has everything you'd like when slipping a cd into the ol' death deck that purports to carry the flame from those days- great guitar work, soaring melodies in all the right places and vibrant vocals courtesy of Jordan Howe and a rumblingly heavy engine room, the whole bringing to mind the likes of (Grind-era) Skid Row and UK biker boys the Almighty- no bad thing in this writer's opinion. As the current trend in the back end of 2007 drifts towards celebrating rather than vilifying the efforts of bands like Stryper, Kix et al Paindivision is well placed to make hay whilst the metal sun shines. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Paindivision">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
