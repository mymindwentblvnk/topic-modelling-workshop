RYAL is NYC based duo of Jacque Ryal and Aaron Nevezie. Combining the soulfulness of Solange with the dream pop of The xx with a pinch of Neon Indian, RYAL the project is an artistic vision of music with a unique style, an emotional vision, and a glittering inclusive world view..  Inspired by the vintage electronic textures of pulsing modular synth bass lines locked to analog drum machines and keyboards, the music blends live guitar and drum kit for an experience that combines the minimalism of Eno with the energy of the club, where the venue becomes a live wire that dances with the electricity of the songs. 

RYAL released its self-titled EP in 2014 and a full-length record titled "Silver and Gold" in the fall of 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/RYAL">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
