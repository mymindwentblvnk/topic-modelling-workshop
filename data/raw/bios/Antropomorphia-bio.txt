Bio

AntropomorphiA was spawned from the bowels of necrophilia & gore back in 1990. The band was originally formed under the name 'Dethroned Empire' in 1989 by Ferry Damen [vocals/guitar] & Marco Stubbe [drums] and former member Vincent van Boxtel [guitar].

As 'Dethroned Empire' they recorded an unreleased demo in 1989, while then musically inspired by early black & thrash metal acts such as Hellhammer/Celtic Frost and Infernal Majesty. When the musical direction shifted towards Death Metal subsequently their name changed to AntropomorphiA.
Almost immediately joined by Marc van Stiphout [Bass] to complete the line -up.


The band had several releases from which the most known one is 'Necromantic Love Songs' EP from back in 1992.
In 1999 the band parts ways with guitarist Vincent van Boxtel. The remaining members briefly considered putting the band on indefinite hold, but decided to continue and address his replacement in the future. In 2001 the band was still put a hiatus due to other obligations. 
In 2009 the band got together again and consisted of singer and guitarist Ferry Damen, drummer Marco Stubbe and bassist Marc van Stiphout. In 2010 the band worked on and recorded their first album, however, the band decided not to release this album. 
In early 2011, the band held their first concert since performing at Neurotic Deathfest in 2001 . While the band was working on new songs, they released the compilation Necromantic Love Songs, which contained the EP of the same name, as well as the demo Bowel Mutilation.
In late 2011 the band recorded their debut album Evangelivm Nekromantia at Necromorbus Studiosunder the direction of Tore Stjerna. The album was released in 2012 on Metal Blade Records.
In Germany, Evangelivm Nekromantia was indexed on April 22, 2013 due to the cover artwork and the texts by the Federal Inspectorate for Media Harmful to Young People.
