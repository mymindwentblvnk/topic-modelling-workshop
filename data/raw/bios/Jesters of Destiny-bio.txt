Jesters of Destiny were a heavy metal band from Los Angeles California. They released their debut album Fun at the Funeral in 1986 on Dimension Records. The band were working on a second album, to be titled No Laughing Matter, when they were dropped by their label, Dimension Records (a subsidiary of Metal Blade). Several tracks that were to be on that album were finally released on Ektro Records' reissue of Fun at the Funeral. After being dropped, the band continued for a while before eventually dissolving. During their short-run in the mid 80s the band were known for their unusual sound, which combined heavy metal with psychedelic music and upbeat pop, and were considered to be one of the earliest "alternative" metal bands for this. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jesters+of+Destiny">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
