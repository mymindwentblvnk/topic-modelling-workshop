Big Twins (aka Twin Gambino) was born and raised in Queensbridge Projects, an area of New York rich in Hip-Hop history. After years of listening to fellow Queens natives such as the Juice Crew, Kool G Rap, Tragedy, and others, the Mobb Deep family began to make their own sound in Hip-Hop.

Originally beginning with Prodigy and Havoc, the movement pushed on with Infamous Mobb, Big Noyd and other Mobb affiliates making an impact in the game, proving that the new generation of Queensbridge rap would live up to their predecessors. Big Twins’ first features were on the Mobb Deep records but his own group was debuted when Infamous Mobb was featured on DJ Muggs’ Soul Assassins Vol.1 which led to him meeting The Alchemist. From there, the two formed a professional relationship that spawned street classics such as “Different Worlds” and “Big T.W.I.N.S”, and inspired Alchemist to executive produce the first offering from Infamous Mobb, the “Special Edition” LP. Soon, Twins would become Alchemist’s official tour partner to promote the “1st Infantry” record and would travel Europe and the US in support.

This year, after touring extensively with Alchemist and the Infamous/G-Unit family, he has built up his fan base and Big Twins is now ready to debut his first solo project filled with his trademark flow, original wit, and unmatched voice. The project features vocalists Prodigy, Evidence (of Dilated Peoples), G.O.D., Ty Nitty, V-12, Flame Killa, Hard White, and the Alchemist. The LP also features production from Havoc, Alchemist, Evidence, Sid Roams (Joey Chavez and Bravo), Jake One (G Unit), and Sebb. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Twins">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
