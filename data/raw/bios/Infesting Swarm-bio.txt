INFESTING SWARM began in 2007, with Tobias deciding to create a band that would give room to his musical ideas. The name INFESTING SWARM is chosen, and refers to facing your inner demons which haunt your mind and spirit. Soon after, an initial lineup consisting of friends and fellow musicians was formed. Out of this, a mix of death metal combined with black metal was created. After some time and some lineup changes, INFESTING SWARM recorded their first self-titled demo in 2011, with the band then consisting of Tobias on vocals/guitar, Phil on lead guitar, Nils on bass, and Janis on drums. The demo was produced completely at Tobias' home studio, and stylistically, the band created a sort of blackened death Metal. The demo was performed in its entirety at the Metalfest Open Air 2011. After expanding the boundaries for a new sound and the recruitment of Tim (who was responsible for the vocals from now on) and Jonathan (who replaced Janis on drums), the band recorded their first full-length at CKB Studios. In 2014, Dominik of Frigoris replaced Nils on bass. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Infesting+Swarm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
