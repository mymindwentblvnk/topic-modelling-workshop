Since the creation of this band it’s been about the love of stoner rock and fun. We love Kyuss, we love chilling out and we love groovin’.

After a few line up changes we've gotten together what we believe to be a strong musical force. Since acquiring a new singer, we've recorded a five track EP entitled, Stay For Tea. For the fans of fat tones, pounding drums and groovin' bass this should be pleasing to the ear.

We have been lucky in our short existence and have played on the same stages as Winnebago Deal (UK) and Nick Oliveri’s Mondo Generator (USA) and all the great local and interstate talent that Australia has to offer.

Shellfin is loud. Shellfin is rock. Shellfin is fun. We encourage you to dance along, party with us and buy our ridiculous t-shirts! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shellfin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
