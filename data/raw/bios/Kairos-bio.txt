Mixing ambient melodies, driving rhythms, and dynamic guitar harmonies, Kairos highest goal is to lead their listeners to a state of revelation. The musical chemistry of brothers  Jason Sturm  and Josh Sturm provides the foundation to the progressive rock band, while fate presents the other elements - right on time, as the name, Kairos, indicates. While their sound and stage performance is often compared to bands like  Pink Floyd  and Tool, Kairos has shared the stage with a host of national acts of similar stature: Flyleaf, Fall Out Boy, Head Automatica, Rusted Root, The Dillinger Escape Plan, and more. Winner of XM Satellite Radios Have A Nice Gig competition, Kairos also opened for Bon Jovi before a crowd of 17,000. Vans Warped Tour dates also under their belt, the group continues to achieve success without label support as an independent band. Dominic Misja
