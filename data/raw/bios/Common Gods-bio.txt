Common Gods made their first appearance on the extreme metal scene with a Maelstrom support slot on a stage that could literally barely contain them, the Banshee Labyrinth, 7th September 2012. Now they stand, poised to take and hold Glasgow (and beyond) with their intense death metal diatribes relentlessly reformed and reforged in the three years of seeking a stable lineup, their appearance at North of the Wall Festival 2013, and gigs through Central Scotland.

First formed as Helvien in Glasgow, Scotland in 2009, Common Gods currently consists of Kai Wal√∏en (vocals), Brenden Crow (guitars),  John Gunn (bass,vocals), and James Thow (drums), following the departure of founding members Ruaridh Winstanley (bass, ukelele) and Ross Hutchison (clean vocals).
