There are two bands that share the name Weathers:

1) Formed in Los Angeles, California in October 2015, Weathers is an indie and alternative rock band best known for their 2015 hit single "Happy Pills", which was the most added-to-radio song for a new artist in the 2010s. The band has since gone on to tour supporting acts such as Saint Motel, Nothing But Thieves, Dreamers, Palaye Royale, One Ok Rock, Badflower, and Echosmith.

Lead vocalist Cameron Boyer and guitarist Cameron Olsen first met in 2012 at a local Battle of the Bands in Manhattan Beach, California. They later recruited bassist Brennen Bates and drummer Cole Carson.

Weathers released their debut album, "Kids in the Night", in 2016 as a two-part EP. Boyer said of the album "It's about accepting your flaws and realizing that the so-called 'bad' things about you are actually what shape you into who you are now â€” a stronger, better person. It's asking, 'Are the bad things really bad or are they just temporarily hard?'".

Following the realease of their debut album, Weathers released numerous singles in 2019, 2020, and 2021, with "Losing Blood", "C'est la vie", "Rehab", and "Karma" featuring as songs on their second album "Pillows & Therapy", which was released on 13th August 2021.
