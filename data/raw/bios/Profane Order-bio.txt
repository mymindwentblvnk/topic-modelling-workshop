Profane Order is a war metal band from Montr√©al, Quebec.  It was formed in 2015 by Illusory (vocals, guitars), Taylor (guitars), Olwyn (bass) and Antoine Weinberg (drums).  They self-released a demo entitled Marked by Malice in 2016.  Weinberg and Olwyn left the band, but they were not replaced right away since Illusory handled bass and drums.  It is unknown when Weinberg and Olwyn left.  The next release was an EP entitled Tightened Noose of Sanctimony, also self-released.  It is unknown whether or not Weinberg or Olwyn were on this EP.

As time went by, the band was only down to Illusory and Taylor.  They released their first full-length album Slave Mortality and it was released through Sentient Ruin Laboratories in 2019.  Illusory provided vocals, guitars, bass and drums while Taylor (known as TG on the album) provided guitars.  Taylor left the band at  an unknown point in time and he was never replaced.  At some point Maussade joined as the bassist and then MA Lazure joined as the drummer.  The band currently operates as a trio consisting of Illusory (vocals, guitars), Maussade (bass) and MA Lazure (drums).  Profane Order is currently signed to Krucyator Productions. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Profane+Order">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
