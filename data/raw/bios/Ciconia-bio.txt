Ciconia - Instrumental, progressive metal hailing from Spain.

After more than 18 years playing, touring, composing and recording with several different bands, the musician Jorge Fraguas (Bass player) created the instrumental rock band, CICONIA.

Influenced by bands such as Opeth, Anathema, Long Distance Calling, Porcurpine Tree, and even a touch of stoner rock, Ciconia blend the guitar sounds of classical rock and metal throughout their tracks, creating a unique sonic experience. It is a whole different way of living and looking at music.

In November 2013, after having taken on David Manso, Javier Altonaga and Aleix Zoreda, the first studio album ‘The Moon Sessions’ was recorded, which was released early 2014 receiving great response from music enthusiasts worldwide.

The band have recently signed a worldwide deal with Metal Music Bookings & Management and are set for a promising career ahead, including the legendary producer Roy Z (Judas Priest, Ygnwie Malmsteen & more) who is set to work on their debut album shortly. Watch this space, the band is certain to be taking their music to the masses! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ciconia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
