Ex-Pedro The Lion band members TW Walsh and David Bazan take on the synths for their new indie pop project with Starflyer 59's Frank Lenz joining the fray. Absent of traditional guitar/bass instrumentation, Bazan's deep vocal tones take centre stage, equally soothing and macabre. The dystopian parables of love, loss and loyalty uplift and upset on their self-titled debut. The record utilises open room recording with digital and analogue effects.
