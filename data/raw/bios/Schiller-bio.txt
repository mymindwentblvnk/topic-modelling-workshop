Schiller is one of Germany's leading electronic artists. The multi-Gold and Platinum-awarded project has been created by  electronic musician, producer and composer Christopher von Deylen in the tradition of teutonic sound-pioneers. 

Over the last years the Echo-Award winner and Grammy-Nominee performed more than 100 sold-out concerts - highly acclaimed by the audience and media.

Schiller's albums feature many well-known German and international guest vocalists and musicians such as Colbie Caillat, Lang Lang, Sarah Brightman, Moya Brennan, Kim Sanders, Peter Heppner, Mike Oldfield, Xavier Naidoo, Mila Mar and Tarja Turunen (formerly of Nightwish).

On his live tours, Christopher von Deylen enhances his music with breathtaking visual performances. In August 2006, Schiller appeared as a special guest at the final concert of Depeche Mode's 'Playing the Angel Tour' in Athens.

Schiller is signed to OK! Good Records in the US.
