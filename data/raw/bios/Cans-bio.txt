Multiple artists are known as Cans.

1. Cans is the heavy / power metal side project of Joacim Cans,  Hammerfall's singer.  The songs tend to have a heavier sound and darker subject matter compared to HammerFall.  Touring with Cans did occur in Europe, and a statement was released through an interview that he (Joacim Cans), was very happy with the positive feedback he received regarding this side-project, and that he would make a second album in the future.  After the release of HammerFall's album "Threshold" and the corresponding tour in the second half of 2007, Joacim stated he already had "some good ideas" on a new album. In 2013 Joacim released a second solo album under his own name, this time entirely in swedish and with a pop/swedish folk song approach, seperating it from the heavy metal side project, of which Joacim hasnÂ´t mentioned since his statement in 2007.
