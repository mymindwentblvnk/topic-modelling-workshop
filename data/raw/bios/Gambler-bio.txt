Gambler is a Finnish rock-band formed in 1975 in Liminka. They played on some big music festivals at the time (such as Saapas-rock, Kuusrock), and warmed up for Kirka but split up after playing together for some years.

In 2008 J.T. Seikkala (vocals, guitar), J. Lipsanen (guitar), I. Seikkala (bass guitar) and J.K. Korhonen (drums) got together again to release a come-back album "Reality" that consists of 10 of their own songs, influenced by the biggest rock-bands from the 70's (Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, ZZ Top). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gambler">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
