Experimental noise band, formed in Boston 1978. Notorious for their early recordings which were exercises in brutal noise, such as their infamous 1985 album Knees And Bones which utilised pneumatic drills, metal percussion and cement mixers as sound sources. Subsequent albums delved into sonic and textural experimentation as the band gradually grew more sophisticated and palatable, however a number of less experimental, commercial industrial albums were released on Wax Trax! in the late 1980s. 
The group was founded by Paul Lemos, the group's only consistent member. Most of Controlled Bleeding's released recordings feature two main collaborators, Chris Moriarty and vocalist Joe Papa, who both died in the late 2000s.
Since their first full-length release in 1983, Controlled Bleeding have released over 30 albums spanning several different genres, many of which were released on notable independent labels. Their cross-genre approach combined with the out-of-print status of many of the group's releases is reminiscent of the work of other experimental and cross-genre groups of the 80s and 90s such as Coil and Swans. Nontheless, Controlled Bleeding's sound varies from album to album and at one time or another has contained elements of dub, free jazz, noise, prog rock, sacred music, dark ambient, classical and musique concr√®te.
