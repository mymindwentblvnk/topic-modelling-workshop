David Galas (born 30 September 1970 in Tempe, AZ, United States) is an American musician. Best known for his work with the ethereal wave pioneer band Lycia, David has been composing and producing darkwave and atmospheric rock for over 20 years.

He began producing his first music as early as 1984 with keyboards and multiple tape recorders. In the late '80s he teamed up with several other musicians and worked under various projects. During the early 1990s David began experimenting with ambient and darkwave music, and in 1994 he became a member of Lycia, performing on the albums "The Burning Circle and Then Dust", "Cold" and "Empty Spaces". He was also part of the duo Bleak along with Mike VanPortfleet. 

In 2000 David started writing material for his first solo album. After five years he finally finished his debut album, "The Cataclysm". It was released on Vendlus Records in 2006 and received many positive reviews. Since then, David has released three more solo albums: "The Happiest Days of My Life" (2009), "The Ghosts of California" (2011) and "A Long Hard Road To Nowhere" (2018).
