Some guys from Sao Jose dos Campos (close to Sao Paulo) had enough from their bands ATROZ; ETHER and METAFEL, and founded in 1985 ATTOMICA, including the brothers Andre (b) and Pyda Rod (g). The first songs had portuguese lyrics. Later they managed to participate on the first "Rock Brigade" compilation. Their first album is really good Speed Metal, which was a rare style in Brazil, but they had a typical "snotty" singer. In 1988 they had several changes of the singer, till Andre started to sing himself. On the second album they show their love of typical "Bay Area Thrash", and they distinguished themselves from the typical, more extreme Thrash in the country. Before the third album they had some major changes in the band, brother Pyda leaves and two new guitar players (including Joao Marcio von MEGATON), and a singer join the band. They became faster and played really good, ultra fast Thrash Metal. The band split up in 1994, and Brazil had one hopeful Metal band less! The members did not play in any band afterwards. Only in the year 2000, 3 of the guys came together again in an AC/DC cover band! In 2002 one of the old singers joined them too, and they started again with ATTOMICA! But in the band name they made soon a small change into ATOMICA! The old Cogumelo label re released first the "Disturbing the noise" album on CD (with 2 live bonus tracks). The band themselves recorded first a live album.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Attomica">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
