Having released two records with Elikat .. "Caught in Love" (1989) and "Electrikat" (1991) - Luis Massot (singer) become a member of Mr. Cheese in London. There, the idea of fusing together rock and Spanish own musical roots led to the further foundation of Ziryab . A few months latter, after many concerts, the band signs on with Avispa Records replacing the name by TAIFA and releasing" Más allá del Sur" (1999).. produced by Medina Azahara singer, Manuel Martínez- from which they self-produce" Guitarra- Espejo de mi alma" video clip, being warmly received by expertise media and general public. From this moment on, the band is giving concerts in Mallorca and the rest of Spain showing their strong point is on stage.As time goes by, TAIFA style evolves getting a harder, more flamenco and more electronic sound -due essentially to the introduction of samples- and the band turns into a trio: Luís Massot (vocals, bass and samples), Martí Riera ( guitar) and Antonio Medina (drums). Currently, afther their concert in the AL-LAMA en OUED LAOU festival( Tetouan-Marrocco), they are recording their second LP that will demonstrate their originality and potential by being the only band joining together progressive metal and flamenco.
