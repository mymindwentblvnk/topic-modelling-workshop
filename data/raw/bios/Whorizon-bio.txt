Whorizon is a band formed by Kyle Goetzke in 2005. After creating two demo tapes for forthcoming albums, "Let the Sky Fall Away into the Night" in 2005 and "A Pretty Face Is No Longer a Requirement to Be Beautiful" in 2006, fiancee Alexandra (she's, like, a thousand times cooler than he is, by the way) joined the band. Look for demos in the future. Whorizon plays indie rock, progressive rock, folk, metal, and good music in general.
