E-X-E was a thrash metal band from New York City, that was formed in 1984. They released two albums, Stricken by Might in 1987 and "Sicker Than I Thought" in 1990. The albums developed a small cult following, but never received much attention and eventually the band split up. Bassist R.H. Boeckel later helped found industrial metal band Bile in 1992, adopting the stage-name R.H. Bear, whom he performed with until 2010. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/E-X-E">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
