Fantasy Power Metal from Berlin / Germany

Logar's Diary is a six-piece. All the band's music is dealing with the adventures of the magician Logar in the Earthdawn universe (Earthdawn is a famous role-playing-game). Logar wrote down his quests and found some bards who wrote the music for his lyrics.

So LogarÂ´s Diary is a 100% concept band and every single album is a story on its own.
 
The idea of the band was born in spring 1998. After the musicians had finished the songwriting in 1999 they recorded the first chapter of the story, until winter 2000 at Goblins & Gnomes studio. "Book I" was released as a demo-CD in April 2001, completely financed by the band itself. The reactions were pretty good and Logar had the opportunity to choose between several record-deal offerings. Finally, they signed at Metal Fortress Entertainment (MFE) where the second CD was released. 

The recording of the CD- "Book 2: Parlainth - The Forgotten City" - was finished in 2004, but due to business problems and the replacement of the drummer the CD release was delayed several times. 

At the end of 2006 the first pressing of "Book II" (digipack) was sold out, but you can take part at the whole story again, cause "Book II" is available again as jewelcase. You can order it directly at Logar's Diary: www.logar.org 

The journey continues... The band is starting to work on the concept of "Book III" these weeks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Logar%27s+Diary">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
