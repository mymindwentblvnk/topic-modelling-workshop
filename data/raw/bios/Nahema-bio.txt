Nahema is a French rock band with many influences. It's a crew of five young men whose hearts are burning for music.

Four of them are seeable onstage, Zeb: Drums, Pac: Guitar and vocals, Martin: Bass, and Had: Guitar.

Martin and Pac have met each other at school, Had became a friend in highschool,and the three guys have finally met Zeb while recording an album for another artist in studio in Paris.

A vibe they have never felt before made them realise they have just formed Nahema.
