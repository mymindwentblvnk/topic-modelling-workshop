p.b.k. is the most often used pseudonym for producers Niko Brenscheid & Patrick Vollmari from Paderborn / Germany.  
They both met back in 1992, inspired by early drum and bass records, and it was at this time, they decided to produce music of their own.
Germany´s most popular drum and bass DJ, Bassface Sascha, picked up a DAT and signed two of their tracks to his label “Smokin´Drum Recordings” in 1994 and so their first release came out a year later on that imprint.

p.b.k. spent many hours in the studio writing more ambient and mellow drum and bass tracks, but the environment wasn`t yet right for releasing this sort of material in their own country.
Nowadays their music is influenced by '70's soul-jazz and funk. Their tunes create a deep atmosphere with groovy basslines, rolling drums, lush pads, spaced out sounds and sometimes, guitar support from Moalin´s Christian Kleinhenrich.

p.b.k. will keep on progressing with the musical side of drum and bass but also work on their downtempo project “Silver Lounge” in the future.
In 2004 they started their own label called "camino blue recordings" and release music on vinyl, cd and in digital from artists such as future engineers, pariah, electrosoul system, pete rann, greenfly or mark j to mention but a few.
p.b.k. also dj; they played sets in clubs all over europe including venues in France, Germany, Russia, Holland, Ukraine or Poland amongst others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/P.B.K.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
