Lord Belial is a Swedish black metal group, formed in winter of 1992. They released their debut album Kiss The Goat in 1995; placing them among the pioneers of Swedish black metal. Their music could be described as melodic black metal, but they are incorporating swedish death metal influences. Lord Belial is one of a few swedish black metal bands who have stood against the winds of change since the early 90's. Their succesful releases have proved their position as one of the leaders in their genre. In January 2009, they stopped all their activities. The main reason for this is the hearing problem (tinnitus) that has grown into a quite big problem for their drummer Micke Backelin the last years. The other members in the band were not forced to put an end to the band but instead they mutually agreed that finding another drummer was not a solution for the future.  Anyhow, if Mickeâ€™s hearing will be at least a little bit recovered, the band said that they would be glad to continue where they ended.

In July 2010 they announced that Lord Belial had been resurrected with the original line up.  They disbanded again in 2015 and then they came back in 2020.

Line up:
Dark / Thomas Backelin (vocals/guitar)
Bloodlord / Anders Backelin (bass)
