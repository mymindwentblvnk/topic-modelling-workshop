1) Dead Ringer are a band from Bergen County, NJ that openly admits to missing the '90s. And when they say that, they're referring not to overwrought, flannel-laden grunge, boy bands or even the third wave of ska, but to the days of fast, catchy, melodic skatepunk. Back when labels still routinely released compilations on CD and had mailorder catalogs. Those days.

Dead Ringer reminds us all that the sound many of us grew out of a long time ago--some refer to it as the "EpiFat" sound--may still have some breathing room within the scope of our scene. Listen/download the demo at http://www.deadringer.bandcamp.com/
