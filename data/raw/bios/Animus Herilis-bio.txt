Animus Herilis was a black metal band from Le Creusot, Burgundy, France formed in 1993. According to their website, the band was born from "a strong aversion to any form of religion...The thought should be independent and not dictated by a dogma."
The band released the first demo in 2001 and the first full-length album, Recipere Ferum in 2005.

Animus Herilis participated at the compilation "Unis Contre Les Religions du Desert" by EuropArt.

In July 2008, the band has split up and Forbeus and Erik have since then reactivated their previous band called Sovereign. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Animus+Herilis">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
