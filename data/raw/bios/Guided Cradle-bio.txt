Guided Cradle started as a cover band called Anti-Climax in spring 2004 doing crust punk and thrash metal covers. A year later they added Austin Lucas on the 2nd guitar and changed their name to Guided Cradle. A 'Guided Cradle" was an instrument of torture Christians used on unbelievers. With the new guitarist and original songs, they recorded their debut LP.

They are now based in Portland, OR, after living in Prague, Czech Republic.
