«Cosmic dust taking you wherever you like. That's creativity. That's freedom. [...] There's a great quality of soul about this. What's even more alluring is, you know not why.» (StraightNoChaser Magazine, 2005).

Dimlite is the main alias of musician/producer Dimitri Grimm, originally from a tiny village somewhere in Switzerland.

After releasing a first EP («A/DD», 2003) and two albums («Runbox Weathers», 2005 & «This Is Embracing», 2006) on the Berlin-based label Sonar Kollektiv and additional records under other outlets The Slapped Eyeballers (a pop-rock-ish duo w/ Balt Mirczok) or Misel Quitno (a more tripped out lo-fi moniker, dedicated to 1/4-inch tape and an imaginary 60's-sound), Dimlite is currently playing shows throughout Europe and simultaneously working on his forthcoming records on Egon's recordlabel Now Again.
