Presidio is Julian Roper, a young guy from Adelaide, South Australia, who makes an eclectic and truly diverse mix of unique Electronica, Dance and Alternative music that tends to evolve with each release.

Presidio was created to vent music that just didn't (and still doesn't) confine to any particular genre. The self-taught sound production gives Presidio an individual and vivid sound, as Roper's soundscapes echo a disconnection to the world. Letting the world around him freely shape his music it will probably be weird, but it will definitely be unique and it will never be the same.
