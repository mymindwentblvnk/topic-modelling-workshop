Psychogenesist arose to life after the break up of the band Bone Crushing Annihilation in 2007. Hailing from Orange County NY these epic musicians aim to get metal back on top, where it belongs! Shortly after their formation a 4 song demo was recorded, which gained them world-wide attention. Mind altering lyrics are complemented by earth-shattering guitar riffs and inhuman drumming, while emotional solos are used at dramatic times!

Many shows followed this release, including two with Cryptopsy, and another with Vital Remains. 

These dudes are currently hard at work finishing the unimaginable album that will not disappoint extreme metal fans world wide! Keep a lookout for a 2011 release! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Psychogenesist">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
