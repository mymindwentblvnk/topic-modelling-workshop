1) Birmingham, Alabama has a very dark history…
From the horrors of the Civil Rights movement to Eric Rudolph’s nefarious abortion clinic bombing to the haunted legends of Sloss Furnaces. It is, perhaps, this inauspicious influence that has lent itself to the hauntingly desperate music of the progressive art rock musings of Birmingham, Alabama four piece, apsis.

Since Halloween of 2005 apsis have crafted their sonic mix of sludge, post rock, and alternative metal into the brooding, progressive soundscapes that can currently be heard on their newest release “The Iliac Crest”.

Intricate while retaining a minimalist approach, the band writes songs about loss, confusion and sad endings that are somehow illuminated by the faint glimmer of hope and faith. Often overlooked because of their staunch refusal to follow cookie cutter trends of so many other acts, the band infuses their songs with honesty and emotion that soon wins over even the most critical listener.
