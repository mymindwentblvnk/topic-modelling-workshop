Old school, new school, no school!?!
Thrash-Metal as itÂ´s best! Fast, aggressive & melodious could be the best short description of JESUS CHRYSLER SUPERSKUNKs sound! The band, established in 2000 with former DESTRUCTION, NECRONOMICON and HATE SQUAD members, knows when to press the gas pedal, where to place a soli or to find an excellent symbiosis of speed riffing and hard, but melodic vocal lines! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jesus+Chrysler+Superskunk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
