Founded in 2002 by Simone Bosi and Tony De Marco; between 2002 and 2012 two demos have been written by the two and recorded. After their first full-length, Wrath Among the Dead (2012), founding member Boni left the band; five years later Tramortiria broke the contract with SG Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tramortiria">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
