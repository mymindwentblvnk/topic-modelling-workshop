Ryan Alvarado and James Fraser forged Gemanon mid 2011. Their initial goal was to find individuals both talented and ambitious to complete their lineup. Deciding to let their newly composed music find the right musicians rather than vice versa, Paul Anderson and Jesus Sahagun soon joined the ranks of Gemanon. 

With a business goal set, the four musicians got to work on the music aspect of their newfound destiny. Though the chemistry was solid and the music infinitely powerful, they felt an emptiness in their live sound. Stephen Pocus, a classically trained jazz pianist was called upon to fill the void. The now final product seeks solace in spreading their music around the globe under the fabled name: Gemanon. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gemanon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
