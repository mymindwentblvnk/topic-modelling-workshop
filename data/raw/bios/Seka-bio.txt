There’s more than 1 band with the name ‘Seka’ 

1- Seka is punk rock band formed in 1995, influenced by folk, .reggae and ska from  Turrialba, Costa Rica . Band Members: Alejandro Imbach (Bass), El Kako (Guitar), Esteban Rodriguez (Vocals & guitar), Vílmer Lopez (Guitar), Moritz (Drums) and Miguel Imbach (Acordion). They're signed under La Golondrina Records.

2- Seka was a Boston, Massachusetts thrash metal band that formed in 1988.  In 1991 Seka won the city's biggest amateur band competition, the “WBCN Rock and Roll Rumble”.  This perennial radio station event most likely led to Boston-based Taang Records issuing the band's debut album, "Love Shim".  Shortly thereafter, the porn actress named "Seka" took legal action against the band, which resulted in the band changing their name to STRIPMIND in 1992. Stripmind had culled drummer Sully Erna, later of Godsmack fame, from fellow local metal band, Meliah Rage during the post-Seka period.  Stripmind released a major label album, “What’s In Your Mouth”, on Sire/Reprise in 1993.  There would be other subsequent line-up changes in the band during the next few years and their music, as exemplified in a later musical incarnation named “Roadsaw”, shifted towards a more modern style of metal. The Seka/Stripmind band eventually broke up in 1994. 

The original Seka lineup:
Stu Shoaps - Vocals, Guitar 
Tim Catz - Bass 
Billy O'Malley - Guitar 
Tim Jordan - Drums
