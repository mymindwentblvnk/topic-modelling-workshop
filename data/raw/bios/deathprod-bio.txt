Deathprod is a musical pseudonym used sometimes by Helge Sten from RÃ¸ros, Norway for his ambient-influenced music. On recordings, he is usually credited with "Audio Virus," a catchall term for "homemade electronics, old tape echo machines, ring modulators, filters, theremins, samplers and lots of electronic stuff."

Sten began creating music under this name starting in 1991, culminating with a box set of most of his recorded work being released in 2004. Simply titled Deathprod, the collection contains three albums along with a bonus disc of previously unreleased, rare, and deleted tracks.

In 2004, he released his fourth and final album, Morals and Dogma. He has also worked with Biosphere on an Arne Nordheim tribute album called Nordheim Transformed. He is a member of Supersilent and works as a producer on many releases on the Norwegian label Rune Grammofon. He has also produced Motorpsycho.

Sten also did the mixing of the album "PB" by the Norwegian artist Per Bergersen. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deathprod">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
