Established in October 2008 when Aulia Fadil texted three of his friends: Krisnu Maruti, Dustin Wolff and Andriyanto Prabowo to make a group of heavy metal. Describe their music as primal epic war with heaviest distorted sound, banging against low mentality.
At that time their band was known as "Turbin", then in 2009 they changed their name became BELAKANGKA. This name was coined by Krisnu Maruti after inspired by the colossal figures in the era of the Majapahit kingdom.
They decided to create their own music through conceptualize any restless individual improvisation and imagination, then show 'em at college's event, high school's event and many gigs.
