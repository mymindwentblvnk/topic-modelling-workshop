There is more than one artist known as Assimilation.

1) Assimilation is the attempt to reconcile multiple spheres of musical interest in one entity. Starting with the ambience of Cylon and William Basinski, framed by the harsh noise of Koufar, styled with the post-industrial heavy electronics of Alberich, and presented live in the spirit of sound artists such as Peter Van Riper. A solo project from Indiana, Assimilation uses synthesizers, guitars, loopers, samplers, field recordings, found "instruments" such as sheet metal and leaves, copious amounts of reverb and live mixing to create his sounds on stage.

2) ASSIMILATION is an alias of Family Farce used in the StepMania project Hopscotch Mix. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Assimilation">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
