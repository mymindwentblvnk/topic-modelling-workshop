Michael Collins started his musical career under the name Run DMT, making lo-fi psych-pop with a chillwave feel. After a lawsuit and a slight change of focus, he reappeared as Salvia Plath, releasing the nicely done psych-folk album The Bardo Story in 2013. One (more) name change and musical shift later, Collins came back with Drugdealer, a project with a more laid-back, early-'70s singer/songwriter vibe. Stripped of much of the densely layered, heavily psychedelic approach he'd used in the past, Collins is more content to focus on the songs as much as the sound this time around. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Drugdealer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
