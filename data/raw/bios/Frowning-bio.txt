Frowning was founded in January 2011, impressed by Funeral Doom bands like Pantheist and Evoken Val wrote the first song: Day In Black. Then a few other songs came (Death Song, The Vicious Circle). But they all just were uploads on youtube. In Autumn 2013 Frowning decided to make a Split-EP with the british Doomband "Aphonic Threnody". The Split came out in April 2014 and is called "Aphonic Threnody VS. Frowning Of Graves, of Worms and Epitapths". The CD was released under the russian label GSP-music. After that EP the californian label Wretched Records asked for a contract - Frowning signed. The debutalbum "Funeral Impressions" was released in 25th Oct 2014 under Wretched Records.
