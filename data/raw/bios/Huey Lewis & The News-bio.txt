Huey Lewis & the News is an Academy Award-nominated American rock band based in San Francisco, California. They had a run of hit singles during the 1980s and early 1990s, scoring a total of 19 top-ten singles across the US Billboard Hot 100, Adult Contemporary and Mainstream Rock charts. Their greatest success was with their number-one album, 'Sports'. Their worldwide fame expanded when their recording of "The Power of Love" was featured as a key track in the 1985 movie "Back to the Future" (in which Huey Lewis made a cameo appearance). The song became a number-one hit, and it was nominated for an Academy Award.

From a first single in 1979, the group successfully combined a pop rock and power pop (and sometimes, a blues rock) influenced backing with harmony side-vocals and Lewis' strident voice, and the band had numerous hit songs during the 1980s and early 1990s. These include "The Power of Love" and "Back in Time" (both of which were featured in the film "Back to the Future"), "I Want a New Drug", "Doin' It All (For My Baby)", "Do You Believe in Love?" "Hip to Be Square", "Stuck With You", and "Jacob's Ladder". Huey Lewis shared three Grammy awards, an American Music Award, and a People's Choice Award along with several artists for his role singing the 1985 charity song "We Are the World" as well.
