The little things in life are supposed to please us humans...why then redefine a whole new world and tell everyone about it? The interested listener/reader should be spared of phrases like "we reinvented the wheel", instead of that, feel invited to experience the colourful sound of CASKETNAIL.
The bastard of Metal and Hardcore is being lived and the thin line between brutality and melodic virtuosity is being well balanced. The icing on the cake is a sheer wide range of shouts, screams, growls and catchy tunes. 2005 began with a restructuring period through line-up changes which resulted in a stronger and even more powerful line-up. Besides numerous gigs CASKETNAIL also gained experience by playing support-shows for Bands like DEVILDRIVER, DISENGAGE, MACHINEMADE GOD, MAROON, SUNRISE, THE AGONY SCENE and UNDYING. The criticism was always good...sometimes almost frightening... 
Instead of resting on their earned laurels the five piece band is using the support from 2005 for a prosperous year 2006 and to show that Darmstadt has more to offer than misery and students...
