Gyibaaw is a black metal/death metal band that was formed in Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, in 2006. Their songs reflect the culture of northern British Columbian First Nations, in both their lyrical and musical content. Their first full length, "Ancestral War Hymns", came out June 24th 2009, and 2010 saw the release of a split with Mitochondrion entitled "Rituals of Transcendence/Liimk Halaayt", on which Gyibaaw contributes multiple original songs as well as a cover of Ukrainian black metal band Drudkh. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gyibaaw">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
