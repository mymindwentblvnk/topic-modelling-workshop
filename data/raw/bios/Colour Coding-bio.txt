Together, Chris Holland and Tim Commandeur make Colour Coding. 
They cut their musical teeth in Gold Coast pop band Operator Please, 
and now, these two cousins have embarked on their own musical
venture.

With both now living in Sydney, they were able to write 
consistently throughout the back half of 2011. 

Their self produced debut EP entitled 'Proof' was recorded at the Hurley 
studios in September and they have released the first of the 5 tracks, 'Perfect". 

They are currently putting together a live show and their EP is expected early 2012. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Colour+Coding">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
