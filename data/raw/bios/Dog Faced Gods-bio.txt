Formed in 1997 by ex Ebony Tears members Johnny Wranning and Conny Jonsson, the idea was to combine extreme metal and hardcore with odd meter grooves. At the end of 1997 they found a drummer in Ricky Evensand, and a bassist in Peter Tuthill and started writing and rehearsing.

In May 1998 they entered Studio Underground to record their debut cd "Random Chaos Theory In Action" for GNW Records. An album that got great reviews all over the world and massive airplay on Swedish radio, but due to distribution problems nothing really happened and the band and the record company went separate ways. 

In March 1999 Peter Tuthill left the band, and Dog Faced Gods welcomed a new bassplayer aboard, Peter Kahm, and recorded a demo. A demo that landed a new record deal, but only one week prior to the recording of the follow-up album, the company went bankrupt! The band continued to write music and rehearse. 

After a while the guys decided to put the band on hold. Ricky went away to play with a couple of other bands, such as Chimaira and Soilwork. Conny was involved in various projects.

In April 2005 Conny Jonsson, Ricky Evensand and Peter Tuthill decided to once again join forces and the reforming of Dog Faced Gods was a fact!

More determined than ever Dog Faced Gods have started writing new material for an upcoming follow-up to the critically praised debut album "Random Chaos Theory In Action"!
