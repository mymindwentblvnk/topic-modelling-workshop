Thomas Rowland, born in Barnstable, Massachusetts on March 18, 1993. He is professionally known as Rowlan, and is an American rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer. He initially gained recognition through his remix of “Nikes On My Feet” by Mac Miller. The song reached over 500 thousand streams total with over 100 thousand views on the YouTube video.

He since has put out over 100 songs in single and EP format, much of which has helped him gradually grow his following with his fans. At the age of 22, he moved to LA to pursue his music career, with hopes to build connections, and meet creatives on a similar path.

Later that year he met his producer/engineer Cesar Moreno, and got connected with Mike Wingless to produce “Hold It Down”, his first song to get over a million streams on Spotify. He went on to make tracks such as “Why”, “Champ”, and “Stories”, which all got over a million streams on Spotify.

In 2017 internet sensation Gary Vaynerchuk, aka GaryVee, found interest in Rowlan and had a sit down with him. This led to Rowlan making Gary’s theme song “Born Hustler”, the Hustler’s anthem.

As of July 2021, Rowlan has become fully independent. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rowlan">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
