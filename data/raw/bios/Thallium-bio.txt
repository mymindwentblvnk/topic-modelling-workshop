1- Thallium is a one-man black metal band from São Paulo, Brazil. Formed in 1995 Thallium released 1 demo "Gèvaudan", 1 full-lenght album "A Howling From a Thousand Years" and a split album with S.A.R. and Evil (Both black metal from Brazil). Thallium also participated on a Graveland tribute cd with a cover of the song "Witches' Holocaust".

2- Thallium is a french singing jazz/rock that seems to have released one 4-tracks album "Prémices".

3- Thallium (Melodic Death Metal from Germany) has been brought to life by Florian in spring 2005 in Oldenburg. 
After some weeks of searching for musicians Stefan (bass), Marcel (lead guitar) and Ronny (rhythm guitar) joined the band. Later Michael (vocals) joined in, too. 
In the beginning Thallium practiced in the cellar of Florians flat. This room had to be abandoned because the band was to loud. 
In Oldenburg the finding of a new practice area turned out to be very dificult. Past one month in the beginning of the year 2006, outside of the city, the band finaly found a new practice area. 
After some changes in line up and members, Marcel left the band. At that time Michael changed from vocals to the lead guitar and Dario took over the singing. Now the actual songwriting really started. 
Eventually Thallium went to Blexen in the county Wesermarsch in middle of december 2006 to record a demo cd, which was handed out to the band completely mixed in january 2007. (Which is streamable here: http://www.last.fm/music/Thallium+%28Melodic+Death+-+Metal+aus+Oldenburg%29/Demo+2007)
In the beginning of January 2007 one more change of members was enforced. Stefan (bass) left the band. 
The place of the bass player was taken over by Simon. 
Now a stable lineup for new Songs and live acts is fixed. Thallium mix up their own style with a sonority reminding of a typical scandinavian sound. This gives a very unique touch to the rocking, modern melodic-death-metal sound from Germany. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thallium">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
