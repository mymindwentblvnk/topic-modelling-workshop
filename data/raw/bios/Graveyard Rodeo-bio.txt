The band existed from 1980-1993 where they split up. After the initial break up, in 1994 Gary Gennaro and Tommy Scanlan reassembled the band with a new lineup to fulfill their recording contract with Century Media. They only had a month to finish the album, as a result many of the songs that appeared on "On The Verge" were originally recorded with the early lineup. Lyrics for those songs were rewritten by Mark Brignac though musically they were the same. In 1997, Gary and Tommy had decided that it no longer felt like GYR and disbanded.

Attempts were made at a reunion in 2004. Nothing came of it. As of May 2007 Graveyard Rodeo has reformed and are set to play Raise The Dead II and Glenn Rambo (former vocalist of Drip, Soilent Green and Nuclear Crucifixion) Memorial Festival later this year in New Orleans. According to Wayne "Doobie" Fabra, a possible title for their upcoming full length is: A Hideous Perfection of Grindhouse Morbidity.

Original guitarist Lee Fucich left the band to become a pathologist.
Guitarist Brad Christiana is only scheduled to play at Raise The Dead II. It remains to be seen whether he will rejoin fulltime. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Graveyard+Rodeo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
