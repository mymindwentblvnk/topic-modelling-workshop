Faithxtractor is a death metal band from Cincinnati, Ohio (in the U.S.A.) that formed in 2005 by brothers Ash and Marquis Thomas. Faithxtractor is comprised of Ash Thomas (Estuary, Crucified Mortals, Surgikill, Shed the Skin, Machinations of Fate) on guitars, drums, vocals, bass; Marquis Thomas (Vladimirs, Thorns of the Carrion) on guitars and backing vocals; Zdenka Prado (Estuary, Forty Days Longing, Surgikill, Garden of Shadows) on bass; and Cody Knarr (Unkured) on guitars.
Ash Thomas also has quite possibly the best collection of Iron Maiden posters in the continental United States. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Faithxtractor">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
