With three months of testings in the studio , the Tombstone demo tape was released . Obel though had to leave the band because of duties . His place was taken by Nick Andreadakis . So here they are , the late days of February '98 , and the Crystal Age demo is released.Nick's personal problems force him to leave the band in April and Obel , free from the duties that kept him away for that period , returned to take his old place to arrive at the third release, Clonosis promo CD. Up to now they have one more studio recording "U-238".  Obel left the band and George Droulias took over his place. The First official album named "Birth Of The Nuclear Age" was released after an agreement with Sleaszyrider Records .
