5) Hail is a US noise black metal band. Started out as a solo performance project by Carl Annala, which blossomed into a musical performance troupe. In 1998, Set Sothis (L'Acephale) joined for a new incarnation in which black metal was matched with militaristic neo-folk and Neurosis-style multi-percussion doom along with various sound sources as background sounds. Markus Wolff was recruited and one live show was performed at the celebration for the opening of a local branch of the OTO. Crimson Madrigal was the result of this time period.

Tim Call was recruited as a live drummer and a change in the sound developed, which was later abandoned in 2001. In the Winter of 2006, the project was resurrected, first as a recording project and later a live ensemble for a series of gigs with Fauna. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hail">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
