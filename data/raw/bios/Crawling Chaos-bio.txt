There are 3 bands called Crawling Chaos:

(1) Crawling Chaos is a post-punk band from the UK
(2) Crawling Chaos is a death metal / grindcore band from Italy
(3) The Crawling Chaos is an experimental sludge band from Russia

(1) The Crawling Chaos started in Ashington, Northumberland in the late 1970s in the UK by two young men, soon to be Doomage Khult and Strangely Perfect who met at the local school, sharing an interest in astronomy, music, gloomy science and horror fantasy novels and science itself. Skills in music and electronics coupled with the punk explosion in 1976 led them commit to the creation of a proper band together. Early '78 saw them setting up studio equipment and developing techniques, writing compositions but without a clear idea of personnel requirements. A reasonably clear idea of styles and attitudes was in place. At this time, other school acquaintances were keen but not really good enough to be partners. The name was chosen around then because it sounded good, it was a partial homage to H.P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos heâ€™d created.

(2) Crawling Chaos is a Death Metal band born in the late 2005 in Rimini, Italy. In January 2009, Crawling Chaos released its first demotape called "Goatsuckers", a completely homemade 20 minutes EP. In December 2012, finally recorded its first full-length, 
"Repellent Gastronomy".

(3) The Crawling Chaos was founded in Moscow, Russia in 2013. Their style is an experimental blend of sludge and black metal. They have no guitar player (using two basses instead), and the saxophone adds an eerie contrast to the sludgy riffs. The band has released two full-length albums, in 2015 and 2016. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Crawling+Chaos">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
