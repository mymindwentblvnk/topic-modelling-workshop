Thrash metal from United Kingdom, Lyrical themes; Death, Rituals, Thrash... An obscure British band, Energetic Krusher released one album in 1989 and was never heard from again. Musically they played rough thrash, akin to fellow Brits such as Hellbastard or perhaps Cerebral Fix. The lineup information in particular is hard to come by, with bassist Danny McCormack (later seen in the hard rock band The Wildhearts) the only known entity.

After Energetic Krusher broke up, some members combined with members of Hellbastard to form Hellkrusher. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Energetic+Krusher">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
