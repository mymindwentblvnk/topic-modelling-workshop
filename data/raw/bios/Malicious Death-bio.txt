MALICIOUS DEATH is a thrash metal band from Helsinki, Finland. After their somewhat promising debut (mini-)album called DEVILIZATION which was self-released through the band's own label REBELLION RECORDS in 2003 as a limited edition of 300 copies only, the guys kept on rehearsing new stuff, sometimes more, and sometimes less actively. As a result of those rehearsal sessions was the 2-song-promo CD called "Possessed/Slaughter". Line up GG (Greger Gr√∂nholm) - Vocals, Obadio - Guitars, Bilibaldus - Bass,Jerker - Drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Malicious+Death">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
