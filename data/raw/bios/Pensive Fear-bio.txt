Back in 1996, I had a thought of recording a heavier cd at the time. at 1st it was titled: Scarifide which is my home studio, by the way. But anyway, I recorded the music and wrote the songs for the cd. But I was not happy with my vocals since I'm a guitarist "NOT" a singer. I ask a good friend Joel Stiles to sing on the cd. After a few sessions the cd was semi-complete, But instead of calling it ...the studio's name it should be called something close with the same kinda meaning? That's where Pensive Fear came from? From being scary to being very scary. But yet the cd didnt have a name yet, until we recorded the last song titled: FORBIDDEN ENRTY. That was it, enough said, the song turned out great minus the sound quality, since I just started recording on the computer and had to learn as I go. And everyone said I could never do it? Boy, they were wrong. And like I said, back then I didn't know to save all your work after you get a good track. So with that said, you can kinda figure I lost the masters. OOPS, but I did the best I could to retry and put the cd out for sale anyway. That was the start of PENSIVE FEAR. Plus I had help from friends of mine on different songs Jason Shoenfelt, Brad Kensinger, Dan Way, Dave Ehredt, Justin Filer, Mark Davis. But all didn't make it on the cd but still very thankful for there help. And everyone that helped my along the way. I'm still very thankful for all the support and kindness I got and still receive.... Thank-You All ! <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Pensive+Fear">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
