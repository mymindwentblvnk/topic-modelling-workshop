Blizzard at Sea is a three-piece metal band that plays a dynamic blend of sludge, progressive, and post-metal. Their songwriting is defined by complex structures and textures that forgo traditional conceptions of genre. Driven by sprawling guitar riffs and frenzied drumming, Blizzard at Sea's heavy sound is shaped not by the imaginary rules of the music scene, but by what feels right.

Formed in early 2010 and driven by a passion for music, Blizzard at Sea has constantly pushed themselves to share their sound with as many people as possible. In addition to playing numerous shows around the Midwest, Blizzard at Sea put together a demo, recorded their debut EP, Invariance, and released a full-album music video to accompany and compliment the musical and lyrical themes running through the album.

Currently, the band is in the writing process for their next release.

The band's sound begins with a massive wall of fuzzy bass, serving as the glue that holds together the eclectic drumming and intelligent guitar work. Commanding vocals complete the powerful orchestration and serve as thought-out accents rather than the focus of the songs. Apparent in their songwriting, artwork, and even name, Blizzard at Sea is about the communication of ideas, concepts, and other worlds.
