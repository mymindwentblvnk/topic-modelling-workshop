Faal was founded in Breda, The Netherlands in 2005 by Alex (guitar), Pascal (guitar) and Ward (drums). The band released Abhorrence-Salvation in 2008. After a long period of searching for the right band members, eventually the band has formed a steady line-up with Yara (synths), Harrie (bass) and William (vocals) in 2010. 

The band's name, "Faal", can be translated as "failure", as in 'failing in this life', feeling powerless and not being able to succeed or do something about it. Their songs can be described as stories, and each story exists out of different ways of feeling. Because of this, each song has different atmospheres. From dark, depressive and sad, to uptight, energetic and full of rage, to even sometimes a little bit hopeful, but not for long... 

In 2012, a second album was released: The clouds are burning.
