The Execute were a Japanese hardcore punk band one of the earliest example of punk changing into hardcore punk in Japan. Formed in 1982, they took cues from diverse influences such as Japan's early punkers The SS and the galloping metal of Motörhead. They released several 7″s and appeared on a couple of classic Japanese complitions, “Great Punk Hits” and later “A Farewell To Arms”. They also were on a few other international compilations. All their records, including the “Hardcore Temptation” 7″, the “Criminal Flowers” 7″ and the “Blunt Sleazy” 7″/12″ are excellent. There was also a cassette release in 1984 called “Live in Hell”.

In late 1985, line up changes in the band, including Baby and later Baki forming/joining Gastunk, changed Execute's sound. Anything after the above mentioned releases get pretty sketchy and aren’t recommended. Pusmort records re-released the “Blunt Sleazy” record as a split 12″ with Germany's Inferno and there was also a legitimate discography LP called “Save Your Money” with all their early material and some unreleased live material from 1982. The discography is long out of print (even though it’s been bootlegged recently). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Execute">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
