Starting in 2001 as a 2 man indie-metal wrecking crew, Mico de Noche has continually refined its version of modern heavy music. Now, with 3 previous releases and multiple shows and tours under their collective belt, the duo of Don Stewart & Mike Clam have welcomed fellow veteran of a thousand psychic wars, Chad Baker, into the fold on the electric bass guitar, and Reno Dave on drums.

In 2003, MdN was named one of the top 10 metal bands by the Seattle Weekly. Over the past six years, the band has played extensively throughout the Northwest and West coast opening for such acts as High on Fire, Jucifer, Big Business, The Blood Brothers, Kinski, C-Average, Chrome, and Totimoshi. They have made appearances at Wantage Records Totalfest four times from 2003-2006, and have played showcases at SXSW in 2004 and 2005. Currently they are in the
middle of production on their next CD and are planning shows/tours for the
upcoming year. Cherries was released in 2007 on Australian Cattle God records.

In 2009 Mico de Noche teamed up with Pacific Northwest grunge legend Tad Doyle and his new band Brothers of the Sonic Cloth, to release a split 10" vinyl single with digital download. This release has been met with uniformly positive critical acclaim.
