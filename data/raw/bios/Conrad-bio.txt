(Barbadian Metal Band)
Conrad was summoned on August 5th 2009 and have since released two demos which reflect heavily on empathy and dark fantasy. On the band’s first anniversary, Oseaan Kroniek is created and goes deep onto the profound void of the Caribbean Sea; sharing tales of Neptune, Olokun and Stede Bonnet.

Conrad recently drifted into the sinister side of the Pagan Caribbean Roots invoking Orishas and unleashing pure Afro-Pandemonium. The upcoming –Conrad Within- demo will showcase far more darker and ritualistic themes and sounds while scratching the surface of Conrad’s potential.

Beware! Pure Pagan Bajan Metal Is Near! Iba Exu!
