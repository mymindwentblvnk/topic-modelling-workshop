1.)Odhinn was formed in early 1995 by two Swedish men named John Östlund and John Frölén who had both played with In Battle before. They were soon offered a two album deal with Napalm Records. In 2000 they recorded a third album entitled "The Past Will Rise Again" which was meant to be released in the winter 2000 / 2001 but it has still not been released for some reason. The current status of the band is inactive.
