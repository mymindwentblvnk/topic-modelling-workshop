Autumn 2011. Drabbad (Lepra, Suicide) had spent a few years institutionalized. He was now getting himself ready to face the outside world once again. Pessimisten, (Apati, then known as C9H13N) had recently disbanded his former band, as a result of the death by overdose of one of the members. The two ended up starting Ofdrykkja, and just a few months later, The Associate (Death under siege, Suicide) Arkomann and BÃ¶deln joined them.

'Ofdrykkja' means "excessive drinking" in Old Norse, and pretty much explains the theme of the lyrics and musical influence for the band.

The main valuation of Ofdrykkja is to reflect our view of our contemporaries which often can be quite tangled and complex. But we try to be honest with what we do and do not exaggerate or fictitious catch on with this scene's culture of total negativity. Though we sometimes use extreme expressions (as a kind of visual art or authentic presentations). But those incidents that rarely happens and affects the members of the band are unfortunately parts of our lives. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ofdrykkja">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
