Facing the Swarm Thought create a raw blend of chaotic blasts, grinding grooves and doom like spheres combined with aggressive, distressed vocals. Since the founding in 2007 and several lineup changes, the musical tastes of the different members, which are settled in the fields of metal, doom, hardcore and sludge, lead to this evolution of sound, which finally has become manifest in the latest record Damnati, recorded in 2010. In 2011, group signed with Ampire Records. Augsburg, Germany.
