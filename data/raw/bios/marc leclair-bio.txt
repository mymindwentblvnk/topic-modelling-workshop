Better known for his work as Akufen, Marc Leclair released in 2005 an album called ”Musique Pour 3 Femmes Enceintes”, integrating instrumental tones, outer-space noises accompanied by malfunctioning machinery pounding with a crackling heartbeat of sound.

The album was conceived while Leclair's wife and several of her friends were all pregnant at the same time. Over the course of album, each labeled according to a point in the pregnancy ("64th Day," "205th Day," etc.), Leclair attempts to convey the moods of the experience.
