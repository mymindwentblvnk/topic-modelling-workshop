According to the Da Dip Songfacts, Freak Nasty was born Carlito Timmons in Puerto Rico. He was raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. Da Dip  was the only Top-40 hit for the rapper. However, in a very rare phenomenon, that single also went platinum! It sold over a million copies by June of '97. To be fair, Freak Nasty has also charted other singles onto the US R&B and US Rap charts.
