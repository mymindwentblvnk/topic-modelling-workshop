Back in 2000, in the town of Fredericksburg, Virginia, there was a band called Forever Dusk. Forever Dusk was a goth/progressive/bm band with much potential, but "musical differences" made the band go their seperate ways.

"We wanted a more brutal band, so we started to write standard death metal music. Somehow, in the midst of clove smoke and a fetish for stringed instruments, we started writing melodic music again (including Merlinus's two symphonic pieces!). The music was much more complex and beautiful than that of our former band; and, though death metal is fun to play, it just suited us much better." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Atromorta">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
