Arizona 3 piece featuring members of Misanthropic. Lots of crossover in musical styles but this definitely leans towards the metal end of things, drawing influences from bands such as Carcass, ABC Diabolo, Ass√ºck and Dystopia. Lyrics are both personal and political in a brutally honest way.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sea+Of+Deprivation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
