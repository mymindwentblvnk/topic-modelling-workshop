Genghis Tron is a three-piece band from Poughkeepsie, USA.

The trio formed in early 2004 where they met as students at Vassar College. They recorded a demo in 2004 entitled Laser Bitch, and released their debut EP Cloak Of Love the following year.

"Dead Mountain Mouth", the band's first full-length, was released by the same label the following year. The newer material was a more well-blended and demented attack, focusing less on the cut-and-paste mayhem of the early songs and instead honing in on flow, song structure, and originality creating what has never been created before.

They have completed recording "Board Up the House", their second full-length album. It was released in February 2008. As of October 2010, they were on an indefinite hiatus.

In August 2020, the band announced that they got back together in a new lineup and that they will release a new album on Relapse Records in 2021. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Genghis+Tron">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
