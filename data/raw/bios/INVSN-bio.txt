INVSN (pronounced "Invasionen") is a music project of the Swedish hardcore musician Dennis Lyxz√©n. In contrast to his other projects, Refused, AC4 and The (International) Noise Conspiracy, this started out as a solo career and much more folkish and softer than his prior music endeavours. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/INVSN">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
