Norwegian melodic and progressive hardrock band P:O:B (Pedestrians of Blue) has devoloped a unique style that has been descibed as mix of bands like Queensrÿche, Black Sabbath and Toto.

The band has recorded two EP's which both received great reviews and spawned interest from various record companies around the world. The band, however, decided to finish their first full-length album without signing to anyone and now the first full length album is about to be released in Norway on their own FishFarm label. The official release date of "Crossing Over" in Norway is June 4. and the album will be distributed by Mudi Musikkdistribusjon.

"Crossing Over" was produced by the founding band members Torfinn Sirnes (guitars) and Johannes Støle (vocals) and was mixed by Daniel Flores and mastered by Mika Jussila. The concept album tells the story of young man's dramatic journey between family, love and religion - and takes the listener on a varied musical journey - from the straightforward and radio friendly "Promises" to the epic and progressive "Out of the Rain".
