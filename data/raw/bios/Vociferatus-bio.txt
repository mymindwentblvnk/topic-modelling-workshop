Vociferatus is a Black Metal band from the city of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Formed in 2008 by Pedrito Hildebrando (vocals), Luiz Felipe Mallet (guitar) and Augusto Taboransky (drums), and is a new promise from the brazilian extreme scene.

With two releases so far (self titled Demo, 2010 and the EP "Blessed By The Hands Of Flames", 2011), the band has achieved good visibility and reaping the rewards of a concise work.

The group has a strong musical influence from bands like Behemoth, Marduk, Belphegor and also uses lyrical devices based on contemporary events, such as wars and side effects of society, Mesopotamian and Egyptian mythologies, literature and religious questioning.
