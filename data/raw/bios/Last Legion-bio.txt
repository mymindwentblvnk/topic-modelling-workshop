Hailing from all corners of New York City, Last Legion concocts a unique blend of catchy riffs and unrelenting brutality that aims not only to pulverize ear drums, but put an American spin on a generally European-dominated sound.

The lyrical themes draw heavily from Norse and Viking mythology, as well as the strife and bloodbath of celestial war.

Last Legion is comprised of Jason Ayala on vocals, Christopher Sampath and Jeremy Farfan on guitars, Martin Tune on bass, and Adam Bauch on drums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Last+Legion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
