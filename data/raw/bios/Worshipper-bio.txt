There are multiple artists named Worshipper:

1) Worshipper is a Swedish black metal project started in 1996 featuring Fredrik SÃ¶derlund of Puissance, Parnassus and Octinomos, to name a few of his bands. Musically quite similar to Parnassus and Octinomos but with less keyboards. The only release is Promo '96, which mentions on its cover that a debut album was planned for release in 1997 by Secula Delenda. Unfortunately this didn't happen.

2. Worshipper is a heavy metal band from Boston, Massachusetts. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Worshipper">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
