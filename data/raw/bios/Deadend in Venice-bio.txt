Formed in late 2008, Deadend in Venice tried right from the beginning to combine the power of true Melodic Death Metal with the beauty of a clear female voice. A short three song demo was recorded at the end of the same year and first local club-gigs followed. In 2009 the band shared the stage with names like Tristania, Finntroll and Tanzwut on some bigger shows and played great concerts for both, crowd and band.

During the year 2010 the band decided to get all the stuff together for a full-length album and through CASKET Music and PLASTICHEAD the chance was given for worldwide distribution. The productions started in November and 2011 will be the year for: See you on the ground!
