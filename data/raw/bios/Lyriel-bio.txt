Lyriel is a folk metal band formed in Gummersbach in 2003. They describe their style as 'dark romantic celtic rock' and can be easily compared to Blackmore's Night and various symphonic metal bands, although they do not copy these bands. They are also notable for frontwoman Jessica Thierjung's vocals, which add a unique touch to their already distinguishable sound. Additionally, they feature the cello and violin on stage.

They have released four albums: Prisonworld, Autumntales, Paranoid Circus and Leverage. Their latest Album Skin and Bones will be released in September 2014.
