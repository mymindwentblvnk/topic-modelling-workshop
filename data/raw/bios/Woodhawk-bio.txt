Made of equal parts 1970s Birmingham and a myriad of 21st century heavy who’s who, Calgary trio Woodhawk are purveyors of riff centric rock and roll. Capable and original, the band is able to craft anthemic fist pumping songs while forgoing tired stoner rock clichés. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Woodhawk">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
