2ncuk is a death/grind band formed in 2004 in Depok, Indonesia. As of 2005, its line-up consists of Nico (guitar, vocals), Randa (bass), Ican (Guitar) and Tio (drum) 2ncuk is often described as classic death/grind, and the band is renowned for its classical proficiency.

2ncuk's music is a hybrid of death metal, grindcore and hardcore, characterized by extremely fast blast beats, easy riffing, harmonic guitar duel, classical lead, and vintage sound. Lyrics-wise, the band dabbled in the ordinary daily life subject matter on their early albums, however, they had practically completely shifted to nihilism lyrics. The lyrics are quite weird, funny, mostly consisting of useless argument addressed towards things such as their life, organization, corporations, consumerism and sometimes war.
