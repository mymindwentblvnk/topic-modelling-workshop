Rolf Kühn (29 September 1929 - 18 August 2022) was a German jazz clarinetist and saxophonist.

Rolf Kühn's style has evolved through the years. The clarinetist started out playing in German dance bands in the late '40s. He worked with radio orchestras starting in 1952 and moved to the U.S. in 1956. Kühn subbed for Benny Goodman on a few occasions during 1957-1958, played in the Tommy Dorsey ghost band (1958), and worked in a big band led by Urbie Green (1958-1960). In 1962, Kühn returned to Germany, where he has explored more adventurous styles of jazz (including dates with his younger brother, keyboardist Joachim Kühn) but still occasionally shows off his ties to swing. Kühn recorded with an all-star group called Winner's Circle (1957), Toshiko Akiyoshi (1958), and as a leader starting in 1953, including a 1956 New York quartet date for Vanguard. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rolf+K%C3%BChn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
