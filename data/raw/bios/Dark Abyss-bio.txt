Name: Dark Abyss 
Country: USA
Status: Active
Description: This one man project is basically droning funeral doom meets darkwave. It's the offspring of Ssad who also has a lot of other one man projects outside the doom genre. The nihilistic sound of the first two demos can perhaps best be compared to Funerary Dirge and Until Death Overtakes Me. The third one is far colder and ends up deeper into a Nortt-like funeral doom territory.
