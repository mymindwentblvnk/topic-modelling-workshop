Sabazius formed in 2006. Deciding to avoid the commercial aspects of making music, the band have made most of their releases available as free downloads. After a brief hiatus at the end of ’09 / beginning of ’10 to concentrate on Funeral Hag, Sabazius will commence releasing material again mid 2010.
