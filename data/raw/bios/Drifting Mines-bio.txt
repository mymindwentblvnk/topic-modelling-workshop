Drifting Mines are an indie/alternative rock band from Rome.

Originally started as a solo project by singer/songwriter Adalberto, the Drifting Mines project soon turned into a proper band.
After many line-up changes the band finally found stability in early 2007, with the members being Adalberto as lead vocals and guitars, Carlo as the second guitarist, Andrea at the keyboards, Gino at the bass and Teo at the drums.
Back in 2006, when still consisting in just a duo (Andrea and Adalberto) Drifting Mines had released a demo titled "Hawaii Dreaming" containing three songs: "Honey", "The Revelations" and "Tonight".
In 2007 they recorded two more tracks, "Oh Yeah Dancer" and "The Butterfly Effect".
