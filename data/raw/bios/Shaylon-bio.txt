Shaylon is a symphonic rock band originally from San Francisco (CA), USA. It was formed in July 2014 by an idea from Charly Urso, guitarist and main composer. The initial intent was to blend together the power of rock and heavy metal with the symphonic spirit of classical music and the great melodies of modern pop. The group sees involved some of the best musicians of the Bay Area such as Tina Diggs on vocals, Alex Tamas on bass and Marco Bicca on Drums. Shaylon just finished recording their debut EP called "Forgotten Realms of Wonders". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shaylon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
