Scoring pure glaciation, the noise of absent values, ice and wintriness – that’s what HYEMS stands for.

Through the trials and tribulations of teenage angst DM and AEJ created 1997 an image of a band which should transfer their inner anger and disillusion into noise. The idea of hiems was born. Driven by the enthusiasm of the black metal wave all over Europe back then they were able to find combatants. The first real line-up was formed 2000. After different demo recordings and style experiments hiems signed 2007 their first record deal with restrain records to publish ANTINOMIE. Forced to change their name due to legal reasons they swaped the “i” into “y”.

Years later after several victories, defeats and losses HYEMS is ready to touch-and-go for a last time. Free from encumbrances and remembering the reasons for creating this band hyems is playing fucking black metal once again – beyond trends, hypes and vanity.

Ever since HYEMS is releasing new material following the banner of Black Metal: 2013 the EP “Im Jetzt die Asche” was released – followed by the full length album “Devianz – Dem Menschen ein Wolf“, released by Bret Hard Records. In September 2018 the EP “1997“ hits the stores: a 90s Black Metal homage to celebrate the band’s roots without denying the trademarks of HYEMS or its anti-NSBM attitude. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hyems">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
