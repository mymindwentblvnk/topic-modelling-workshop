Evictus joined in the year of 2003 in Vit√≥ria, ES, Brazil, with the purpose of mix the influences of its members, which are doom, black and others types of metal. Since from the begining, the band tried to create musics that could express the feelings and introspection of their creativity, whitout lose agressiveness and punch as well. The group quited the use of keyboards, with the goal of enhanced the heavier side of the compositions. Majors influences are Candlemass and My Dying Bride. 

Evictus (eh-VICK-tuss) came from the latin verb Evincere which has two different meanings. In a way, it means to take back something that was taken from you by force and given to a third person. In other way, its the felling of that third person, when discover the need to give up of that thing and give it back to the real owner. The lyrics concept concerns about these differents feelings, the eternal cycle of try to take the thing (or person, or feeling) back, and at the same time, the frustration of give it back to someone. 

After several gigs in 2004 and 2005, Evictus entered the Dourados studio to record its self-titled first demo. On 02/11 2006, the demo was finally available on a very special concert. 

The set list is actually made of the four songs available on the demo and covers of My Dying Bride, Theatre of Tragedy, Paradise Lost, Candlemass and others. Now Evictus is writing new songs for a full-lenght album and promote the demo.  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Evictus">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
