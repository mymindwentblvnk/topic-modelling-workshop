After the release of  "A New Area for Our Plagues"  the band signed with "Siege of Amida Records" which would allow the band to push their abilities and show off there skills & strengths. "Aeon's War" was the full-length debut release which came out in 2011, the album shows a vast improvement of technical understanding without losing the energy that was captured on the EP.
