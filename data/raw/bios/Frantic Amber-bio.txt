In 2008 guitarist Mary SÃ¤fstrand founded Frantic Amber with the idea to have a band that could deliver more attitude and brute force than others in death metal. In 2009 Frantic Amber finally found a true metal vocalist in Elizabeth from Denmark.

They released Burning Insight in 2015 and got traction with Bellatrix on 2019, a work focused on female warriors like Boudicca (queen of the Iceni tribe), Lozen (indian from the Cheyenne tribe), Khutulun (mongol princess), Nakano Takeko (leader of the female division Joshitai), Khawlah bint al Azwar (''the black knight''), Grainne o' Malley (famous irish pirate that fought against British), Lyudmila Pavlichenko (soviet snipet that slain 200 foes) and Lagertha (a shield-maiden from vikings folklore).
