There are more than one artist with this name:

1) Polka'n'Roll band from Stuttgart - Hiss.
2) Ambient drone duo from Australia.
3) An incorrect tag for a rock band from Atlanta, Georgia - The Hiss.


1) The story of Hiss began in the early part of 1995 in Stuttgart. Stefan Hiss was an accordion player and singer.The other band members came from  Erich und das Polk.In summer and autumn of the same year they started giving concerts at festivals and clubs. The members nearly stayed the same since then. 
The style of Hiss, which the band themselves calls Polka'n'Roll, is a opinionated mix of different kinds of folk and rock and roll music. Blues, country and latin influences play as much a role as polka and waltz.

2) Hiss released a CD called Alien Bass Soundscapes, performed by Hiss and composed by Jaz and Omen in 1998 on Agrocalm Records.
