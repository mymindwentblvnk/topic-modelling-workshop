Shattered Eyes is a death metal/grindcore band from San Diego/Tijuana, California.

"Shattered Eyes started with the objective of playing music that we love, not because is a trend or because is something everybody is listening to nowadays, we don't write our music thinking "Let's do a breakdown so people can throw punches or let's do a 2-step so they can dance". We think only about us being pleased with the music we're writing and the feeling that you get when you listen to a riff that makes your heart pump faster and want to headbang your head off. All of us have different influences but we try to keep our music to a level which we can all enjoy.We combine the "Old-School" type of Death Metal with the "New Death Metal" bringing forth a sound that makes you want to hit the person right next to you. With precise blast beats, killer growls, heavy guitars and ballsy bass, Shattered Eyes has become a well-known and respected act in the underground scene of Tijuana".

The current line up is: 
Enrique Ramirez - Vox, 
Jorge Beltran - Guitar,
Mario Jimenez - Guitar, 
Tony Porras - Bass,
Tim Monarres - Drums.
