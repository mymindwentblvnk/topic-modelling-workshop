Coming into being in 2011, Lee Bates is an electronic music producer from Atlanta, GA with a focus on capturing the essence of childhood, manic depression, bad anime, and sleep deprivation. Utilizing bass music as a medium to express these wonders/horrors, he has captured the attention of several veteran DJs and producers in the dance music scene. With an astounding amount of music in his vault, and releases on releases on OWSLA, Dim Mak, Subhuman, Play Me, Mad Decent, and Atlantic records, MUST DIE! is a human factory of quirky dance-floor smashers and anthemic, arena-sized melodies and leads. Not to mention music that is reminiscent of being lost in an 8-bit jungle with a high-grade fever while eating sour candy. At the end of the day, MUST DIE! is a well-rounded, oddly engaging, slightly charming, horrible awkward mess of a human with an affinity for creation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MUST+DIE%21">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
