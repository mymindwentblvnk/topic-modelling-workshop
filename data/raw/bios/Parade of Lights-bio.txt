Parade of Lights are an alt-electro band based in Los Angeles. Comprised of core members Ryan Daly and Anthony Improgo, the group combines equal parts rock, new wave, and shoegaze to create a unique blend of 80's influenced pop drawing on inspiration from artists like U2, Depeche Mode, M83, and even Madonna.

Shortly after meeting in 2006, Daly and Improgo formed the band Polus. After releasing a four-song EP entitled "Wish" and garnering a significant buzz in the L.A. area, Polus was put on hiatus due to considerable demand for both Daly and Improgo as touring musicians. Even with their rigorous touring schedules, the two managed to keep their friendship intact and exchanged song ideas via email until 2010 when they decided to officially reunite as Parade of Lights. They spent that year and 2011 releasing new music and playing shows in Southern California, Utah and Nevada, opening for artists like Imagine Dragons, Marcy Playground, Light FM, Rooney, Stamps, and Ringside among others.


Recent music film and TV placements have gained the band considerable attention from music and TV insiders, not to mention a legitimate core group of dedicated fans. The exposure along with POL's hook-laden songs and entertaining live show, led to a publishing deal December 2011 with Imagem Music.

The band's latest effort, an EP entitled "Born To Live, Born To Love", was released in September of 2012..
