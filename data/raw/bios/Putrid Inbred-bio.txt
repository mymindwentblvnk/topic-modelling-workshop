Putrid Inbred was constructed way back in 1999 in Ronse (Belgium). They started playing death metal with grind influences and recorded a first demo two years later entitled “Flesh Over Religion”, who brought them some nice shows and underground appreciation. 

In 2006, after some line-up changes and the coming of a second vocalist, they recorded a song for the FYU 4 sampler, “ The Art Of Cooking Human Kidneys”, this song was a breakthrough for the band and brought them a deal with Shiver Records.

Putrid Inbred is nothing but a solid act, performing Death Metal for those who have a weak spot for ultra guttural vocals, heavy ass breakdowns, intense blasting, and flawless musicianship. A winning recipe. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Putrid+Inbred">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
