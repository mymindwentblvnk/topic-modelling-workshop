(Doom/Black) 'Horror Black Metal' band from Massachusetts.
Bio Cobwebs of Deception :
Fear, Hunger, and Sexual Depravity, the ecstacy of illusion that resonates inside your head giftwrapped with our blood music. Let your ears desire our black fire with a mournful haunting. Let the seduction of darkness begin as a hurtful throb growing stronger inside of you. Stand before the black abyss in awe, and drink our venom from the challice, we have such sights to show you.

All Music Written & Recorded by:

The Reverend John Hex (guitarist Vintage Flesh)

and

Orpheus
