DIABOLICAL are a Swedish Death Metal band that were formed late 1996 by S.Widgren who now is the only original member still active in the band. DIABOLICAL have been influenced by the well-known Thrash/Death-Metal pioneers like DARK TRANQUILLITY, DEATH, CARCASS and AT THE GATES. In January 2000 DIABOLICAL recorded their first CD-release, entitled "Deserts of Desolation". In April 2001 DIABOLICAL returned to studio and mixed the experience about latest Swedish Metal together to a great "Synergy". DIABOLICAL went on to record their next album in Semptember 2001, confirmed by the positive feedback about the debut-album "Synergy". The sound of the second album "A Thousands deaths" is more aggressive and more straight to the point than the music on "Synergy". The band's third full-length CD, "The Gallery of Bleeding Art", was released in November 2008 through ViciSolum Productions.  DIABOLICAL's latest album, "Ars Vitae", came out in February 2011 via Abyss Records. 
June 2012 DIABOLICAL have entered Necromorbus Studio (WATAIN, UNANIMATED, DESTRÖYER 666) in Alvik, Sweden to begin recording their fifth album, "Neogenesis". The CD is once again being produced by the band's vocalist/guitarist Sverker Widgren.
