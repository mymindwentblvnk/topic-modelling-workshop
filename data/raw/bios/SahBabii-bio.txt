SahBabii was born in Chicago, Illinois and raised in the city's south side in the Wentworth Gardens projects. His aunt, TeeBaby, gave him the moniker "SahBabii" at a young age. In early 2010 at the age of 13 his family moved to Atlanta in pursuance of his older brother T3's career in music., the brace-faced warbler from the city's ninth ward whose breakout hit “Pull Up Wit Ah Stick” feels like a euphoric rush of laughing gas. The song has been remixed by T-Pain, Fetty Wap, and Wiz Khalifa, received co-signs from Drake, Young Thug, Metro Boomin, and Lil Uzi Vert, and earned SahBabii a major label deal with Warner Records.

In June 2017, SahBabii would rerelease his "S.A.N.D.A.S" project with some remastering and 3 new bonus tracks. A year later on August 29, 2018, SahBabii would release his "Squidtastic" project which would include the song "Anime World". In October 2018, SahBabii announced via Twitter that his next project titled "Wolverine" would be his last project. Since then SahBabii has gone on to release his EP titled "3P" in February 2019 and his album titled "Barnacles" in July 2020. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SahBabii">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
