For nearly a decade, Wolf + Lamb has prided itself on procuring and presenting some of the finest gourmet music from around the world. Using nothing but two turntables and a steadfast determination to make people move, the duo have been lighting up dance-floors in New York and around the globe. 

The partnership was struck when the two discovered a similar penchant for new and exotic dance styles from abroad and an innate ability to tolerate each other for long periods of time. The two immediately set out to spread their vision of community, music and the celebration that ties it all together.

In 2005, with opening of Wolf + Lamb Music, their variety label has become a home for established and rising young talent the likes of Seth Troxler, Shaun Reeves, Deniz Kurtel, Nicolas Jaar, No Regular Play & Soul Clap, publishing original music, edits and everything in between. While leaning towards house, the duo and label's sound encompass nuevo disco, hipster crossover, sex house and strains country.

Since then, it has grown to include three record labels, well over 100 community dances -- and counting, a clothing line, a legendary 6 star hotel and club, and, their new line of organic pet food: Woof & Lamme.

Whilst nobody can tell for certain what the future holds, we'd wager them celebrating life, liberty and the pursuit of a satisfying melody well into the future. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wolf+%252B+Lamb">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
