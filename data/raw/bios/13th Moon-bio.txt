13th Moon is a Spanish black metal band with some death metal influence and atmospheric dark ambient parts. Lyrical themes rotate around Necromancy, Death, Cthonic Gnosticism. 13th Moon has released two demos The Pale Spectre over the Worm (2013) and Oracle of Death (2013). In 2014 the first full length album Abhorrence of Light was released, which had a clearer yet very atmospheric recording quality. 

Three years later, in 2017 13th Moon emerged with one track on a split release with Ritual Death from Norway. The track was called Veneration of the Mighty Dead.

2018 saw the rerelease of the first two demos as a compilation, but the band also released another new demo with four tracks, which was called Shrouded in Grave Soul. It consisted of three atmospheric dark ambient tracks and one longer track in their usual style. 

In spring 2021 they released Putridarium EP: one long track which had guest vocals from Cultes Des Ghoules.
