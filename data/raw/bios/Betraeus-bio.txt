Emerging from Manchester, 4 piece metal band Betraeus mix styles of Jazz, Ambient, world music and all things heavy to create their very own haunting and powerful sound. Using a wide range of musical techniques they are always searching to push the boundaries of modern metal. From epic sweeping melodies incorporating ebows, vocal harmonies and groovy bass lines to blast beats, a menacing growl and face melting dual guitar work your ears are in for a treat. In a time where music is all about the haircut and tight jeans, Betraeus are hell bent on hammer smashing this scene and bringing British metal back to the music!!! A definite hit for true metal heads and musicians or fans of Machine Head, Opeth, Decapitated and the unexpected!
