Bloodbound is 6 piece heavy metal band founded in 2004 by Fredrik Bergh and Tomas Olsson. Primary influnces include classic heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, and power metal bands such as Helloween and HammerFall.

Their debut album Nosferatu received attention from numerous magazines and websites, and has gained many positive reviews. Following this, Bloodbound played several shows in their home country, Sweden, and with well known metal bands such as Arch Enemy, Dark Tranquillity, Evergrey, and HammerFall.

In 2006, the follow up to their debut was released - "Book of the Dead" followed a simular direction as Nosferatu did, but featured a new member, Michael Bormann on vocals, originally the singer of Jaded Heart.

Urban Breed, the singer of Bloodbound, left briefly in 2006 to be replaced by Michael  but Urban Breed recently replaced him once again. Now, the band is working on their third album, which is due to be released in September 2008.

Despite the band's apparent black metal image (the band members have worn make-up in the "corpse paint" style in the promotional photos on their albums and Web site, and during some live shows), Bloodbound's music does not fit into the black metal category. Instead, it is more similar in style to power metal bands such as Helloween and Iron Maiden, although the lyrics sometimes approach darker subjects.

In 2009 the band signed a worldwide deal with the label Blistering Records, for their third album release titled Tabula Rasa. The album was set for release on April 26, 2009.
