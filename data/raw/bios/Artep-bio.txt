Artep is Black metal band hailing from Canada. Artep initiated the band in January 2006. In 2007, Lord Goatesque agreed to add drums and vocals to the latest recordings.
Agressive fast guitar work, dustructive drums, grim/raw vocals and haunting melodies characterize Arteps sound. An awesome live sound and amazing performance is what will set this band apart from others.
