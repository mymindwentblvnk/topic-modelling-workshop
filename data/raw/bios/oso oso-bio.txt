Oso Oso is the latest project of Jade Lilitri out of Long Beach, New York. After a couple of early records, the band self-released their first fully realized album The Yunahon Mixtape on Bandcamp in early 2017. Despite this low key release, the album quickly gained traction across the scene, winning over both fans and critics with it's diverse, recognizable knack for memorable choruses and instantly relatable lyrics. Pitchfork said " Lilitri is as much of a student of his influences as he is a fan, understanding the exact methods that make the sound of this music hit a certain way at a certain age and linger in the years to come." In 2018 the band was signed by Triple Crown Records, who have reissued The Yunahon Mixtape.
