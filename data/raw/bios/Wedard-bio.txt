Wedard is a black metal band from Memmingen, Germany, founded at the end of 2002 by Sternenfrost as a one-man solo project.
The target was to play depressive and melancholic black metal. After some long breaks and releasing some unofficial demos, at the beginning of 2005 the first official demo "...von Liebe und Waldern" was released. This demo was largely only for friends and happened to be released by Sternenfrost himself.
In the middle part of 2005 Sternenfrost searched for a human drummer, because he no longer wanted programmed drums. So Necro was then instated as a permanent member of Wedard. Sternenfrost decided that no more members would be joining Wedard, he wishes to work alone through this project and does so to this day with the help of AJS who has now replaced Necro contributing only through session drums.
In October of 2008 Karmageddon (Happy Days, Managarm, Griefthorn) joined Wedard as the permanent drummer and has contributed to all releases since "Beyond the Light" (split with Nocturnal Depression). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wedard">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
