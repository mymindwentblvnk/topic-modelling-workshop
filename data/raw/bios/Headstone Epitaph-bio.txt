Headstone Epitaph is a Metal band from Germany playing traditional Heavy Metal.

The band was founded in Mosbach, Baden-Württemberg in 1987 by Jürgen Steinmetz and Steffen Hußlik and was at first known as "Headstone" but later changed the name to "Headstone Epitaph". Reason was the existence of another band having the same name.

After several years of stagnation the band celebrates his comeback in 2008 with new live shows.
