After developing respectable solo careers as DJs and producers, long-time friends Billy Bennett (Billy the Gent) and Long Phung (Jawns) officially banded together as Gent & Jawns becoming an unstoppable force in the world of club music. The release of their now classic Moombahton anthem "Vibrate" catapulted them to the top of everyone's list of producers to work with and landed them remixes for Datsik, Bare, and Muffler, as well as collaborations with Nadastrom, Torro Torro and JWLS. Shortly after, they released "Holler," their first official EP on Mad Decent's Jeffrees label. Jeffrees went on to earn the iTunes Label of the Year honors. While known for their world-class production, Gent & Jawns' secret weapon is their ability to perform live. 

Jawns is a legend in his hometown of Richmond, VA, where he is widely known for throwing the biggest and best parties the city has seen in years. 

Billy The Gent began DJing with support from his friend Dave Nada (Nadastrom, creator of Moombahton) in Washington, DC and quickly became a staple at the famous U-Street Music Hall. Together, Gent & Jawns have gone on to share the stage with top notch acts like Diplo, Dillon Francis, Nadastrom, Caspa, Craze, Die Antwoord, and more.

The duo split up with Gent leaving the project, Jawns remaining as the frontman. Eventually he switched names to just Jawns <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gent+&+Jawns">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
