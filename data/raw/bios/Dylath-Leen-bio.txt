The French melodic Death Metal band DYLATH-LEEN, utilising an alchemy of female vocals alternating growls and spellbinding clear voices, male-death-metal vocals, ethereal keyboards, original bass lines, loud and technical drums and "Carcass-influenced" guitars, was created in Sept. 1999.

With Bertrand Oria (drums), Kathy Coupez (guitars, clean & harsh vocals), Carine Pochet (keyboards), Igor Landorique (guitars, harsh vocals) & Jeremy Mairesse (bass guitar) the album 'Insecure' introduced the world to Dylath-Leen's enraged, tormented and atmospheric style.

This lineup changed in 2001 with Arnaud Brabant (drums) and Magali Seguy (keyboards) replacing Bertrand and Carine.  This lineup changed once again with the departure of Arnaud and Magali, and the return of Bertrand in 2008.

March 2008 saw the release of 'Seme√Øon' a crushing album that is convincingly ruthless and catchy. 

Dylath-Leen is a fictional city in H. P. Lovecraft's Dream Cycle and appears in 'The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath' (1926).  Lovecraft also plays an important role in the bands lyrics and visual presence. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dylath-Leen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
