Vixenta is a depressive black metal/shoegaze band formed as a solo side project by B in mid-2010 as a solo project, after writing material which did not fit with "main" band, Eternal Execration. 3 Demo songs were recorded in late 2010, and went unreleased to the public. Soon after, by Spring 2011, J. Zammit joined in on guitar and vocals. Two demo albums were then recorded, and were released online (Now unavailable).

By Autumn 2012, Vixenta and Psycho Originals were in contact over releasing an album, and recruited Celestial Hierarchy vocalist, The Chancellor. In January 2013 "A Moment in Solace" was released digitally, as well as a physical copy getting released in December 2013. The band is currently working on their EP "Predation" to come out July - August 2013, as well as material for the future.

B. (Beyond the Dawn, Solar Wanderers, Skylines to Nowhere) - Guitars, Bass, Keys, Lyrics
