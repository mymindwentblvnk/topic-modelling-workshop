Mark Fry (born in Epping, Essex, on 4 November 1952) is an English psychedelic folk musician and also a painter. He is best known for his album "Dreaming with Alice", released in 1972, which has been hailed by critics as a psychedelic folk classic.

 In 1970 Fry enrolled at the Accademia delle Belle Arti in Florence, Italy, where he studied painting. It was in Rome in the summber of 1971 that he recorded his first album "Dreaming with Alice" over a three-day period with a group of session musicians.

Fry's second album, Shooting The Moon, was released in January 2008, 35 years after his debut, the 1972 psych-folk classic Dreaming With Alice, recorded in Rome, Italy. In 2000, Akarma Records bootlegged the album as a CD, with a sleeve closely resembling that of Donovan's Barabajagal. In 2006, Sunbeam Records reissued the album in both CD and gatefold vinyl with the original cover artwork. The rediscovered Dreaming With Alice has been hailed as "a defining masterpiece of psychedelic folk".

In 2011, Fry released a third album, I Lived In Trees as Mark Fry / The A. Lords, a collaboration with Dorset-based musicians The A. Lords. The album was well-received and was followed by another release on Second Language Music, South Wind, Clear Sky, in September 2014. A live album, Mark Fry Live In Japan, was recorded by Mark Fry With The Dreaming Alice Band at a series of concerts in Tokyo in 2013. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Fry">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
