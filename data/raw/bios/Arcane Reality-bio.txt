Arcane Reality is a progressive power metal band from Stockholm, Sweden.

Created in September 2009, the band was formed from members of various other bands, seeking to create the kind of melodic progressive metal they themselves always wanted to hear. The band’s sound can best be described as shifting and moody but with a lot of melodic hooks and big choruses. The band utilizes both male and female vocals.

In early 2010, the band recorded a demo CD called Beyond the Sea and then went out and did a lot of gigs in Stockholm. In March 2012, the band began the recording of their debut album Echoes, with the help of singer Mia Jäger, who couldn’t commit to the band full time.

Echoes have just been released to the public and the band is now searching for a full time female singer, having Mio Jäger join the band for a few selected gigs. The band is also looking for a management company and/or a record company. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arcane+Reality">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
