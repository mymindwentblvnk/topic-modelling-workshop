The band initially formed by 5 members now is a duo which has Estevan Furlan on the drums and vocals and Ricardo Falcon on the guitar and bass showing the real sound and meaning from "Itself".
After a long winding journey, Itself releases its debut cd "make my suffer short" bringing a special participation of Nilton Wood (IB&T and Cover Bass mag - Brazil), artwork done by Killustrations (Germany) and its mix and mastering done at Hertz Studio (Poland).
