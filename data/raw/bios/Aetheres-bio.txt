Aetheres is an Atmospheric Black/Doom Metal project based in North Yorkshire (UK), previously from Koszalin (Poland).  It is founded by Warterz Neur from Gontyna Kry.  The latest album 'Dark Wisdom's Domain' is somewhat comparable to bands like October Tide, and perhaps early Anathema and My Dying Bride, with a slight neo-classical influence in some of the riffs, which brings to mind some elements of 'Anthems...'/'IX Equilibrium'-era Emperor.
