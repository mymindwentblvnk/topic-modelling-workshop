Formed in early 2005 in Brisbane, Australia. Dead Letter Opener met whilst they were studying music and technology at a Brisbane University, and initially formed the group to complete a recording project imperative to two of the members studies. The potential of becoming a full-time was realised almost immediately and DLO set out to finalise their debut EP and secure national distribution for it. Managing to record and produce the entire EP as a band with help from a friend from University, who is now their full-time live sound engineer, a national distribution was secured through MGM/Green Media and Jungle Library Records - an indie label setup by the members of the band. DLO hit the live front at the beginning of 2007 playing with the likes of nationally acclaimed Australian hard rock and metal acts such as Lynchmada and Five Star Prison Cell, capturing fans imaginations all across southeast Queensland and cementing their place in the live Australian metal scene. Putting out a video for a new track "Yours and What's Mine" late in 2008 and supporting artists such as Dillinger Escape Plan and Cradle of Filth saw the band receive some wider attention and recognition.

Their first album, entitled Lumen was released in October 2009.
