There are 4 bands named Dark Earth.

1) After seemingly disappearing for 4 years, everything that DARK EARTH brought to the metal scene was all but forgotten; heavy melodic riffs, ball-tearing blast beats, blistering guitar solos & a TIGHT live show. 
During the time DE were absent, the boys came to realise that the normal "house, wife & kids" road of life wasn't going to work for them, they needed something more...
So now they are BACK, stronger than ever, not only reworking their old material into a newer, more energetic live show, but are now bringing in new songs which are sure to help put DARK EARTH back on the map!

2) Dark Earth is a three piece doom rock/ stoner metal band based in California, formed  in February of 2012 by James Sotelo (guitar/ vocals), Bobby Daly (bass/ vocals), and Kevin Boockholdt (drums). In May of 2012, they recorded their first e.p. "42012", a 30-minute 5 song release recorded at Reeds Recordings in Campbell, CA. In 2013 they signed with F.U. Hollywood, a san jose based record label, who put out their e.p. on a split vinyl release with Bibles & Hand Grenades. Their sound is a combination of 70's hard rock, early metal, doom rock and stoner metal.

3) Based in Iran, Dark Earth has a techno based sound, deeply connected to Iranian and Arab influences and EBM pieces like Das Ich. Their piece Jang(War) has been released on an international compilation of Iranian Underground Music.

4) Dark Earth is czech antihuman black metal band.
