An interesting debut from this self-proclaimed "new-age metal" band. A variety of influences can be heard here, but their basic sound is rooted in 80's hard rock/metal. There are very slight progressive and gothic influences on display here, but not enough to categorize the band as either prog metal, or certainly not gothic. Traces of early Blue Oyster Cult are occasionally heard (this is mostly due to the keyboards), as well as Savatage, Faith No More, and a host of others -- really, no one influence dominates, but rather it is the blending of many influences that gives the band quite an original sound. While both albums retain the same basic style, the newer Lost In Hell is where the band is really starting to come into its own, with more diverse songwriting and a generally more mature presentation. Really, these guys should be signed -- quite interesting.
