Rotting Away is a father/daughter death metal duo from Mexico who formed in April of 2012. The pair released their one-track debut demo, Walking Dead: Infestation, only one month after having been brought to life. Despite having widely received a positive response, the material was passed off as Gutwrench worship due to having a very similar sound; this would be attributed to the fact that guitarist/bassist/drummer Uriel Aguillon is the guitarist/growl vocalist for Gutwrench. The dyad later refined their sound, which is featured on the latest demo, Rise from Decay. Do Rotting Away have what it takes to break away from their association with Gutwrench?
