There are multiple bands with the name Thirst.

1).  Thirst is a Black Metal band from Poland - formed in 1992. Some session members of the band were from a demo band called Sacrificed however, the primary members are Occulta and Wrack. Occulta does all the instruments and some drum programming whereas Wrack basically assists him in the drum programming but, does the bass alone. Their main lyrical themes deal with a strong level of hatred and evil in a nihilistic point of view. Their main influences obtain the sound of Bathory but, strive for rawer more Pagan approaches from the traditional Polish Black Metal scene. The three full-length albums are entitled; "The Might of the Pagan Belief" - 1994, "Per Aspera Ad Astra" - 2004 and "Blacklight" - 2008.
