LOLAWOLF is a trio from New York City fronted by ZoÃ« Kravitz. The band includes Jimmy Giannopoulos and James Levy from Reputante.

The band's debut LP Calm Down will be released worldwide in October 2014 on Innit Recordings via Kobalt Label Services and by Create / Control in AU/NZ. Produced by Jimmy Giannopoulos and recorded earlier this year in the Bahamas and LA, the album finds the band adding hip-hop and tribal elements to their sound. 

Calm Down is the follow-up to the band's critically acclaimed five-song debut EP released earlier in 2013, which Pitchfork described as "surging electronic pop." Neon Gold called lead track "Drive (Los Angeles)" "a perfect piece of distinctive, melody-driven, back-to-the-future synth candy." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lolawolf">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
