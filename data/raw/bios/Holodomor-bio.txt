1. Holodomor are a Black/Death/Thrash Metal band from Plymouth, UK. Formed in 2009, the band's style is a symbiosis of the Aussie/Canadian War Metal scene's primordial violence with some elements of 80s German Thrash and a strong influence of early Morbid Angel-type of Death Metal. The debut MCD - Temoignages de la Gnose Terrestre has been released in April 2012. Holodomor are signed to Iron Bonehead Productions for the release of their debut material on a MLP.
