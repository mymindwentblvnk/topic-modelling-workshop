Fufanu is an Alternative band from Reykjavík Iceland, formerly operating as a techno duo under the alias of Captain Fufanu which formed back in 2008. Huge, great and bleak towers of sound, nimble rhythmic undercurrents. The twin and unlikely ghosts of both post-punk and electronic techno. The current Band members are Kaktus Einarsson (Vocals), Guðlaugur Einarsson (Guitar, Synth, Programming) and Erling Bang (Drums)

Fufanu's front man Kaktus, and guitarist / programmer Guðlaugur, were making music before Fufanu, operating as a techno duo under the alias of Captain Fufanu in 2008. The full ensemble Fufanu emerged after Captain Fufanu had an album recorded and prepared entirely, but the studios in which it was stored was burgled and the music was lost. When forming the band, Fufanu retained the electronic element with synth pads and bass, coupled with drums and two guitars.

The have released 2 albums as of 2018 under the record label One Little Indian Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fufanu">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
